       on the designated host in the cluster:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalastore -action start -nodes <node IP add
resses separated by a space>

    2. Issue the following command to start the catalog service on the
       designated host in the cluster:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalacatalog -action start -nodes <node IP a

    3. Issue the following command to start the Impala server on each
       Impala node:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalaserver -action start -nodes <node IP ad

       Note: Check the Impala log files for errors if the services do not
       start successfully. You can locate log files in the following
       Impala installation directory on each node:
/opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/logs
