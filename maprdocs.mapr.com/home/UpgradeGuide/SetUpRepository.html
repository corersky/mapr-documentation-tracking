Setting Up Repositories

   This section describes how to set up internet and local repositories
   for each operating system.

   Both internet repositories and local repositories can be set up. In
   addition, package files can be downloaded, stored locally, and then
   MapR can be installed from the files. The following sections describes
   how to do both for each operating system.

   Platform-specific upgrade repositories are hosted at:
   [1]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v<version>/<platform>/mapr-v<versio
   n>GA-upgrade.<rpm/deb>.tgz.

   See [2]MapR Repositories and Packages for more information about
   repositories and packages.
