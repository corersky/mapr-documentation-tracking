Upgrading Spark on YARN

   This section describes how to upgrade Spark on YARN without the MapR
   Installer.
   The following instructions explain how to upgrade an existing
   installation of Spark. Spark will be installed in a new subdirectory
   under /opt/mapr/spark.
    1. Install the Spark packages.
       Note: You only need to upgrade the mapr-spark-historyserver if your
       previous installation included this package.

        On Ubuntu

apt-get install mapr-spark mapr-spark-historyserver

        On RedHat / CentOS

yum update mapr-spark mapr-spark-historyserver

        On SUSE

zypper upgrade mapr-spark mapr-spark-historyserver

    2. (Optional): Starting in the MEP 4.0 release, you can install the
       MapR Spark Thrift Server package.

        On Ubuntu

apt-get insall mapr-spark-thriftserver

        On RedHat / CentOS

yum install mapr-spark-thriftserver

        On SUSE

zypper install mapr-spark-thriftserver
