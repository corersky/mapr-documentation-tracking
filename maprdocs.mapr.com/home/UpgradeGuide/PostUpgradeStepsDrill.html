Post-Upgrade Steps for Drill

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Drill with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Configuration files from the previous installation now reside in
       /opt/mapr/drill/OLD_DRILL_VERSIONS. If you have made any changes to
       configuration files in the previous version, compare and restore
       your previous configurations in the
       /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf directory. Also, copy over any
       UDF or custom storage or format plugin JAR files that you added to
       the previous Drill directory.
       Note: The drill-override.conf contains your ZooKeeper configuration
       and any other options specified in the file. The drill-env.sh file
       contains any options that you modified, such as Drill memory
       allocation. The logback.xml file contains changes you may have made
       to use Lilith.
    2. Run configure.sh to refresh the node configuration.
$ /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       Note: Drill should be configured and running on the node. You can
       use one of the following methods to verify that the Drillbit
       service is running on the node:
          + Issue the following command to verify the status of the
            Drillbit service from the command line:
jps
          + Log in to the MCS at https://<host name>:8443 and click
            Services to verify the status of the Drillbit service.
       You should see the Drillbit listed as a service running on the
       node.
    3. Enter the following URL in a web browser to access the Drill Web
       Console and verify that your storage plugin configurations were
       preserved during the upgrade:
http://<IP address or host name>:8047/storage
       If your storage plugins were not preserved, use the back up that
       you took before the upgrade to restore them.
       Note: You can start/stop/restart the Drillbit service on one or
       more nodes using the MCS or the following command:
$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action start|restart|stop -nodes <node
 host names separated by a space>
       Use the host name if possible. Using host names instead of IP
       addresses is a best practice.
       You can access the Drill log files in
       /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/logs/drillbit.log.
