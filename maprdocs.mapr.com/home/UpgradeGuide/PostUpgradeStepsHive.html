Post-Upgrade Steps for Hive

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Hive with or without the
   MapR Installer.
    1. Update the Hive Metastore.
         a. Refer to the README file in the
            /opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/scripts/metastore/upgrade/<metas
            tore_database> directory for directions on updating your
            existing metastore_db schema to work with the new Hive
            version.
            Tip: When you complete the step to run the schema upgrade
            scripts, run the following scripts:

              For upgrades from Hive 0.13 to 1.0:

                   i. upgrade-0.13.0-to-0.14.0.<metastore_database>.sql
                  ii. upgrade-0.14.0-to-1.1.0.<metastore_database>.sql

              For upgrades from Hive 0.13 to 1.2.1:

                   i. upgrade-0.13.0-to-0.14.0.<metastore_database>.sql
                  ii. upgrade-0.14.0-to-1.1.0.<metastore_database>.sql
                  iii. upgrade-1.1.0-to-1.2.0.<metastore_database>.sql

              For upgrades from Hive 1.0 to 1.2.1

                    # upgrade-1.1.0-to-1.2.0.<metastore_database>.sql

            Note: Run the metastore upgrade scripts from the
            /opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/scripts/metastore/upgrade/<metas
            tore_database> directory. The script sources files from this
            directory. If you run the script from another location, it
            will fail.
         b. Verify that the metastore database update completed
            successfully. For example, use these diagnostic tests:
               o Run the show tables command in Hive and make sure it
                 returns a complete list of all your Hive tables.
               o Perform simple SELECT operations on Hive tables that
                 existed before the upgrade.
               o Perform filtered SELECT operations on Hive tables that
                 existed before the upgrade.
    2. Migrate Hive Configuration (optional).
       Migrate any custom configuration settings into the new default
       files in the conf directory (/opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/conf/).
    3. Restart Hive Services.
         a. Make a list of nodes on which Hive Metastore and HiveServer2
            Services are configured.
         b. Issue the maprcli node services command, specifying the nodes
            on which the Hive services are configured.
maprcli node services -name hivemeta -action restart -nodes <space delimited lis
t of nodes>
maprcli node services -name hs2 -action restart -nodes <space delimited list of
nodes>
    4. Run configure.sh. If you installed the mapr-hivewebhcat package,
       run configure.sh with the -R option on the node where you installed
       the mapr-hivewebhcat package.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       This step enables Warden to recognize the newly installed service.
