Pre-Upgrade Steps for Pig

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Pig with or without the
   MapR Installer.

   You need to back up configuration properties files if you made
   configuration changes that you want to carry over to the next version.
    1. Locate the files in /opt/mapr/pig/pig-<version>/conf/ directory.
    2. Copy the files to a location outside the MapR installation.
       After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the updated Pig
       installation using the backup.
