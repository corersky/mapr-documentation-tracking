Migrating to FUSE-based POSIX Clients

   This section describes how to migrate from the POSIX loopback NFS
   Client to the FUSE-based POSIX basic Client.

   The FUSE-based Basic or Platinum POSIX client package is recommended
   for fresh installation and for all new clusters. If you are currently
   running the POSIX loopback NFS client, you can migrate to the
   FUSE-based POSIX basic client package. By default, the system will only
   allow migrating the existing POSIX loopbacknfs client to the FUSE-based
   POSIX basic client. If you choose to upgrade using the existing
   loopbacknfs POSIX client licenses, by default, the system will upgrade
   the selected nodes to the (paid) FUSE-based POSIX basic client. You
   cannot use existing licenses to migrate to the Platinum POSIX client
   package.

   Before upgrading, ensure that the cluster has been upgraded to MapR
   v5.1.0 or higher because the FUSE-based POSIX client can only connect
   to clusters running MapR v5.1.0 or higher.

   To migrate to the FUSE-based POSIX Basic Client:
    1. Stop the existing POSIX-loopbacknfs service, unmount the
       mountpoint, and uninstall the mapr-loopbacknfs POSIX client.
       For more information, see [1]MapR loopbacknfs POSIX Client.
    2. Remove the loopbacknfs service node from the cluster. To remove,
       run the following command:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli node remove -service nfsserver -nodes <node-name>
       If the host has multiple services, run the following command:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli node remove -hostids <service host id>
    3. Install the FUSE-based POSIX basic client package.
       For more information, see [2]Installing a POSIX FUSE Client Package
       on Your Machine. When you install the FUSE-based POSIX client
       package, the licenses for the POSIX-loopbacknfs client will be
       automatically applied to the new client package.
    4. Verify the FUSE-based POSIX client license.
       For more information, see [3]Configuring the MapR FUSE-Based POSIX
       Client.
