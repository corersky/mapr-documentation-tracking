Set Up the Internet Repository: Ubuntu

   This section describes how to add repositories to the sources.list.

   As root or using sudo, you add the repositories to the sources.list.
   The sources.list specifies the URLs to the packages of MapR that you
   want to install. See the [1]Release Notes for the URLs for all release
   packages.
    1. Change to the root user or use sudo.
    2. Add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list, replacing
       <version> with the version of MapR that you want to install.
       MapR 5.2.1 and later
deb http://package.mapr.com/releases/<version>/ubuntu binary trusty
deb http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/ubuntu binary trusty
       MapR 5.2 and earlier
deb http://package.mapr.com/releases/<version>/ubuntu mapr optional
deb http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/ubuntu binary trusty
    3. Update the package indexes.
       apt-get update
    4. If your connection to the Internet is through a proxy server, add
       the following lines to /etc/apt/apt.conf:
Acquire {
Retries "0";
HTTP {
Proxy "http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>";
};
};
