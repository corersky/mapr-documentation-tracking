Performing a Maintenance Update

   Perform a maintenance update when you want to upgrade to a new patch
   version of MapR Core or apply a patch.
   A maintenance update is an update to your installed MapR software that
   does not require configuration-file changes. Performing a maintenance
   update has no effect on the ecosystem packages (MEP components). You
   perform a maintenance update when you want to do either or both of the
   following:
     * Update to a new patch version of MapR Core. For example, you can
       perform a maintenance update to change your MapR Core version from
       MapR 5.2 to MapR 5.2.1. You cannot use a maintenance update to
       change your MapR Core version from a minor version, such as 5.0, to
       another minor version, such as 5.2. Use the Version Upgrade button
       for minor-version upgrades. The Version Upgrade button also permits
       an upgrade to a patch version of MapR Core.
     * Apply a patch. The Maintenance Update page is one of several
       installer screens that offer the Patch file option. See [1]Applying
       a Patch Using the MapR Installer.

   Note: You cannot perform a maintenance update if your current MEP
   version is incompatible with the selected MapR core version. For
   example, you cannot do a maintenance update from MapR 6.0 and MEP 4.0
   to MapR 6.0.1 because MEP 4.0 is not compatible with MapR 6.0.1. For
   MEP and MapR compatibility information, see [2]MEP Support by MapR Core
   Version.
   Note: The maintenance update is an offline update (not a rolling
   update).
   You perform a maintenance update using the MapR Installer. To perform a
   maintenance update:
    1. [3]Update the MapR Installer if necessary. The maintenance update
       feature is available only with MapR Installer 1.5 or later.
    2. Prepare the cluster for a maintenance update by referring to one or
       both of these topics:
          + [4]Preparing to Upgrade MapR Core
          + [5]Verify Cluster Readiness for a Patch
    3. Start the MapR Installer. For more information, see [6]MapR
       Installer.
    4. Click the Maintenance Update button.
    5. Change the MapR Core Version, or install a MapR Core patch, or
       both.
       Important: During patch-file installation, do not refresh the
       browser page while the patch file is being uploaded. Doing so can
       interrupt the upload process.
    6. Click Next to complete the update.
