Mapping to HBase Table Namespaces

   This section describes mapping table namespaces between Apache HBase
   tables and MapR-DB binary tables.

   MapR's implementations of the HBase Java API and libhbase differentiate
   between Apache HBase tables and MapR-DB tables according to table
   names. In certain cases, such as migrating code from Apache HBase
   tables to MapR-DB tables, users need to force the API they are using to
   access a MapR-DB table, even though the table name could map to an
   Apache HBase table. The hbase.table.namespace.mappings property allows
   you to map Apache HBase table names to MapR-DB tables. This property is
   typically set in the configuration file
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-<version>/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml.

   In general, if a table name includes a slash (/), the name is assumed
   to be a path to a MapR-DB table, because slash is not a valid character
   for Apache HBase table names. In the case of "flat" table names without
   a slash, namespace conflict is possible, and you might need to use
   table mappings.

Table Mapping Naming Conventions

   A table mapping takes the form name:map , where name is the table name
   to redirect and map is the modification made to the name. The value in
   name can be a literal string or contain the * wildcard. When mapping a
   name with a wild card, the mapping is treated as a directory. Requests
   to tables with names that match the wild card are sent to the directory
   in the mapping.

   When mapping a name that is a literal string, you can choose from two
   different behaviors:
     * End the mapping with a slash to indicate that this mapping is to a
       directory. For example, the mapping mytable1:/user/aaa/ sends
       requests for table mytable1 to the full path /user/aaa/mytable1.
     * End the mapping without a slash, which creates an alias and treats
       the mapping as a full path. For example, the mapping
       mytable1:/user/aaa sends requests for table mytable1 to the full
       path /user/aaa.

Mappings and Table Listing Behaviors

   When you use the list command without specifying a directory, the
   command's behavior depends on two factors:
     * Whether a table mapping exists
     * Whether Apache HBase is installed and running

   Here are three different scenarios and the resulting list command
   behavior for each.
     * There is a table mapping for *, as in *:/tables. In this case, the
       list command lists the tables in the mapped directory.
     * There is no mapping for *, and Apache HBase is installed and
       running. In this case, the list command lists the HBase tables.
     * There is no mapping for *, and Apache HBase is not installed or is
       not running.
          + For HBase 0.98.12, the shell will try to connect to an HBase
            cluster but it will return an error instead.
          + For HBase 1.1 or above, if the mapr.hbase.default.db property
            in the hbase-site.xml is set to hbase, the list command will
            return an error stating that HBase is not available. If the
            mapr.hbase.default.db property is set to maprdb, list command
            will list the MapR-DB tables under the user's home directory.

Example 1: Map all HBase tables to MapR-DB tables in a directory

   In this example, any flat table name foo is treated as a MapR-DB table
   in the directory /tables_dir/foo.
<property>
        <name>hbase.table.namespace.mappings</name>
        <value>*:/tables_dir</value>
        </property>

Example 2: Map specific Apache HBase tables to specific MapR-DB tables

   In this example, the Apache HBase table name mytable1 is treated as a
   MapR-DB table at /user/aaa/mytable1. The Apache Hbase table name
   mytable2 is treated as a MapR-DB table at /user/bbb/mytable2. All other
   Apache HBase table names are treated as stock Apache HBase tables.
<property>
        <name>hbase.table.namespace.mappings</name>
        <value>mytable1:/user/aaa/,mytable2:/user/bbb/</value>
        </property>

Example 3: Combination of specific table names and wildcards

   Mappings are evaluated in order. In this example, the flat table name
   mytable1 is treated as a MapR-DB table at /user/aaa/mytable1. The flat
   table name mytable2 is treated as a MapR-DB table at
   /user/bbb/mytable2. Any other flat table name foo is treated as a
   MapR-DB table at /tables_dir/foo.
<property>
        <name>hbase.table.namespace.mappings</name>
        <value>mytable1:/user/aaa/,mytable2:/user/bbb/,*:/tables_dir</value>
        </property>
