Pre-Upgrade Steps for Livy

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Livy with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Stop the Livy service if it is installed:
maprcli node services -name livy -action stop -nodes <ip_address>

   If you made configuration changes that you want to carry over to the
   next version, you need to back up configuration files. Typically, the
   following configuration files contain changes:
     * /opt/mapr/livy/livy-<version>/conf/livy.conf
     * /opt/mapr/livy/livy-<version>/conf/livy-env.sh

   To back up configuration files, copy the files to a location outside
   the MapR installation. After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the
   updated Livy installation using the backup.
   Note: Livy is included in the MapR MEP repositories beginning with MEP
   4.0.0. Before MEP 4.0.0, Livy was included as a package called
   mapr-hue-livy, and released only as a part of Hue. The configuration
   files for mapr-hue-livy have a different location:
     * /opt/mapr/hue-livy/hue-livy-<version>/conf/livy.conf
     * /opt/mapr/hue-livy/hue-livy-<version>/conf/livy-env.sh
