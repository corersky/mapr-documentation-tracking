Upgrading Flume

   This section describes how to upgrade Flume without the MapR Installer.
   Flume installs into separate directories named after the version, such
   as /opt/mapr/flume/flume-<version>/.
   To upgrade with the package manager, run one of the following commands:

   On RedHat and CentOS:

yum update mapr-flume

   On Ubuntu:

apt-get install mapr-flume

   On SUSE:

zypper update mapr-flume

   To apply custom configurations to the new version, migrate any custom
   configuration settings into the new default files in the conf directory
   (/opt/mapr/flume/flume-<version>/conf/). See [1]Post-Upgrade Steps for
   Flume.
