Installing New MapR Core Features

   New features, such as MapR Monitoring, may require the installation of
   additional packages after an upgrade.

   MapR Monitoring
          MapR Monitoring, a Spyglass initiative, provides the ability to
          collect, store, and view metrics and logs for nodes, services,
          and jobs/applications. You can only install MapR Monitoring
          after you upgrade ecosystem components.

          + To install MapR Monitoring without the MapR Installer, see
            [1]Step 8: Install Metrics Monitoring and [2]Step 9: Install
            Log Monitoring.
          + To install MapR Monitoring with the MapR Installer, launch the
            MapR Installer URL ( https://<hostname/IPaddress>:9443) and
            select the Incremental Install option. With the incremental
            installation option, you can install new packages and also
            install MapR Monitoring.
