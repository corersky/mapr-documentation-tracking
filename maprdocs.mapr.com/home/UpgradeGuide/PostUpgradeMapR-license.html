Step 3: Manually Update your License

   The Base License may need be updated manually depending on the MapR
   version you are upgrading from.

   Depending on which MapR release you are upgrading from, the Base
   License may be updated. This is due to new license categories
   implemented as of MapR version 5.1. This applies to all upgrade methods
   (MapR Installer, rolling upgrade, or manual rolling upgrade).
   To update the Base License, copy the new Base License file from the
   /opt/mapr/conf.new/ directory to the /opt/mapr/conf/ directory on every
   node in your cluster.
cp /opt/mapr/conf.new/BaseLicense.txt /opt/mapr/conf/

   Note: The BaseLicense.txt file must be copied before starting warden,
   otherwise, warden must be restarted.

   If you are upgrading from the Enterprise Database Edition (M7) to the
   Converged Enterprise Edition and want to utilize the MapR-ES module,
   you must purchase additional licensing. In this case, you will be
   issued a new license to apply. See [1]Managing Licenses for more
   information. In addition, the new MapR-ES feature must be manually
   enabled.
