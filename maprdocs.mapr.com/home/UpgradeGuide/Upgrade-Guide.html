Upgrading MapR Core

   Describes the process of upgrading MapR Core.
   Upgrading MapR Core typically includes upgrading:
     * MapR Core
     * Ecosystem Components
     * MapR Client

   Upgrading MapR Core means you will need to upgrade to a MapR Expansion
   Pack (MEP). Upgrading to MapR 6.0 or later requires you to upgrade to
   MEP 4.0.0 or later before you can enable MapR 6.x features.

   The steps for upgrading a MEP are in another section of this guide
   because MEPs can be upgraded independently of the MapR Core version.
   The following procedures prompt you when it is necessary to plan for or
   upgrade a MEP.

   Upgrading MapR Core consists of the following steps:
    1. Planning the Upgrade – Determine the upgrade method, when to
       upgrade, and whether ecosystem components or MapR clients need to
       be upgraded along with MapR core.
    2. Preparing to Upgrade – Prepare the cluster for upgrade while it is
       still operational. This includes pre-upgrade steps for MapR core
       and ecosystem components.
    3. Upgrading the Cluster
          + Upgrading with the MapR Installer - Use a web interface that
            automates the upgrade of MapR core and ecosystem components.
          + Upgrading without the MapR Installer - Perform steps to
            upgrade MapR core and manually upgrade each ecosystem
            component.
    4. Finishing the Upgrade -Complete the post-upgrade steps for MapR
       core and any ecosystem components that you upgraded.
    5. Upgrading MapR Clients – Perform steps to upgrade the MapR client.

   Note: In this document, the existing version refers to the MapR version
   that you are upgrading from and the new version refers to the MapR
   version that you are upgrading to.
