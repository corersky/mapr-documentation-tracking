Pre-Upgrade Steps for Flume

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Flume with or without
   the MapR Installer.

   You need to back up configuration files for Flume if you made
   configuration changes that you want to carry over to the next version.
    1. Locate configuration files in
       /opt/mapr/flume/flume-<version>/conf/.
    2. Copy the configuration files to a location outside the MapR
       installation directory.
       After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the updated Flume using
       the backup.
