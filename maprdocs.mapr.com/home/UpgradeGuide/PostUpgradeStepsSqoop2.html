Post-Upgrade Steps for Sqoop2

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Sqoop2 with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Perform one of the following steps:
         a. Manually update the sqoop.properties file with new options. On
            each Sqoop2 server node, set the following property in
            sqoop.properties file:
org.apache.sqoop.repository.schema.immutable=false
org.apache.sqoop.connector.autoupgrade=true
org.apache.sqoop.driver.autoupgrade=true
         b. Run configure.sh -R:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
         c. Stop Sqoop2:
maprcli node services -name sqoop2 -action stop -nodes <space delimited list of
Sqoop2 server nodes>
         d. Use the upgrade utility to update the sqoop.properties file.
            On each Sqoop2 server node, run the upgrade utility.
/opt/mapr/sqoop/sqoop-<version>/bin/sqoop2-tool upgrade
            When the upgrade utility completes successfully, the following
            message displays: Tool class
            org.apache.sqoop.tools.tool.UpgradeTool has finished
            correctly.
       Note: In Sqoop 1.99.6, the sqoop.properties file is in the
       following directory: /opt/mapr/sqoop/sqoop-<version>/server/conf/.
       In Sqoop 1.99.7, the sqoop.properties file is in the following
       directory: /opt/mapr/sqoop/sqoop-<version>/conf/.
    2. Optionally, add customized properties from the sqoop.properties
       file that you saved before the upgrade to the new sqoop.properties
       file.
    3. If Sqoop is not running, start the Sqoop Server.
maprcli node services -name sqoop2 -action start -nodes <space delimited list of
 Sqoop2 server
      nodes>
