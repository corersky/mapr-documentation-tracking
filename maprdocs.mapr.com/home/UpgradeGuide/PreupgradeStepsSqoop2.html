Pre-Upgrade Steps for Sqoop2

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Sqoop2 with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Back up configuration files. Copy configuration files from
       /opt/mapr/sqoop/sqoop-<version>/server/conf/sqoop.properties to a
       location outside the MapR installation.
       For example, you can copy the file to a /tmp directory:
cp /opt/mapr/sqoop/sqoop-<version>/server/conf/sqoop.properties /tmp/
    2. Delete the Sqoop2 repository (/opt/mapr/sqoop/repository).
       Note: Due to [1]SQOOP-1593, you also should not create a backup of
       the Sqoop2 repository before you upgrade.
    3. For upgrades without the MapR Installer:Stop each Sqoop2 server
       node.
maprcli node services -name sqoop2 -action stop -nodes <space delimited list of
nodes>
