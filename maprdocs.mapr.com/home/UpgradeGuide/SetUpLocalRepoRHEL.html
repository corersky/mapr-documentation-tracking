Set Up a Local Repository: RHEL/CentOS

   To create a local repository, download your files from the Internet and
   then add the repositories to each node in the cluster.

   You create a local repository from files that you download from the
   internet, and then add the repositories to each node in the cluster.
   The files that you download differ from version to version. Using a
   maprtech.repo file, you specify URLs of the RHEL/CentOS packages. See
   the [1]Release Notes for the URLs for all release packages.
    1. Log in as root on the node or use sudo.
    2. Create the following directory if it does not exist:
       /var/www/html/yum/base
    3. On a computer that is connected to the internet, download the
       following files, substituting the appropriate <version> and
       <datestamp>:
       For example:
http://package.mapr.com/<product_package>.rpm.tgz
    4. Copy the files to /var/www/html/yum/base on the node, and extract
       them there.
       For example:
tar -xvzf <product_package>.rpm.tgz
    5. Create the base repository headers.
createrepo /var/www/html/yum/base
    6. Verify that the content of the new /var/www/html/yum/base/repodata
       directory contains filelists.xml.gz, other.xml.gz, primary.xml.gz,
       and repomd.xml.
    7. On each node, create a text file called maprtech.repo in
       /etc/yum.repos.d.
