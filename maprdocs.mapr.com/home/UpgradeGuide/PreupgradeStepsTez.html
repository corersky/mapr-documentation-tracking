Pre-Upgrade Steps for Tez

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Tez with or without the
   MapR Installer.

   Back up configuration properties files if you made configuration
   changes that you want to carry over to the next version.
    1. Locate the files in /opt/mapr/tez/tez-<version>/conf/ directory.
    2. Copy the files to a location outside the MapR installation.
       After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the updated Tez
       installation using the backup.
