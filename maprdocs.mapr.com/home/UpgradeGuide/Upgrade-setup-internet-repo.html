Using the MapR Internet Repository

   It is usually easiest to install a MapR cluster from an Internet
   repository.

   The MapR repository on the Internet provides all of the packages
   required to install a MapR cluster using native tools such as yum on
   RedHat, Oracle Linux, or CentOS, or apt-get on Ubuntu, or zypper on
   SUSE. Installing from the MapR repository is generally the easiest
   installation method, but requires the greatest amount of bandwidth.
   With this method, each node is connected to the Internet to download
   the required packages.

   When setting up a repository for the new version, leave in place the
   repository for the existing version because you might need to use it
   again.

   Prepare packages and repositories on every node, or on a single node if
   keyless SSH is set up for the root user.

   Set up repositories by completing the steps for your RedHat/Oracle
   Linux/CentOS, SUSE, or Ubuntu distribution.

   For information on repositories and packages for MapR software and
   Hadoop Ecosystem tools, see [1]MapR Repositories and Packages.

Repositories for MapR Core Software

   MapR hosts rpm and deb repositories for installing the MapR core
   software using Linux package management tools. For every release of the
   core MapR software, a repository is created for each supported
   platform.

   Platform-specific upgrade repositories are hosted at:
   [2]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v<version>/<platform>/mapr-v<versio
   n>GA-upgrade.<rpm/deb>.tgz.

Repositories for MapR Ecosystem Tools

   MapR hosts rpm and deb repositories for installing MapR ecosystem
   tools, such as Flume, Hive, Myriad, Oozie, Pig, and Sqoop. At any given
   time, the MapR recommended versions of ecosystem tools that work with
   the latest version of MapR core software are available here.

   These platform-specific repositories are hosted at the following
   locations:
     * [3]http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/<platform>
       Note: The MEP-<version> directory can be represented by a 2-digit
       number or a 3-digit number (for example, MEP-2.0 or MEP-2.0.0). See
       [4]Understanding Two-Digit and Three-Digit MEPs.
