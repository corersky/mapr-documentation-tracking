Upgrading MapR or MEP Components

   Depending on your current configuration, you may choose to upgrade the
   MapR version (MapR Core), ecosystem components, clients, or MapR
   Monitoring components.

Upgrade Paths

   To Upgrade Considerations for Upgrading See for More Information
   MapR Core MapR 3.x, 4.0.x, 4.1, and 5.x clusters can upgrade to MapR
   6.0 or later by using an offline, manual procedure. Rolling upgrades
   and upgrades to MapR 6.0 or later using the MapR Installer are
   supported only for clusters running MapR 5.2.x and MEP 3.0.1 or later.

   Ecosystem Components Beginning with MapR 5.2, you can upgrade ecosystem
   components only as part of upgrading a MapR Expansion Pack (MEP). If a
   component is supported by your current MEP, you can add the component
   at any time by using manual steps or the Incremental Install function
   of the MapR Installer.

   MapR Client MapR client is part of MapR Core. You upgrade MapR client
   nodes after you upgrade the MapR cluster nodes.

   MapR Monitoring

   MapR Monitoring components are available as part of the MapR Expansion
   Pack (MEP) that you selected for the cluster. Once MapR Monitoring is
   installed, you can upgrade MapR Monitoring components as part of the
   MEP upgrade process.
