Pre-Upgrade Steps for Spark

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Spark with or without
   the MapR Installer.

Pre-Upgrade Steps for Spark Standalone

    1. Copy configuration files from /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/conf
       to a location outside of the MapR installation directory.
       For example, if Spark SQL is configured to work with Hive, copy the
       /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/conf/hive-site.xml file to a backup
       directory.
    2. Shut down the spark-master, spark-historyserver services (if the
       spark-historyserver is running).
maprcli node services -nodes <node-ip> -name spark-master -action stop
maprcli node services -nodes <node-ip> -name spark-historyserver -action stop
    3. As the mapr user, stop the slaves:
/opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/sbin/stop-slaves.sh

Pre-Upgrade Steps for Spark on YARN

    1. Copy configuration files from /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/conf
       to a location outside of the MapR installation directory.
       For example, if Spark SQL is configured to work with Hive, copy the
       /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/conf/hive-site.xml file to a backup
       directory.
    2. Shut down the spark-historyserver services (if the
       spark-historyserver is running):
maprcli node services -nodes <node-ip> -name spark-historyserver -action stop
