Using a Local Repository

   If you install a MapR cluster from a local repository, you do not need
   an internet connection.

   You can set up a local repository on each node to provide access to
   installation packages. With this method, nodes do not require internet
   connectivity. The package manager on each node installs from packages
   in the local repository. To set up a local repository, nodes need
   access to a running web server to download the packages.

   Set up repositories by completing the steps for your RedHat/Oracle
   Linux/CentOS, SUSE, or Ubuntu distribution.

   Platform-specific upgrade repositories are hosted at:

   n>GA-upgrade.<rpm/deb>.tgz.

   For more information on repositories and packages for MapR software and
   Hadoop Ecosystem tools, see [2]MapR Repositories and Packages.
