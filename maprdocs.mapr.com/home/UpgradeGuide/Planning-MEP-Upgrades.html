Planning MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) Upgrades

   The set of Ecosystem components that you run in the cluster must all
   belong to the same MEP.

   As of MapR 5.2, you must upgrade to the MEP path. You will be offered
   packs to install that contain selected component versions. After
   upgrading, you may want to upgrade to a more recent MEP to get the
   latest patch releases or newer versions of ecosystem components.

   While each MapR core version may be supported by more than one MEP, the
   set of ecosystem components that you run in the cluster must all belong
   to the same MEP. You cannot selectively upgrade components. When you
   upgrade a MEP, all components are replaced with the versions contained
   in the newly selected MEP.

   For details on the ecosystem components available in each MEP and the
   list of MEPs supported by your MapR cluster version, see the [1]MapR
   Expansion Pack Release Notes.

   For API or behavioral changes associated with new ecosystem components,
   see the documentation for the individual component under [2]Ecosystem
   Components.
