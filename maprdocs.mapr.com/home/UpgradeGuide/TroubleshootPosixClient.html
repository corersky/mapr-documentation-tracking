Troubleshooting MapR POSIX Client Upgrades

   If you are having difficulty upgrading the MapR POSIX Client, it may be
   due to a shared memory segment lock.

   If the mapr-loopbacknfs service fails to start after an upgrade, check
   if a shared memory segment lock was the cause of the failure using this
   procedure.
    1. Open the loopbacknfs.log file. The loopbacknfs.log file is in the
       following directory: /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/logs/
    2. Check for the following string: Create/Attach to shm failed
    3. If the string exists perform the following steps:
         a. Run the following command to identify the shmid of the lock:
            ipcs -m | grep 0x0000161c
         b. Run the following command to remove the lock: ipcrm -m <shm
            id>
         c. Start the mapr-loopbacknfs service.
