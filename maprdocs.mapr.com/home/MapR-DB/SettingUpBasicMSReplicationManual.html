Setting Up Master-Slave Replication Manually

   You can run maprcli commands to set up master-slave replication
   manually.
    1. Ensure that you've followed these prerequisite steps:
          + Verify that you have complete the steps to configure the
            clusters for table replication. For more information, see
            [1]Preparing Clusters for Table Replication.
          + Run the maprcli table info command on the source table to
            verify that you have the following permissions:
               o readperm, which is required for reading from the table.
               o replperm, which is required for replicating from the
                 table.
          + Run the maprcli table info command on the destination table
            (if it already exists) to verify that you have the following
            permissions:
               o bulkload, which is required for the initial copy of
                 source data into the destination table.
               o replperm, which is required for receiving replicated
                 updates from the source table.
    2. Create the replica manually with the maprcli command table create.
       Use the -copyMetaFrom option to ensure that the metadata for the
       replica is identical to the metadata for the source table. Metadata
       includes column families, access control expressions (ACEs), and
       other attributes.
maprcli table create -path <path to the replica> -copyMetaFrom <path to the sour
ce table>
       For example, to create the replica customers in the newyork cluster
       and use the metadata from the source table in the sanfrancisco
       cluster, you could use this command:
maprcli table create -path /mapr/newyork/customers -copymetafrom /mapr/sanfranci
sco/customers
    3. Register the replica as a replica of the source table by running
       the maprcli table replica add command.
maprcli table replica add -path <path to the source table> -replica <path to the
 replica> -paused true
       For example, to register the customers table in the newyork cluster
       as a replica of the customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster,
       you could use this command:
maprcli table replica add -path /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers -replica /mapr/newy
ork/customers -paused true
       The -paused parameter ensures that replication does not start
       immediately after you register the source table as a source for
       this replica. You do this registration in step 4.
       Note: For more information about additional parameters that you can
       configure, see [2]table replica add.
    4. Verify that you specified the correct replica by running the
       maprcli table replica list command.
maprcli table replica list -path <path to the source table>
       To verify that the customers table in the newyork cluster is a
       replica of the customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster, you
       could look at the output of this command:
maprcli table replica list -path /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers
    5. Authorize replication between the tables by defining the source
       table as the upstream table for the replica by running the maprcli
       table upstream add command. Definition of the upstream table
       ensures that a table cannot replicate updates to any replica.
       Replication depends on a two-way agreement between the owners of
       the two tables.
maprcli table upstream add -path <path to the replica> -upstream <path to the so
urce table>
       To add the customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster as an
       upstream source for the customers table in the newyork cluster:
maprcli table upstream add -path /mapr/newyork/customers -upstream /mapr/sanfran
cisco/customers
    6. Verify that you specified the correct source table by running the
       maprcli table upstream list command.
maprcli table upstream list -path <path to the replica>
       To verify this in our example scenario, you could use this command:
maprcli table upstream list -path /mapr/newyork/customers
    7. If you set -paused to true when adding the replica, follow these
       steps:
         a. Load the replica with data from the source table by using the
            MapR-DB [3]CopyTable utility for binary tables or the
            [4]MapR-DB JSON CopyTable utility for JSON tables.
         b. Start replication with the command maprcli table replica
            resume. Here is the maprcli command:
maprcli table replica resume -path <path to the source table> -replica <path to
the replica>
            For our example scenario, you could use this command:
maprcli table replica resume -path mapr/sanfrancisco/customers -replica /mapr/ne
wyork/customers

     * Be aware that changes to the structure of a source table are not
       replicated automatically to replicas. For more information, see
       [5]Adding a Column Family to a Replica
     * You can check for alarms related to replication and whether
       synchronous replication is switched temporarily to asynchronous
       replication by looking in MCS. See [6]Table-Replication Alarms.
