Column Families in JSON Tables

   JSON tables store data in column families, which are collections of
   fields that are stored together on disk.

   Each table has a default column family, which is default storage for
   all fields in the documents of a table. You can create additional
   column families to store data for a collection of fields in a separate
   location on disk. Queries and other operations only on data that is
   stored in a column family are more efficient and better performing than
   queries on the same data when that data is stored with other data in a
   table. You can also cache values from a column family in memory.

   For example, suppose that you have three JSON documents in a table, and
   all three have the field a.

   not values, each document with a field named a

   At this point, you have not yet created any non-default column
   families. So, all of the data in the table resides in the default
   column family. Each JSON table is created with a default column family.

   To optimize data access for your applications, you plan to place some
   data that will be heavily queried in a new column family at path a.b,
   where b is a field that does not yet exist. Fields do not yet have to
   exist before you create column families on them.

   family will be created

   You create a column family at the path a.b and with the name CF1.

   When field b is created, that field will belong to the column family
   CF1. All values of b, as well as the values of all fields that might be
   created after b, will be stored together on disk. Applications can read
   data directly from this column family and avoid reading the rest of the
   document at the same time, making queries more efficient and therefore
   faster.

   You can create up to 64 column families in a JSON table. The column
   families can be at any location in your documents. For example, these
   two documents both use the same non-default column families at the
   paths a.b, a.b.c, and d.

   families, which are highlighted in orange, blue, and green

   If the path at which you want to create a column family already exists,
   it is recommended that the path and any fields below it contain no
   data. After the conversion of the path to a column family, it is
   possible that data existing in the path before the conversion could
   become inaccessible.

   Applications do not need to be aware of the existence of column
   families. They perform CRUD operations by using the paths of fields in
   a document. For example, to update any of the fields below a.c, an
   application does not need to be aware that the field is in the column
   family at the path a.c. The application simply moves through the
   document along the path to the field.
