Compare Operators and Comparators

   This topic describesthe compare operators and comparators for
   comparison filters.

   The comparison filters DependentColumnFilter, FamilyFilter,
   QualifierFilter, RowFilter, and ValueFilter use the following syntax:

   filter(<compareOperator>, <comparatorType:Value>)

Compare Operators

   The following compare operators are supported: <,<=, =, !=, >, >=

Comparators

   There are four comparators:
         Comparator       Description
   BinaryComparator

   This comparator lexicographically compares against the specified byte
   array .

   Values are byte arrays.

   For example, binary:abc matches values that are lexicographically
   greater than "abc”.
   BinaryPrefixComparator

   This comparator lexicographically compares against a specified byte
   array. It only compares up to the length of this byte array.

   Values are byte arrays.

   For example, binaryprefix:abc matches values in which the first 3
   characters are lexicographically equal to "abc"
   RegexStringComparator

   This comparator compares against the specified byte array using the
   given regular expression.

   You can use only the = and != compare operators with this comparator.

   Values are regular expressions.

   For example, regexstring:ab*yz matches values that begin with "ab" and
   end with "yz”.
   SubStringComparator

   This comparator tests whether the given substring appears in a
   specified byte array. The comparison is case insensitive.

   You can use only the = and != compare operators with this comparator.

   Values are strings.

   For example, substring:abc123 matches values that contains the
   substring "abc123”.
