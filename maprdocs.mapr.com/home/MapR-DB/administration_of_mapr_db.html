Administering Tables

   Administration of the MapR-DB is done primarily via the command line
   (maprcli) or with the MapR Control System (MCS). Regardless of whether
   the MapR-DB table is used for binary files or JSON documents, the same
   types of commands are used with slightly different parameter options.
   MapR-DB administration is associated with tables, columns and column
   families, and table regions.

Why use MapR-DB?

   From an administrator's point-of-view, MapR-DB provides the following
   capabilities:
     * Minimal administration: Single namespace for files, tables and
       streams, flexible schema that allows built-in data management and
       protection, automatic splits and merges as data grows and shrinks,
       and easy bulk data loading.
     * Self-healing from HW and SW failures: Replicated state and data for
       instant recovery and automated re-replication of data.
     * Global low-latency replication: Multi-master (that is, active to
       active) replication which is important for disaster recovery.
       Includes reduced risk of data loss, application failover, and
       faster data access.
     * High performance and low latency: Integrated system with fewer
       software layers, single hop to data, and no compactions with low
       I/O amplification.
     * Fine-grained security: Access permissions can be granted to tables
       (as well as files and streams) at a granular level using [1]MapR
       Access Control Expressions (ACEs), which are designed for
       flexibility and ease-of-use.

Useful Administrator Resources

   Links to Resources Descriptions

   [3]maprcli and REST API Syntax
   Command line reference for MapR operations. For MapR-DB, the commands
   particularly applicable are assocociate with the maprcli [4]table
   command. These commands include not only table CRUD operations but also
   table column family, table region, and table replication operations.
   [5]Utilities for MapR-DB JSON Tables Utilities for MapR-DB JSON tables.
   These utilities are used form managing JSON tables icluding importing
   and exporting data to and from JSON tables. Particularly useful are:
     * [6]MapR-DB JSON ImportJSON utility with imports JSON documents into
       a MapR-DB JSON table.
     * [7]MapR-DB Shell (JSON Tables)utility which performs CRUD
       operations on JSON documents and tables.

   [8]Utilities for MapR-DB Binary Tables Utilities for MapR-DB binary
   tables. These utitlies are used for managing binary tables. Particulary
   useful is [9]MapR-DB Binary CopyTable which is used to copy data from
   one MapR-DB binary table to another.
   Note: To import HFile or Result files in a MapR-DB binary table, the
   hbase command can be used. See [10]Loading Data into Binary Tables.
   [11]Configuring Security Information on security tasks for configuring
   MapR security, managing secure clusters, and administering auditing.
   [12]Hadoop and Big Data Security MapR information on Security and Big
   Data Governance that identified key unique advantages including
   authentication, authorization, auditing, and encryption.
   [13]Provisioning Secure Access Controls in MapR-DB MapR blog discussing
   MapR's boolean Access Control Expressions (ACEs) which provide
   granular-level permissions including topics and examples of best
   practices.
