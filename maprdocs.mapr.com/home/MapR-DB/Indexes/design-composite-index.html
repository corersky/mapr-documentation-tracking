Composite Indexes

   A composite index is an index that has more than one indexed field and
   zero or more included fields. Composite indexes enable you to optimize
   queries that filter and sort on multiple fields. If all fields
   referenced in a query are either indexed or included fields in a
   composite index, then you can process the query by reading only the
   index.

Sort Order

   MapR-DB sorts the composite index in the order in which you have
   defined the indexed fields. For example, if you have an index on Field1
   and Field2, MapR-DB sorts on Field1 as the primary sort key and Field2
   as the secondary.

   Each component in a composite index can have its own ordering. For
   example, you can specify an ascending sort order for one field and a
   descending sort order for another.

Composite Index Example

   Consider the following example, which illustrates the impact of key
   order in a composite index:

   In the index on the left, the prefix key is Field1. MapR-DB sorts the
   index first on Field1, and then on Field2. This aligns with the
   equality condition, Field1 = 3. MapR-DB reads the least number of
   entries from the index on the left, due to this equality condition and
   the range condition on Field2.

   In the index on the right, MapR-DB sorts the index on Field2, followed
   by Field1. In this case, the matching key values are not contiguous in
   the index, as highlighted by the entries in a lighter shade of yellow.
   MapR-DB uses the filter conditions on Field2 to start the search in the
   index. It applies the filter condition on Field1 while reading the
   index. This is less efficient because MapR-DB must read those extra
   nonmatching key values.
