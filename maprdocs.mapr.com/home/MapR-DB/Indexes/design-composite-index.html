Composite Indexes

   A composite index is an index that has more than one indexed field and
   zero or more included fields. If all fields referenced in a query are
   either indexed or included fields in a composite index, then the index
   is a covering index for that query.

Sort Order

   MapR-DB sorts the composite index in the order in which you have
   defined the keys. For example, if you have an index on fields, Field1
   and Field2, MapR-DB sorts on Field1 as the primary sort key and Field2
   as the secondary.

   Each component in a composite field index can have its own ordering.
   For example, you can specify an ascending sort order for one field and
   a descending sort for another.

Composite Index Example

   Consider this example, which illustrates the impact of key order in a
   composite index.

   In the index on the left, the prefix key is Field1. MapR-DB sorts the
   index first on Field1, and then on Field2. This aligns with the
   equality condition, Field1 = 3. MapR-DB reads the least number of
   entries from the index on the left, due to this equality condition and
   the range condition on Field2.

   In the index on the right, MapR-DB sorts the index on Field2, followed
   by Field1. In this case, the matching key values are not contiguous in
   the index, as highlighted by the entries in a lighter shade of yellow.
   MapR-DB uses the filter conditions on Field2 to start the search in the
   index. It applies the filter condition on Field1 while reading the
   index. This is less efficient because MapR-DB must read those extra
   non-matching key values.
