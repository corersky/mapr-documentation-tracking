Replication and Security

   This section describes how secondary indexes are impacted by
   replication and security.

Replication

   Secondary indexes are not replicated when tables are replicated by
   table replication (using the replication gateway). Only the JSON table
   data is replicated.

   If you intend to query destination tables and use indexes, you must
   explicitly add an index to the replica table. Replicating tables and
   adding indexes are independent of each other.

Security

   Secondary indexes reflect the access permissions of the underlying JSON
   table. Access Control Expressions (ACE) permissions are required on all
   indexed and included fields of an index before a query can use an
   index.

   To add a secondary index on a JSON table, you need the indexperm
   permission. The table owner automatically has permission, but any other
   user must be assigned indexperm permission.

   See [1]table create for information about ACE permissions and [2]table
   edit for information about table permissions.
