Simple Indexes

   A simple index is a secondary index that has only one indexed field and
   zero or more included fields. If all fields referenced in a query are
   either indexed or included fields in a simple index, then the index is
   a covering index for that query.

Sort Order

   MapR-DB sorts simple indexes on the single key field. MapR-DB sorts the
   key values in ascending order by default, unless you have specified a
   descending order when creating the index. Sorting indexes benefits
   queries with ORDER BY clauses by eliminating the need for a SORT
   operator in the query plan.

Simple Index Examples

   The following examples demonstrate the [1]cli commands to create
   various types of simple indexes. For these examples, assume you have a
   MapR-DB JSON table with the following sample data:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
       {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
       {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
       {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

                             CLI Command                             Description
maprcli table index add -path /people \
   -index emailIdx \
   -indexedfields Email

     * Creates a simple index on the Email field with no included fields
     * Allows you to filter on the Email field

maprcli table index add -path /people \
   -index dobIdx \
   -indexedfields DateOfBirth \
   -includedfields FullName

     * Creates a simple index with an included field,
     * Allows you to filter on DateOfBirth and project on FullName
       Note: You cannot use FullName as an indexed field because it
       contains nested documents. Doing so results in encoding errors when
       inserting documents into the index. See [2]Secondary Index Encoding
       Error for more information.

maprcli table index add -path /people \
   -index LastNameIdx \
   -indexedfields FullName.LastName:-1

     * Creates a simple index on the FullName.LastName subfield, as a
       descending sort key
     * Allows you to filter on FullName.LastName and sort on the subfield
       in descending order
