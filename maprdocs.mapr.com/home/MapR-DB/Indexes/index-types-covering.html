Covering Indexes

   A covering index is an index that allows MapR-DB to process a query
   using secondary indexes without reading the JSON table. Using it makes
   a query more efficient by avoiding the I/O overhead of fetching data
   from the JSON table.

   If all fields referenced in a query are either indexed or included
   fields in a secondary index, then the secondary index is a covering
   index for that query. MapR-DB determines whether an index is covering
   for a query.

   A covering index can contain only indexed fields or a combination of
   indexed and included fields. MapR-DB stores included fields in the
   index, but they do not affect the index ordering.

   While adding included fields to an index enables it to become a
   covering index, note that each field you add to an index increases its
   storage requirement. As the storage size increases, the cost of reading
   the index also increases; likewise, for the cost of adding and updating
   documents. Consider the impact on storage and updates when adding
   included fields to an index.

   In contrast to a covering index, a noncovering index is an index that
   does not store all fields referenced by a query. In this case, lookups
   occur on the JSON table to retrieve the referenced fields that are not
   available in the index itself.

   Whether an index is covering or noncovering depends on the query that
   uses the index. In the example at [1]Types of Secondary Indexes,
   zipCodeIdx is a covering index for the noted query. If the query also
   selects the Gender field, zipCodeIdx is no longer a covering index for
   the query, but it still optimizes the filter condition.
