Example of Designing Secondary Indexes

   This example illustrates the concepts behind designing your secondary
   indexes. Although this example focuses on query patterns and does not
   account for sizing, storage, and updates, you should always weigh the
   benefits of indexes against these other requirements.

   Assume that you have a MapR-DB JSON table with the following customer
   data:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
      {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
      {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
      {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

   The following table contains fields in the document that are candidates
   for indexing based on the sample queries:
   Query # Query Candidate Fields for Indexing

   1
   Find all customers who were born in the 1970s.
     * DateOfBirth

   2
   Find all customers who have an account balance greater than $10K. Order
   the information in descending order of balance.
     * AccountBalance

   3

   List customers who live in California, ordering the list by LastName,
   FirstName.

     * Address.State
     * FullName.LastName
     * FullName.FirstName

   4
   Find the ids and emails of customers who live in a specific zip code.
     * Address.Zip

   5
   Find customers who live in a specific set of states and have an account
   balance less than a specific value.
     * Address.State
     * AccountBalance

   6
   Find male customers with the last name starting with the letter "S".
     * Gender
     * FullName.LastName

   The following table contains indexes you can create to optimize the
   queries listed in the previous table and the rationale for doing so:
                                 Index                                 Rationale
   Simple index on DateOfBirth

   Optimizes the range condition on DateOfBirth in [1]query 1.

   You need not create a hashed index, because it is unlikely that the
   order of DateOfBirth correlates with the insert order of new data.
   Simple index on AccountBalance, specified as a descending key
     * Optimizes the range condition on AccountBalance in [2]query 2
     * Descending order of key meets the ordering criteria in [3]query 2
     * Also optimizes the range condition on AccountBalance in [4]query 5
       in combination with the index on Address.State

   Composite index on:
     * Address.State
     * FullName.LastName
     * FullName.FirstName

     * Optimizes both the equality condition on Address.State and ordering
       in [5]query 3
     * Inclusion of the name fields in the index meets [6]query 3 ordering
     * Also optimizes the IN condition in [7]query 5 when used in
       combination with the index on AccountBalance

   Simple index with:
     * Indexed field on Address.Zip
     * Included fields on:
          + Id
          + Email

     * Optimizes the equality condition on Address.Zip in [8]query 4
     * Adding the included fields avoids reading the JSON table in
       [9]query 4

   Composite index on:
     * Gender
     * FullName.LastName

     * Optimizes equality condition on Gender and pattern matching
       condition on FullName.LastName for [10]query 6
     * Specifying Gender as the leading key in combination with
       FullName.LastName results in more selective index lookups for
       [11]query 6
