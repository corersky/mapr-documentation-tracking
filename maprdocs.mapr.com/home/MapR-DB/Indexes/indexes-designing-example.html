Example of Designing Secondary Indexes

   This example illustrates the concepts behind designing your secondary
   indexes. The example only considers query patterns and does not account
   for sizing, storage, and updates. Always weigh the benefits of indexes
   against these other requirements.

   Assume you have a MapR-DB JSON table with the following sample data
   that contains customer information:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
      {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
      {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
      {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

   The following table contains a sample set of queries where the third
   column in the table denotes the fields in the table that are candidates
   for indexing:
   Query # Query Candidate Fields for Indexing

   1
   Find all customers who were born in the 1970â€™s.
     * DateOfBirth

   2
   Find all customers who have an account balance greater than $10K. Order
   the information in descending order of balance.
     * AccountBalance

   3

   List customers who live in California, ordering the list by LastName,
   FirstName.

     * Address.State
     * FullName.LastName
     * FullName.FirstName

   4
   Find the ids and emails of customers who live in a specific zip code
     * Address.Zip

   5
   Find customers who live in a specific set of states and have an account
   balance less than some value
     * Address.State
     * AccountBalance

   6
   Find male customers with the last name starting with the letter "S".
     * Gender
     * FullName.LastName

   The following table contains indexes you can create to optimize the
   queries listed in the previous table and the rationale for doing so:
                                 Index                                 Rationale
   Simple index on DateOfBirth

   Optimizes the range condition on DateOfBirth in [1]query 1.
   Note: When creating this index, there is no need to create a hashed
   index. It is unlikely that the order of DateOfBirth correlates with the
   insert order of new data.
   Simple index on AccountBalance, specified as a descending key
     * Optimizes the range condition on AccountBalance in [2]query 2
     * Descending order of key meets the ordering criteria in [3]query 2
     * Also optimizes the range condition on AccountBalance in [4]query 5
       in combination with the index on Address.State

   Composite index on:
     * Address.State
     * FullName.LastName
     * FullName.FirstName

     * Optimizes both the equality condition on Address.State and ordering
       in [5]query 3
     * Inclusion of the name fields in the index meets [6]query 3 ordering
     * Also optimizes the IN condition in [7]query 5 when used in
       combination with the index on AccountBalance

   Simple index with:
     * Indexed field on Address.Zip
     * Included fields on:
          + Id
          + Email

     * Optimizes equality condition on Address.Zip in [8]query 4
     * Adding the included fields avoids reading the JSON table in
       [9]query 4

   Composite index on:
     * Gender
     * FullName.LastName

     * Optimizes equality condition on Gender and pattern matching
       condition on FullName.LastName for [10]query 6
     * Specifying Gender as the leading key in combination with
       FullName.LastName results in more selective index lookups for
       [11]query 6
