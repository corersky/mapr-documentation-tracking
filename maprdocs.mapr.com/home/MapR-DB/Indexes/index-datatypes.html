Data Types Supported for Secondary Indexes

   Secondary indexes support a specific set of data types. This section
   describes how indexes behave with the supported types.

Data Types of Indexed Fields

   Indexed fields in a secondary index must contain scalar data.
   Otherwise, if the field contains an array or nested document, MapR-DB
   excludes the corresponding document from the index. The indexed field
   can be a subfield of a nested document, provided the subfield is a
   scalar type. The indexed field cannot be an array element, even if the
   array element is scalar. See the table in the Scalar Data section of
   [1]JSON Document Data Types for a list of scalar types.

   The following table summarizes what MapR-DB supports, depending on the
   characteristics of the indexed field:
   Characteristics of Indexed Field Behavior
   Field contains scalar data Supported
   Field path is a nested document subfield that contains scalar data
   Supported
   Field contains nested document data Missing in index
   Field contains array data Missing in index
   Field is an individual array element Not supported

Data Types of Included Fields

   There are no type restrictions on the included fields in an index.

Comparisons and Sorts

   Comparisons and sorts across data types differ depending on whether the
   types are comparable or noncomparable. This is not specific to
   secondary indexes. But it impacts comparisons when using secondary
   indexes and the order MapR-DB stores data in an index. See [2]Using
   Comparable JSON Document Data Types in Comparisons and Sorts and
   [3]Using Noncomparable JSON Document Data Types in Comparisons and
   Sorts to learn which types fall into each category and to understand
   their behavior.
