Viewing Secondary Index Details

   Describes how to use MCS to view more specific details on secondary
   indexes.

   You can view secondary index details using the MapR Control System.
    1. Go to the Indexes tab in the [1]table information page for the JSON
       table.
    2. Click the name of the index to display the details.
       The Details pane displays the following:

        SETTINGS
                Displays the index name, whether or not the index is
                hashed, and if hashed, the number of hashed partitions.

        FIELDS COVERED
                The fields in the JSON table that are indexed, but not
                used for ordering.

        FIELDS INDEXED
                The fields in the JSON table that are indexed and used for
                ordering.

    3. Click X to close the Details pane and return to the list of
       indexes.
