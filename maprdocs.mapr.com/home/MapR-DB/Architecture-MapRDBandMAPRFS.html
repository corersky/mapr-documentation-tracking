MapR-DB and MapR-FS

   This topic describes how MapR-DB tables are implemented directly in the
   MapR file system (MapR-FS) which allows MapR-DB to leverages the same
   architecture as the rest of the MapR platform which provides minimal
   additional management.
     * MapR-DB tables are created in logical units called volumes.
     * MapR-DB tables are sharded by implementing table regions (also
       called tablets)
     * Table regions are stored in abstract entities called data
       containers.
     * Data containers belong to MapR-FS volumes.

Tables and Volumes

   Because volumes are a management entity that logically organizes a
   cluster’s data, they can be used to enforce disk usage limits, set
   replication levels, define snapshots and mirrors, and establish
   ownership and accountability.

   Volumes do not have a fixed size and they do not occupy disk space
   until MapR-FS writes data to a container within the volume. A large
   volume may contain anywhere from 50-100 million containers.
   Because tables are stored in containers and implemented in volumes, the
   following capabilities can be leveraged:
     * Multi-Tenancy
     * Snapshots
     * Mirroring and Replication

Table Regions and Containers

   Each region of a table, along with its corresponding write-ahead log
   (WAL) files, b-trees, and other associated structures, is stored in one
   container. Each container (which can be from 16 to 32 GB in size) can
   store more than one region (which default in size to 4096 MB). The
   recommended practice is to use the default size for region and allow
   them to be split automatically. Massive regions can affect
   synchronization of containers and load balancing across a cluster.
   Smaller regions spread data better across more nodes.
   Note: Since a container always belongs to exactly one volume, that
   container’s replicas all belong to the same volume as well.
   The following are important advantages to storing table regions in
   containers:
     * Cluster Scalability
     * High Data Availability

   For more information about containers, see [1]Containers and the CLDB.

Advantages of MapR-DB Architecture

   The advantages of implementing MapR-DB directly in MapR-FS include:
     * The database has no layers to pass through when performing
       operations on data because MapR-DB runs inside of the MFS process
       and the MFS process reads from and writes to disks directly.
       Note: In contrast, Apache HBase running on the Hadoop file system
       (HDFS) must communicate with the HDFS process, which in turn must
       communicate with the ext3 file system, which itself ultimately
       writes data to disks. Apache HBase is deprecated.
     * The elimination of processes such as hops, duplicate caching, and
       needless abstractions.
     * The absence of compaction delays because I/O operations on data are
       optimized.
       Note: Compaction delays arise because I/O storms occur when logged
       operations are merged with structures on disk.
