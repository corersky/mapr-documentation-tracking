Security and CDC

   Security for CDC is applied through Access Control Expressions (ACEs).
   In addition, if a secure cluster configuration is implemented, then
   additional setup may be needed depending on the configuration.

Access Control Expressions (ACEs)

   Since Change Data Capture (CDC) changed data records are propagated
   from a MapR-DB source table to a MapR-ES stream topic, the access
   control expressions (ACEs) on the source table and destination stream
   are used for establishing permissions.

   Once a MapR-ES stream is created for purposes of receiving change data
   records, it is dedicated for that sole purpose. For example, a producer
   application should not perform CRUD operations on the topics in the
   stream.

   The following permissions are applicable depending on the scenario:
     * If you are a normal user and you want to create a changelog from a
       source table and to a destination stream topic, the following
       permissions are required:
          + replperm on the source table in the source cluster
          + topicperm on the destination stream in the destination cluster
     * If you are a normal user and want to create a changelog between
       your own MapR-DB table and someone else's stream topic, you must be
       granted topicperm permissions on the destination stream.
     * If you are a normal user and want to receive or read the data in a
       stream topic, you must be granted consumeperm permission on the
       destination topic.

   Expressions

Secure Clusters

   The destination MapR-ES stream could be in same cluster as the MapR-DB
   source table or it could be on a remote MapR cluster. How the
   configuration is setup depends on the purpose for using CDC.
     * If your destination stream is on the same cluster as the source
       table and the cluster is secure, then additional configurations are
       not required.
     * If your destination stream is on a remote secure cluster, then a
       gateway and secure configuration must be setup. See [2]Table
       Replication, [3]Administering MapR Gateways, and [4]Configuring
       Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster Mirroring and Replication
