Preparing Clusters for Table Replication

   Preparing clusters for table replication includes configuring gateways
   on destination clusters, configuring the mapr-clusters.conf file on the
   source cluster, and, if the clusters are secure, setting up secure
   communications between the clusters. After you prepare the clusters for
   table replication, you can setup replication between tables.

Before You Begin

   The following topics identify concepts and tasks that that you need to
   do before setting up your environment for table replication.
     * Plan which replication topology you want to use. For information
       about the various topologies, see [1]Supported replication
       topologies.
     * Ensure that your user ID has the readAce permission on the volume
       where the source tables are located and the writeAce permission on
       the volumes where the replicas are located. For information about
       how to set permissions on volumes, see [2]Setting Whole Volume ACEs
     * Ensure that you have administrative authority on the clusters that
       you plan to use.
     * If you upgraded your source cluster from a previous version of
       MapR, enable table replication by running this maprcli command:
       maprcli cluster feature enable -name mfs.feature.db.repl.support
     * Depending on your use case, replication requires the installation
       of gateways and may also require the HBase client. For more
       information about installation requirements, see [3]Service Layout
       Guidelines for Replication

Setting Up Table Replication

   The following steps show how to set up your environment for table
   replication including setup for secure clusters.
    1. In the mapr-clusters.conf file on every node in your source
       cluster, add an entry that lists the CLDB nodes that are in the
       destination cluster. This step is required so that the source
       cluster can communicate directly with the destination cluster's
       CLDB nodes. See the topic "[4]mapr-clusters.conf‚Äù for the format to
       use for the entries.
    2. On the destination cluster, configure gateways through which the
       source cluster will send updates to the destination cluster. See
       [5]Configuring Gateways for Table and Stream Replication.
    3. If your clusters are secure, configure each cluster so that you can
       access them all from one cluster. This way, you need not log into
       each secure cluster separately and run maprcli commands locally on
       them. See [6]Configuring Secure Clusters for Running Commands
       Remotely for more information.
    4. If your clusters are secure, add a cross-cluster ticket to the
       source cluster, so that it can replicate data to the destination
       cluster. See [7]Configuring Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster
       Mirroring and Replication.
    5. Optional: If your clusters are secure, configure your source
       cluster so that you can use the MapR Control System (MCS) to set up
       and administer table replication from the source to the destination
       cluster.
       These steps make it convenient to use MCS for setting up and
       managing replication involving two secure clusters. However, before
       following them, perform these prerequisite tasks.
       Note:
          + Ensure that both clusters are managed by the same team or
            group. The UIDs and GIDs of the users that are able to log in
            to MCS on the source cluster must exactly match their UIDs and
            GIDs on the destination cluster. This restriction applies only
            to access to both clusters through MCS, and does not apply to
            access to both clusters through the maprcli. If the clusters
            are managed by different teams or groups, use the maprcli
            instead of MCS to set up and manage table replication
            involving two secure clusters.
          + Ensure that the proper file-system and table permissions are
            in place on both clusters. Otherwise, any user who can log
            into MCS and has the same UID or GID on the destination
            cluster will be able to set up replication either from the
            source cluster to the destination cluster or vice versa. A
            user could create one or more tables on the destination
            cluster, enable replication to them from the source cluster,
            load the new tables with data from the source cluster, and
            start replication. A user could also create tables on the
            source cluster, enable replication to them from tables in the
            destination cluster, load the new tables with data from the
            destination cluster, and start replication.
         a. On the source cluster, generate a service ticket by using the
            maprlogin command:
maprlogin generateticket -type service -cluster <destination cluster>
-user mapr -duration <duration> -out <output folder>
            Where -duration is the length of time before the ticket
            expires. You can specify the value in either of these formats:
               o [Days:]Hours:Minutes
               o Seconds
         b. To every node of the source cluster, add the service ticket to
            the file /opt/mapr/conf/mapruserticket file that was created
            when you secured the source cluster:
at <path and filename of the service ticket> >> /opt/mapr/conf/mapruserticket
         c. Restart the webserver by running the maprcli node services
            command. For the syntax of this command, see [8]node services.
         d. Add the following two properties to the core-site.xml file.
            For Hadoop 2.7.0, edit the file
            /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml.
<property>
      <name>hadoop.proxyuser.mapr.hosts</name>
      <value>*</value>
 </property>
 <property>
      <name>hadoop.proxyuser.mapr.groups</name>
      <value>*</value>
 </property>
