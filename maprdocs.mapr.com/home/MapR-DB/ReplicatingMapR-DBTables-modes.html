Modes of replication

   You can replicate table data in one of two replication modes. You
   specify the mode per source-replica pair.

Asynchronous replication

   In this replication mode, MapR-DB confirms to client applications that
   operations are complete after the operations are performed on source
   tables. Updates are replicated in the background. Therefore, the
   latency of updates from client applications is not affected by the time
   required for the network roundtrip between the source cluster and the
   destination cluster.

   This type of replication is well-suited for clusters that are
   geographically separated in wide-area networks.

   MapR-DB can throttle the replication stream to minimize the impact of
   the replication process on incoming operations during periods of heavy
   load. Throttling distributes disk reads and CPU usage more evenly over
   time, so that incoming operations on a source table can be completed
   faster. Throttling is disabled by default.

   Asynchronous replication is the default replication mode.

Synchronous replication

   In this replication mode, MapR-DB confirms to client applications that
   changes have been applied to a source table only when these two
   conditions are true:
     * The change was sent to all of the container copies in the local
       cluster.
     * The change was sent to a gateway in the destination cluster. This
       operation takes place only after the first. Puts are not sent to
       gateways until after they are sent to all container copies in the
       cluster where the source table is located.

   If a gateway fails, the source detects this and resends operations to
   the gateway when it is restarted or a new gateway is brought online.

   Because of the confirmations that MapR-DB receives on source clusters,
   synchronous replication is especially well-suited for creating a backup
   of your data for disaster recovery.

   When the latency of a replication stream is high, MapR-DB switches to
   asynchronous replication temporarily so that client applications are
   not blocked indefinitely. After the latency is sufficiently reduced,
   MapR-DB switches back to synchronous replication. The same switching
   occurs when a gateway fails, and MapR-DB does not resume synchronous
   replication until a new gateway is established or the failed gateway is
   restarted.
