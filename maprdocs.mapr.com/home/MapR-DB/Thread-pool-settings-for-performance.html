Thread-pool Settings for Performance

   The MapR-DB C APIs internally have one thread pool per client. Threads
   work on the async tasks enqueued by a client application. There are two
   thread-pool parameters that you can modify in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/dbclient.conf file for better application performance.

fs.mapr.pool.threads

   This parameter controls the number of connections that a client
   application makes with MapR-DB for append, increment, read, and scan
   requests. For a higher rate of throughput to MapR-DB, you can increase
   this value. The default value is 10.

fs.mapr.highpri.pool.threads

   This parameter controls the number of threads that invoke
   application-provided callbacks. If an application's callbacks are not
   lightweight but instead perform complex calculations that require
   significant processing, increase this value to avoid delays in invoking
   callbacks. The default value is 2.
