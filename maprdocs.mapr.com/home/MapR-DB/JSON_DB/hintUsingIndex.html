Forcing Secondary Index Usage in OJAI

   In an OJAI application, you can set a query option to force the MapR
   client to use a particular secondary index to process the query. You
   can also use the option to force the client to avoid using indexes for
   the query.

   To force the MapR client to use an index, set the
   ojai.mapr.query.hint-using-index query option, passing in the name of
   the index as the second parameter:
     * [1]Java

query.setOption("ojai.mapr.query.hint-using-index", indexName);

   Regardless of cost considerations, the MapR client attempts to use the
   specified index. To use the index, the index must benefit filter
   conditions, the order by, or projections in the query as described at
   [2]Queries that Benefit from Secondary Indexes. Otherwise, the MapR
   client ignores the option.

   To force the MapR client to not use any indexes, specify the table name
   without the full path as the second parameter in the calls shown
   earlier. For example, if the full path of your table is
   /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer, pass the name customer as the
   second parameter.
   Note: Setting this option in your OJAI application has no effect if you
   are using either the OJAI Distributed Query Service or Drill.
