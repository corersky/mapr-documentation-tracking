Permissions on Arrays

   Permissions apply to an entire array, not to individual elements in an
   array. However, it is possible to set permissions on subfields within
   nested documents that are stored in an array.

   For example, granting a user read permission on array a[] in this
   document permits the user to read all of the elements in the array. It
   is not possible to grant read permission on an individual array element
   like a[1].
{"a" : [ "b", 1, "c", 2 ] }

   However, suppose you have the following document with a person array
   field that has the following nested documents:
{
    "_id" : "id001",
    "person" : [
        {"name" : {"last" : "Smith", "first" : "John"}},
        {"name" : {"last" : "Subramanium", "first" : "Ananya"}}
    ]
}

   If you grant a user read permission on the array person[], that user
   can read every field in every document within the array.

   If you want to restrict read access to only specific fields in the
   nested document, perform the following sequence of steps:
    1. Deny the user read permission on the array person[].
    2. Grant the user traverse permission on the array person[].
    3. Grant the user read permission on the specific fields. For example,
       to grant the user read permission on only the first names in the
       nested documents, grant this permission on person[].name.first.

   If you grant permissions on person[].name.first, and a document has a
   field person with a single nested document (rather than an array of
   nested documents), then any permissions granted on person[].name.first
   do not apply. You must grant separate permissions on person.name.first
   to enforce permissions on the single nested document.
