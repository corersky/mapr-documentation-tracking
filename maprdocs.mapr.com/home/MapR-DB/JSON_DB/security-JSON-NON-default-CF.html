Permissions on Non-default Column Families

   If a JSON document field is not in the MapR-DB JSON default column
   family, the field that you want to perform operations on inherits
   permissions from it's parent field must have the operation both
   readperm and writeperm permissions are required.
   Note: Non-default column families are an advanced feature of MapR-DB's
   native JSON support. For information about them, see [1]Managing Column
   Families.

   The following diagram shows an JSON document where fields b and c are
   in a column family cf1 that is defined at field b with the path a.b.

You need read and write permissions on field c,

   To perform both read and write operations on field c when it is in the
   default column family, you must have both readperm and writeperm access
   on field c.
     * If you have readperm and writeperm permissions on field b, then you
       have access to field c. You do not need any further permissions.
       Field c inherits your readperm and writeperm permissions from field
       b.
     * If you do not have readperm and writeperm permissions on field b:
          + You must have traverseperm permission granted to you on field
            b.
          + You must have readperm and writeperm permission must be
            explicitly granted to you on field c.

   A maprcli table cf colperm set commands similar to the following can be
   used to grant permissions:
maprcli table cf edit
  -path <path to JSON table>
  -cfname cf1
  -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table>
  -cfname cf1
  -name a.b.c
  -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
  -writeperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

You need read or write permissions on field c

   To perform either read or write operations on field c when it is in the
   default column family, you must have the same permission (readperm or
   writeperm) access on field c.
     * If you have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on field b,
       then you have access to field c. You do not need any further
       permissions. Field c inherits your readperm or writeperm permission
       from field b.
     * If you do not have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on
       field b:
          + You must have traverseperm permission granted to you on field
            b.
          + You must have the readperm or writeperm permission explicitly
            granted to you on field c.

   Example commands to grant these permissions:
maprcli table cf edit -path <path to JSON table> -cfname cf1
              -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
              maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table> -cfname cf
1
              -name a.b.c -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
