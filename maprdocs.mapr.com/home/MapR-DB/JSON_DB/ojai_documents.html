JSON Documents

   A JSON document is a tree of fields. Each field has a name, type, and
   value. In the case of an array type, the array field name and array
   index identify individual elements in the array. Field names are
   strings. The root of each document is a map.

   For example, an online retailer of sports equipment might have this
   JSON document for storing data about a set of bicycle pedals:
{
    "_id" : "2DT3201",
    "product_ID" : "2DT3201",
    "name" : " Allegro SPD-SL 6800",
    "brand" : "Careen",
    "category" : "Pedals",
    "type" : "Components",
    "price" : 112.99,
    "features" : [
        "Low-profile design",
        "Floating SH11 cleats included"
    ],
    "specifications" : {
        "weight_per_pair" : "260g",
        "color" : "black"
    }
}

Data Types

   MapR-DB JSON documents support a richer set of data types beyond what
   JSON supports. JSON documents can have scalar data, nested documents,
   and arrays. MapR-DB JSON stores the data in a format that maintains the
   types. To access JSON documents, you can use the OJAI API. The API
   exposes data types in a manner specific to the programming language of
   the API. [1]JSON Document Data Types describes each category of types
   in relation to the sample JSON document shown earlier.

Comparing and Sorting Data Types

   Comparisons and sorts of data types differ depending on whether the
   types are comparable or non-comparable. See [2]Comparable JSON Document
   Data Types and [3]Non-Comparable JSON Document Data Types to learn
   which types fall into each category and to understand their behavior.

Schema Flexibility

   The structure of each document, called the document's schema, is easy
   to change. Simply add new fields. For example, if the online retailer
   wants to allow customers to review products, it is simple to add the
   reviews to any document for a product.

   In this example, highlighted in bold, the comments are added as an
   array with two nested documents:
{
    "_id" : "2DT3201",
    "product_ID" : "2DT3201",
    "name" : " Allegro SPD-SL 6800",
    "brand" : "Careen",
    "category" : "Pedals",
    "type" : "Components",
    "price" : 112.99,
    "features" : [
        "Low-profile design",
        "Floating SH11 cleats included"
    ],
    "specifications" : {
        "weight_per_pair" : "260g",
        "color" : "black"
    },
    "comments" : [
        {
            "username" : "hlmencken",
            "comment" : "Best money I ever spent!"
        },
        {
            "username" : "vwoolf",
            "comment" : "What hlmencken said!"
        }
    ]
}

Identifying Document Fields

   To learn about how to access JSON document fields, see [4]JSON Document
   Field Paths. The material includes examples that use the JSON document
   shown earlier.

Querying Document Fields

   MapR-DB allows you to specify query conditions in a JSON format using
   syntax supported by the OJAI API. See [5]OJAI Query Condition Syntax
   for details.

JSON Document Size

   The default maximum size of a JSON document is 32 MB. This size
   includes the field values in the document, as well as the names, types,
   and other field metadata. You can configure this size by running the
   command described at [6]Configuring Maximum Row Sizes Using the CLI.

Tools for Working with JSON Documents

   These are the tools you can use to create, read, update, and delete
   JSON documents in MapR-DB:

   MapR-DB shell
          This shell is a light-weight tool for administering,
          manipulating, and querying JSON tables and documents. Learn more
          about it at [7]MapR-DB Shell (JSON Tables).

   OJAI API
          The OJAI API provides an interface for creating, reading,
          updating, and deleting JSON documents. [8]Querying with OJAI
          introduces you to how to query JSON documents.

          MapR-DB JSON supports the OJAI API in Java. See [9]Java OJAI
          Client API for the complete API.

   MapR-DB JSON REST API
          The REST API allows you to use HTTP calls to perform basic
          operations on MapR-DB JSON tables. Learn more about it at
          [10]Using the MapR-DB JSON REST API.
