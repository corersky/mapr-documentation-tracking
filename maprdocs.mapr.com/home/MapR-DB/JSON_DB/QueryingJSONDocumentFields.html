OJAI Query Condition Syntax

   OJAI defines a syntax for specifying query conditions. This topic
   describes the supported operators and provides examples of query
   conditions.

   When writing an OJAI application, you can also apply query conditions
   by calling OJAI API methods, corresponding to specific operators. This
   section does not discuss this alternative. For details, see [1]Query
   Conditions in OJAI Applications.
