Security on JSON Tables

   By using access-control expressions (ACEs), you can grant or deny
   access to fields and column families that are in

   For an explanation of the syntax of ACEs, see [1]ACE Syntax.
   There are three types of permission:
     * Traverse (traverseperm)
     * Read (readperm)
     * Write (writeperm)

Traverse (traverseperm)

   This permission allows the grantee to descend a hierarchy of fields to
   access the fields that the grantee has write or read permission on.

   For example, suppose that a user has read and write access only on
   field b in this document.

   To access field b, the user would need to be able to traverse (pass
   through) field a. In this case, because the entire document is in the
   default column family, the user could be granted traverse permission on
   the default column family. Field a would inherit the traverse
   permission.

   If traverse permission on the default column family were denied the
   user, it would not be possible for the user to access field b. Granting
   traverse permission on field a in this case would have no effect.

   In the next example, field a is a column family named cf1.

   To be able to read and write at field b, the user could be granted the
   traverse permission on the column family.

Read (readperm)

   This permission allows the grantee to read from a field.

   This permission extends to fields that are nested below the field that
   the permission was granted on. However, grantees can be explicitly
   denied the permission on any of the nested fields.

Write (writeperm)

   This permission allows the grantee to delete a field, insert a value
   into a field, or overwrite a field's value.

   As illustrated in the following two diagrams, deleting a field also
   deletes all fields that are nested within that field, even those fields
   on which the write permission is explicitly denied.
