Using Comparable JSON Document Data Types in Comparisons and Sorts

   Data types that have a well defined order amongst the types are
   comparable data types. In a filter condition, if a document's field
   value and the comparison value are of comparable types, the document
   qualifies if the condition returns true. This applies regardless of
   whether you have created secondary indexes on the comparison fields.
   Based on the above definition, numeric types are comparable. This
   includes the following types:
     * INT
     * SHORT
     * LONG
     * FLOAT
     * DOUBLE

Example

   Consider the following example where you have four documents, each with
   a field, AccountBalance. The types of the field differ, as noted in the
   table, but they are all comparable numeric types:
   Document Name AccountBalance Field Value AccountBalance Field Type
   DOCUMENT1     1900.12                    FLOAT
   DOCUMENT2     10000                      INT
   DOCUMENT3     10                         LONG
   DOCUMENT4     27.88                      DOUBLE

   If you specify a sort on the field AccountBalance, MapR-DB sorts the
   field in the following order:
   Document Name AccountBalance Field Value
   DOCUMENT3     10
   DOCUMENT4     27.88
   DOCUMENT1     1900.12
   DOCUMENT2     10000

   Secondary indexes sort and store data based on the values of the
   indexed fields. When reading through the index, MapR-DB returns the
   documents in the order of index.

   For example, suppose you have an index where AccountBalance is the
   indexed field. A query with the condition, "AccountBalance > 20",
   returns the documents in the following order if MapR-DB processes the
   query using the index:
     * DOCUMENT4
     * DOCUMENT1
     * DOCUMENT2
