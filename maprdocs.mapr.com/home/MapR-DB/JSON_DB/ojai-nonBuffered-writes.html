Enabling Buffered Writes in Java OJAI

   By default, MapR-DB JSON does not buffer writes. You can improve
   performance by enabling buffered writes in your Java OJAI application.

Description

   The buffered writes option can be set in the [1]Connection.getStore
   method. You pass the option setting through a Document object in the
   second parameter to the method. The Document object sets
   ojai.mapr.documentstore.buffer-writes to either true or false. The
   default value is false, which means that writes are not buffered.

Example Code Snippet

   The following code sample enables buffered writes:
final DocumentStore store =
    connection.getStore(
        "/demo_table",
        connection.newDocument().set("ojai.mapr.documentstore.buffer-writes", tr
ue));
