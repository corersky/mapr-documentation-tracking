Multi-Index Queries

   Indexes benefit queries with multiple filter conditions. The OJAI
   Distributed Query Service can optimize these queries by creating query
   plans that scan multiple indexes and take the intersection of the
   matching documents.

   Scanning multiple indexes is an alternative to using [1]Composite
   Indexes. The following example illustrates how the OJAI Distributed
   Query Service does this.
   Suppose you have a JSON table with an index on the Address.State field,
   another index on the Address.City field, and the query has the
   condition:
{
  "$and":[
    {"$lt":{"Address.State":"D"}},
    {"$gt":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   The OJAI Distributed Query Service creates a query plan that uses the
   indexes as follows:
     * Performs a scan on the first index using the Address.State < "D"
       condition.
     * Performs a scan on the second index using the Address.City > "Oak"
       condition.
     * Takes the intersection of the document IDs that match both
       conditions.

   If you do not apply conditions on both Address.State and Address.City
   in most of your queries, defining separate indexes instead of a single
   composite field index may be more desirable. With a composite index on
   fields Address.State and Address.City, the query service does not
   choose the index unless there is a condition on field Address.State. If
   there is a condition on Address.State, the query service can choose the
   composite index. But in order restrict the search on both fields, there
   must be an equality condition on Address.State. See [2]Equality Queries
   for further details.

   You can define separate single key indexes as well as a composite
   index, but this requires more storage and impacts performane
   throughput. See the sections on [3]storage and [4]throughput
   considerations in [5]Designing Secondary Indexes for further guidance.
   The following table illustrates the differences between using a
   composite index vs multiple indexes. The second column shows the
   behavior when you have a composite index defined on (Address.State,
   Address.City). The third column shows the behavior when you have
   separate simple indexes defined on each field.
   Filter Condition Composite Index Two Simple Indexes
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$eq":{"Address.City":"Oakland"}}
  ]
}

   Index searched using both conditions Separate index searches using each
   filter condition. Results intersected.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$ge":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Index searched using both conditions Separate index searches using each
   filter condition. Results intersected.
{"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Index searched using single filter condition Same as composite index
   case. But because the simple index has only a single indexed field, it
   is smaller and more efficient to read.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$ge":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$eq":{"Address.City":"Oakland"}}
  ]
}

   Index search initiated using only the Address.State condition.
   Address.City filter applied while reading the index. Separate index
   searches using each filter condition. Results intersected.
{"$eq":{"Address.City":"Oakland"}}

   Cannot use index Index searched using single filter condition
