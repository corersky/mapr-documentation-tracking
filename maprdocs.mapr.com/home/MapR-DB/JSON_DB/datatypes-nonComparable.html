Non-Comparable JSON Document Data Types

   Defines non-comparable JSON document data types and describes their
   behavior when used in comparisons and sorts.

   Non-comparable data types are data types that do not have a well
   defined order amongst the types. In constrast to comparisons between
   [1]comparable types, comparisons between fields and values of
   non-comparable types do not qualify even if you perceive a match in
   values. This is true whether you have indexed the field you are
   comparing or not.

   Arrays and nested documents also fall into the non-comparable category.
   They are even more restrictive about ordering. Whereas scalar types
   have a defined ordering within the type, arrays and nested documents do
   not. Because they do not have a defined ordering, only equality
   comparisons on these types are meaningful. When matching on arrays, the
   order of the array elements must match. For nested documents, all
   fields in the nested document must match but the order of the fields is
   not relevant.

Example

   Consider the following example. If your field, docField, has string
   values and you compare it against a numeric value, none of the string
   values in the field match the numeric. Likewise, if your field,
   docField, has numeric values and you compare it against a string value,
   none of the numeric values in the field match the string. Both field
   and comparison values must be strings or integers to match:
   Document Name Value of Field docField Type of Field docField Filter
   Condition Field Value Qualifies Filter Condition?
   DOCUMENT1a 23 STRING docField = 23 No
   DOCUMENT1b 23 INT docField = 23 Yes
   DOCUMENT2a 45 INT docField = '45' No
   DOCUMENT2b 45 STRING docField = '45' Yes
   DOCUMENT3 No type due to missing value docField = 23 No
   DOCUMENT4 NULL No type due to NULL value docField = '45' No

   MapR-DB does not define a fixed ordering across non-comparable types.
   It sorts the values within comparable types and within each
   non-comparable type, but not across both.

   In the previous example, when sorting on field, docField, the following
   shows a possible sort in ascending order:
   Document Name Value of Field docField    Type of Field docField
   DOCUMENT1b    23                      INT
   DOCUMENT2a    45                      INT
   DOCUMENT1a    23                      STRING
   DOCUMENT2b    45                      STRING
   DOCUMENT4     NULL                    No type due to NULL value
   DOCUMENT3                             No type due to missing value

   Note the independent ordering of the integer and string values. Also
   note that for the rows with NULL and missing field values, the row with
   NULL appears before the row with a missing value.
