Deleting JSON Tables

   This topic describes how to delete MapR-DB JSON tables using either
   programmatic APIs or dbshell.
     * [1]Java
     * [2]dbshell

   To delete a table in the Java OJAI client, call an Admin object's
   deleteTable() method and pass, as an argument, the path of the table to
   delete:
public void deleteTable(String tablePath) throws DBException {
    try (Admin admin = MapRDB.newAdmin()) {
        if (admin.tableExists(tablePath)) {
            admin.deleteTable(tablePath);
        }
    }
}

# mapr dbshell
maprdb root:> drop <table path>

   See [3]dbshell drop for additional details.

Permissions Required

   You must have both the readAce and writeAce permissions on the volumes
   where the JSON tables are located to delete it. For information about
   how to set permissions on volumes, see [4]Setting Whole Volume ACEs.
