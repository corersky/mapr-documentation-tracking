Using Indexes to Optimize Projections in Queries

   OJAI queries that do not use the OJAI Distributed Query Service can use
   indexes even when there are no filter conditions referencing the fields
   of an index. This requires a full scan of the index. But in cases where
   all fields referenced in the query are fields in an index, this
   eliminates the need to read the MapR-DB JSON table. The referenced
   fields can be either indexed fields or included fields

   The following table provides examples where MapR-DB can and cannot use
   the index for projections. Assume you have an index with the following
   fields:
     * Indexed fields - IdxField1, IdxField2
     * Included fields - Field3, Field4, Field5

   Further assume that the fields referenced in the index are a small
   subset of the total fields in the MapR-DB JSON table. With these
   assumptions, avoiding reads on the JSON table is beneficial.
   OJAI Query Elements Use of Index for Projections
     * SELECT IdxField1, Field4

   Yes

   All fields referenced are fields in index.
     * SELECT Field3, Field4

   Yes

   All fields referenced are fields in index.
     * SELECT IdxField1, Field6

   No

   Field6 not included in index.
     * SELECT IdxField1, Field3
     * WHERE condition on IdxField2

   No

   All fields referenced are fields in the index, but the index cannot be
   used with the WHERE condition.
     * SELECT IdxField1, Field3
     * WHERE condition on Field4

   No

   All fields referenced are fields in the index, but the index cannot be
   used with the WHERE condition.
     * SELECT IdxField1, Field4
     * ORDER BY on IdxField2

   No

   All fields referenced are fields in the index, but the index cannot
   optimize the ORDER BY. The query needs the OJAI Distributed Query
   Service to sort large data sets.
