Read Your Own Writes in Java OJAI

   The Java OJAI DocumentStore and Query APIs provide the ability to track
   writes to JSON tables. Use these APIs to ensure your application reads
   recent writes on JSON tables with secondary indexes.

Description

   This feature might be used when it is important for a query to reflect
   data synchronized between a JSON table and its secondary indexes. For
   example, consider the following expense tracking system:
     * You have been adding and tracking expenses for the quarter.
     * You have some last minute expenses being added to the system.
     * You have a secondary index that has a single indexed field, the
       expenses field.
     * You want to run a query that returns all of the expenses for the
       quarter including the last minute ones.

   In this case, you should use the DocumentStore and Query APIs to
   resolve stale data associated with asynchronous indexes. The APIs allow
   you to synchronize write operations on the JSON table with read
   operations on a secondary index.

API Details

   The OJAI DocumentStore and Query interfaces provide the following
   methods to support this functionality.

   DocumentStore.beginTrackingWrites
          Begins tracking the write operations performed through this
          instance of DocumentStore. The method takes an optional
          previousWritesContext parameter. If you specify this parameter,
          the tracking uses that context as the base state.

   DocumentStore.endTrackingWrites
          Flushes any buffered writes operations for this DocumentStore
          and returns a writesContext. Use this context to ensure that
          writes are visible to later queries. You can use the context
          across DocumentStore objects in the same, as well as different,
          client processes, when the stores refer to the same JSON table.
          For example, you can pass the writesContext returned by one
          DocumentStore to a second DocumentStore, to begin write tracking
          on the second store.

   DocumentStore.clearTrackedWrites
          Stops the write tracking and clears any state on this
          DocumentStore instance.

   Query.waitForTrackedWrites
          Sets the writesContext parameter for this query. A writesContext
          allows this query to "see" all the writes that happened inside
          the writesContext of a DocumentStore.

Read Your Own Writes Example

   The following code snippet demonstrates these calls. See
   [2]OJAI_013_ReadYourOwnWrite.java for the complete example.
public void updateAndQuery(Connection c, DocumentStore store) throws Exception {
    store.beginTrackingWrites();
    store.update("user0000", c.newMutation().set("salary", 114526.00));
    // more mutations, then get the commit-context
    String writesContext = store.endTrackingWrites();
    System.out.println("updated");
    Query query = c.newQuery()
        .waitForTrackedWrites(writesContext)
        .select("salary")
        .where(c.newCondition().is("salary", Op.GREATER, 100000.00).build())
        .build();
    DocumentStream stream = store.findQuery(query);
    // process query results

    store.beginTrackingWrites();

    try {
        store.update("user0000", c.newMutation().set("salary", "abcd"));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        store.clearTrackedWrites();
        throw e;
    }
}
