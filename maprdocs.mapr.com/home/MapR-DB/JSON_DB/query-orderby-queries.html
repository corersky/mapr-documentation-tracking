Using Indexes to Optimize ORDER BY Queries

   Using indexes can help you improve the performance of queries that have
   an ORDER BY clause. This includes ORDER BY clauses with either
   ascending or descending sorts, as well as more than one ordering field.
   The same index can optimize both filter conditions and the ORDER BY
   clause.

   To use the index for an ORDER BY query, the index's key list order and
   sort order must match the orderings specified in the query. If the
   index’s keys also match filter conditions in the query, using the index
   also reduces the amount of data read from the index.

Index Key List Order and Sort Order Examples

   The following table provides examples of when MapR-DB can and cannot
   use an index for ordering, based on the index key list ordering and
   sort ordering specified. Assume that you have a table that has a
   [1]composite index on fields Address.State and FullName.LastName. You
   have defined both keys in ascending order. Further assume that the
   query has an ORDER BY on the fields Address.State and
   FullName.LastName, both in ascending order:
     Ordering in Query   Use of Index for Ordering
   Address.State:ASC

   Yes
   Address.State:DESC

   No

   Sort direction does not match.
Address.State:ASC,
FullName.LastName ASC

   Yes
   FullName.LastName:ASC

   No

   Address.State must be included as a prefix in the ordering.
FullName.LastName:ASC,
Address.State:ASC

   No

   Sort directions match, but the order of fields does not match.

Filtering and ORDER BY Query Examples

   Assume that you have a [2]composite index defined with the following
   two indexed fields:
     * Address.State:ASC
     * FullName.LastName:ASC

   The following table shows examples for different filtering and ORDER BY
   scenarios using this composite index:
   Query Condition Ordering in Query Index Use
{"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

FullName.LastName:ASC

   Both filtering and ordering
{"$gt":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

Address.State:ASC

   Both filtering and ordering
{"$gt":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

Address.State:DESC

   Only filtering, because the sort direction does not match
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$ge":{"FullName.LastName":"Smith"}}
  ]
}

FullName.LastName:ASC

   Both filtering and ordering
{"$gt":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

Address.State:ASC,
FullName.LastName:ASC

   Both filtering and ordering
{"$gt":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

FullName.LastName:ASC

   Only filtering
{"$in":{"Address.State":["CA","TX"]}}

FullName.LastName:ASC

   Only filtering
{"$ge":{"FullName.LastName":"Smith"}}

Address.State:ASC,
FullName.LastName:ASC

   Only ordering, because FullName.LastName is not a prefix in the filter
   lookup

Partial Sorts with Non-Covering Indexes

   MapR-DB updates secondary indexes asynchronously, which can result in
   updates to the index lagging the parent JSON table. You can avoid this
   behavior in your Java OJAI application by setting a query option in
   your application. See [3]Avoiding Partial Sorts with Secondary Indexes
   in Java OJAI for details on how to do this.

   One consequence of this index update lag is the impact on queries that
   use [4]non-covering indexes to provide the ordering of a query. Because
   the index is not fully synchronized with its parent JSON data, data
   read through the index might be out of date.

   The following example illustrates this behavior.
     * Suppose you have a query with the following criteria:
          + Selects docField
          + Filter condition where docField >= 5
          + Order by on docField
     * You have an index where docField is an indexed field. The index
       optimizes both the filter condition and order by clause. The query
       also selects other fields, so the index is a non-covering index for
       the query.
     * When reading through the index, MapR-DB reads a document in which
       the docField value is 9. The data for that field in the JSON table
       is also 9. The data is consistent.
     * The next entry in the index has docField set to 10. This value is
       in the proper sort order relative to the previous value of 9, but
       the data in the JSON table has changed from 10 to 6. The update is
       not yet reflected in the index.
     * MapR-DB returns the value 6 (not 10), which is out of order,
       relative to data previously read from the index.

   The following table and diagram illustrates this example:
             Update State            Query Result in docField Sort Order
   Before update                     5, …, 9, 10
   JSON table updated, but not index 5, …, 9, 6
   Index updated                     5, 6, …, 9

   Note: This behavior does not occur with covering indexes. MapR-DB only
   reads from a single data source, the index, when using covering
   indexes.

   See [5]Asynchronous Secondary Index Updates for a more detailed
   discussion of asynchronous index updates.
