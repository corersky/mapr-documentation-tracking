Queries that Benefit from Secondary Indexes

   Secondary indexes benefit queries with filter conditions, ORDER BY
   clause, and projections.

   They benefit these query elements in the following ways:

   Filter Conditions
          Eliminates full table scans, reducing the number of documents
          that MapR-DB reads, if the filtering fields are keys in an
          index.

   ORDER BY Clause
          Eliminates the need to sort the data after scanning the index,
          if the index's sort order matches the query's sort order.

   Projections
          Eliminates the need to read the MapR-DB JSON table, if all
          fields referenced in the query are fields in an index.

   Note: The projections optimization is not supported for OJAI queries
   that execute through the OJAI Distributed Query Service, and SQL
   queries issued to MapR Drill. See [1]OJAI Distributed Query Service for
   details about the types of OJAI queries that use the service.

   The following topics describe the specific query types and provide
   examples.
