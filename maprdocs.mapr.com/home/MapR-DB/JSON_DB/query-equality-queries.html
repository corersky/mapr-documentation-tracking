Using Indexes to Optimize Equality Conditions

   Using indexes can help you improve the performance of queries that have
   equality conditions. You can define indexes that optimize equality
   conditions on scalar data fields.

   If the index has a single key, the condition limits the index search to
   only the keys matching the scalar value. If the index has more than one
   key and there are equality conditions on all keys, the conditions limit
   the search to the combined matching values. If there are conditions on
   a subset of fields and the most significant keys have equality
   conditions, MapR-DB limits the search to those scalar values.

   Assume that you have a MapR-DB JSON table with documents in the
   following format:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
        {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
        {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
        {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

   The examples in the following sections reference this sample JSON
   document.

Indexes on Scalar Data Fields

   The following table provides examples where MapR-DB can and cannot use
   the index with equality conditions on scalar data. The last entry in
   the table illustrates the case where you can use index to optimize an
   equality condition in combination with a range condition.
   Note: This example assumes that a [1]composite index exists on fields
   Address.State and Address.City.
   Query Condition How MapR-DB Uses the Index
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$eq":{"Address.City":"Oakland"}}
  ]
}

   Performs a lookup on the specified state and city values, and reads the
   index until the conditions no longer match.
{"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Performs a prefix lookup to find matching state values. The value of
   the Address.City field is not relevant. Continues reading from the
   index until the state field no longer matches "CA".
{
  "$and":[
    {"$in":{"Address.State":["CA","NY","MA"]}},
    {"$eq":{"Address.City":"Springfield"}}
  ]
}

   Performs the following three lookups in the index:
     * Address.State = "CA" and Address.City = "Springfield"
     * Address.State = "NY" and Address.City = "Springfield"
     * Address.State = "MA" and Address.City = "Springfield"

{"$eq":{"Address.City":"Oakland"}}

   Even if the query references the field Address.State, MapR-DB cannot
   use the index unless there is also an equality condition on the leading
   key of the index, Address.State.
{"$in":{"Address.State":["CA","NY","MA"]}}

   Performs three prefix lookups, one for each of the values in the IN
   clause.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$ge":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State = "CA" and
   Address.City = "Oak". Continues reading the index until the condition
   Address.State = "CA" no longer qualifies.
