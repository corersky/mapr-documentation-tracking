JSON Document Field Paths

   To access fields in a JSON document, you use a field path. The syntax
   for a field path can vary, depending on the data type you are
   accessing: nested documents, arrays, nested documents within arrays,
   and multidimensional arrays.

   The examples in this topic reference the following sample JSON
   document:
{
    "_id" : "2DT3201",
    "product_ID" : "2DT3201",
    "name" : " Allegro SPD-SL 6800",
    "brand" : "Careen",
    "category" : "Pedals",
    "type" : "Components",
    "price" : 112.99,
    "features" : [
        "Low-profile design",
        "Floating SH11 cleats included"
    ],
    "specifications" : {
        "weight_per_pair" : "260g",
        "color" : "black"
    },
    "comments" : [
        {
            "username" : "hlmencken",
            "comment" : "Best money I ever spent!"
        },
        {
            "username" : "vwoolf",
            "comment" : "What hlmencken said!"
        }
    ]
}

   In the simplest case, the field path is the name of the field and
   refers to the entire field.

Nested Documents

   If a field is a nested document, specifying the nested document
   identifies the entire nested document.

   To identify individual fields in a nested document, you use a dot
   notation to specify their paths. A field path is a sequence of field
   names that leads to the particular field that you are interested in.
   The names are separated by dots.

   The following shows a document with multiple levels of nested
   documents:
{
   "a" : {
       "b" : {
            "c" : {
                "d" : "value_for_d"
            }
        }
    }
}

   The field path for field d using dot notation is a.b.c.d.

   The following table shows examples of field paths using dot notation
   for the sample JSON document:
                    Field Path                  Value Returned
   specifications

{
  "specifications":
    {"color":"black","weight_per_pair":"260g"}
}

   The entire nested document field specifications
   specifications.weight_per_pair

{"specifications":{"weight_per_pair":"260g"}}

   The weight_per_pair subfield in specifications
   specifications.color

{"specifications":{"color":"black"}}

   The color subfield in specifications

Arrays

   If the field is an array, specifying the array's field name identifies
   the entire array.

   To access an element in an array, specify the position of the element
   in the array, starting at offset zero.

   The following table shows examples of field paths that reference arrays
   for the sample JSON document:
               Field Path             Value Returned
   features

{
  "features":[
    "Low-profile design",
    "Floating SH11 cleats included"
  ]
}

   The entire features array
   features[0]

{"features":["Low-profile design"]}

   The first element of the features array
   features[1]

{
  "features":
    [null,"Floating SH11 cleats included"]
}

   The second element of the features array
   Note: null is shown in the first element of the array to signify that
   the element returned is the second entry from the array.
   comments[0]

{
  "comments":
    [{"comment":"Best money I ever spent!","username":"hlmencken"}]
}

   The first element of the comments array, which is a nested document

Nested Documents Within Arrays

   Array elements can be nested documents. But, it is not possible to
   reference individual subfields across all of these nested documents.
   For example, suppose you have the following JSON documents in a MapR-DB
   table where addresses has an array of nested documents:
{
  "_id":"1",
  "addresses":[
    {"state":"CA","city":"SJ"},
    {"state":"CA","city":"SC"},
    {"state":"WA","street":"NE 39th"}
  ]
}

   You cannot reference only the nested document's state subfield across
   all elements in the addresses array. To access all the state subfields,
   you must reference the entire addresses field.

   To access a nested document within an array, specify the array element
   using its index, and then use the dot notation to specify the path to
   the desired field.

   The following table describes the field paths supported and what each
   field path returns:
                   Field Path                Value Returned
   addresses

{
  "addresses":[
    {"city":"SJ","state":"CA"},
    {"city":"SC","state":"CA"},
    {"state":"WA","street":"NE 39th"}
]}

   The addresses array
   addresses.city

{}

   Empty because addresses is not a nested document
   addresses[0]

{
  "addresses":
    [{"city":"SJ","state":"CA"}]
}

   The first nested document in the addresses array
   addresses[2].state

{
  "addresses":
    [null,null,{"state":"WA"}]
}

   The state subfield in the third nested document in the addresses array
   Note: null is shown in the first two elements of the array to signify
   that the element returned is the third entry from the array
addresses[0].state,
addresses[0].city

{"addresses":[{"city":"SJ","state":"CA"}]}

   The city and state subfields in the first nested document in the
   addresses array

Multidimensional Arrays

   Arrays can have more than one dimension.

   For example, suppose you want to store the high and low temperatures by
   week. The following document contains the high and low temperatures in
   Fahrenheit for the seven days beginning on April 29th, 2018. The
   document uses a two-dimensional array to store the high and low
   temperatures for each day. The first element of each nested array
   element is the high temperature for a day, and the second element is
   the low:
{
   "_id" : "001",
   "temps" : [[61,49],[74,51],[75,51],[74,52],[78,54],[75,53],[75,54]],
   "weekOf" : "4/29/2018"
}

   To access individual high or low temperatures by day, you specify a
   two-dimensional array element with the desired array indexes. To access
   a pair of high and low temperatures, you specify a single array index.
                     Field Path                  Value Returned
   temps[0]

   {"temps":[[61,49]]}

   temps[5][1]

{"temps":[null,null,null,null,null,[null,53]]}

   Note: null is shown for all array elements preceding the desired
   element

   There is no limit on the number of dimensions in an array.
