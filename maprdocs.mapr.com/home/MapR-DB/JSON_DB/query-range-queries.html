Range Queries

   Indexes can improve the performance of queries with range conditions.
   They can appear in combination with equality conditions when the most
   significant index keys have equality conditions.

   The following range condition operators benefit from indexes:
     * Less than (or equal to)
     * Greater than (or equal to)
     * Pattern matching operator LIKE, provided the pattern in the
       condition does not start with a wildcard character

   Note: In Drill, the LIKE operator only works on fields that have
   varchar data types. To use the LIKE operator in Drill queries, use the
   [1]CAST function to explicitly cast fields to varchar. To use indexes
   for such queries, create indexes on the cast expressions, as explained
   in [2]Using Casts in Secondary Indexes.

   The examples in this topic assume you have a MapR-DB JSON table with
   documents in the following format:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
        {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
        {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
        {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

Indexes on Scalar Data Fields

   The following table provides examples where MapR-DB can and cannot use
   the index with range conditions on scalar data. Assume that a
   [3]composite index exists on the Address.State and Address.City fields.
   To use both indexed fields in the composite index, you must have an
   equality condition on Address.State.
   Filter Condition How MapR-DB Uses the Index
{"$le":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Reads from the beginning of the index up to and including the condition
   Address.State <= "CA".
{"$gt":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State > "CA"
   through the end of the index.
{"$like":{"Address.State":"C%"}}

   Performs a simple prefix match starting at the condition Address.State
   >= "C". Continues reading the index until the filter no longer
   qualifies.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$ge":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State = "CA" and
   Address.City >= "Oak". Continues reading from the index until the
   condition Address.State = "CA" no longer qualifies.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$in":{"Address.State":["CA","NY","MA"]}},
    {"$gt":{"Address.City":"Spring"}}
  ]
}

   Performs these three lookups and reads through the index:
     * Address.State = "CA" and Address.City > "Spring"
     * Address.State = "NY" and Address.City > "Spring"
     * Address.State = "MA" and Address.City > "Spring"

{
  "$and":[
    {"$gt":{"Address.State":"C"}},
    {"$gt":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State > "C"
   through the end of the index. Although Address.City is part of the
   index key, MapR-DB does not use Address.City > "Oak" when initiating
   the index search. Applies that filter while reading the index.
{"$le":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}

   Even if the query references the field Address.State elsewhere in the
   query, MapR-DB cannot use the index because there is no equality
   condition on the prefix key of the index, Address.State.
