Deleting Column Families

   You can delete a column family (except for the default column family)
   in a JSON table with the Admin.deleteFamily() Java method.
   Important: Starting in the 6.0 release, you cannot delete a column
   family from a JSON table.

Permissions Required

   The readAce and writeAce permissions on the volumes where the JSON
   tables are located. For information about how to set permissions on
   volumes, see [1]Setting Whole Volume ACEs.

Behavior

   The data that is in the specified column family is deleted. If the
   column family is followed by one or more column families in a
   hierarchy, the other column families in the hierarchy are unaffected
   and still accessible. For example, if column family CF1 at path a.c is
   followed by column family CF2 at path a.c.f, CF2 remains accessible and
   only the data in CF1 is deleted.
   Before deleting the column family CF1 at a.c After deleting the column
   family CF1 at a.c
{
 "a" : {
         "b" : "value_b",
         "c" : {
                 "d" : "value_d",
                 "e" : "value_e",
                 "f" : {
                         "g" : "value_g",
                         "h" : "value_h"
                       }
                }
       }
}

{
 "a" : {
         "b" : "value_b",
         "c" : {
                 "d" : "",
                 "e" : "",
                 "f" : {
                         "g" : "value_g",
                         "h" : "value_h"
                       }
                }
       }
}

Example of using the Admin.deleteFamily() method

public void deleteColumnFamily(String tablePath, String familyName) throws DBExc
eption {
    try (Admin admin = MapRDB.newAdmin()) {
      if (admin.tableExists(tablePath)) {
        admin.deleteFamily(tablePath, familyName);
      }
    }
}

   Parameter Description
   tablePath The path of the table in the MapR file system. See the "Table
   Paths" section in [2]MapR-DB JSON Tables.
   familyName The name of the column family to delete. You cannot delete
   the default column family. If familyName is equal to "default", the API
   returns an exception.
