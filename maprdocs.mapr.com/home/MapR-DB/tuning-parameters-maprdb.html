Tuning Parameters for Client Apps

   Though tuning client applications is generally not necessary, MapR does
   offer tuning parameters to change the behavior of client-side caching.

   Client application cache pending puts in buffers that are unique to
   each tablet (region, in HBase terminology). Individual put buffers are
   flushed when they are full or idle. As a result of this architecture
   and behavior, client applications tend to send RPCs of 128KB when
   flushing puts to disk, which results in better performance than
   flushing a single global buffer would, as that could result in a large
   number of small RPCs.

   You can change the values of parameters that affect how put buffers are
   flushed. Set values for them in the hbase-site.xml file or
   core-site.xml file in your MapR installation. If a non-default value
   for a parameter is set in both files, the value in the hbase-site.xml
   file is used.

   db.mapr.putbuffer.threshold.mb
          Specifies the size of the cumulative put buffer for all tablets
          in the client application. When this threshold is reached, the
          put buffer that is most full is flushed to its tablet.

          The default value is 32MB.

          Increasing this value can improve performance when an
          application performs operations on very large tables or on a
          very large number of tables.

   db.mapr.putbuffer.threshold.sec
          Specifies the number of seconds that MapR-DB should wait before
          flushing an idle put buffer.

          The default value is 3.

          This parameter has no effect if automatic flushing is enabled.

   fs.mapr.tabletlru.size.kb
          Specifies the size of the metadata cache for all tables in a
          client application..

          The metadata for each tablet is 128 bytes.

          The default value of this parameter is 512KB, which allows for
          the caching of the metadata of 4,096 tablets.

          When this metadata cache is full, any operation on a tablet for
          which the metadata is not cached requires an RPC to fetch that
          tablet's metadata. Moreover, caching the newly retrieved
          metadata removes from the cache the metadata of a different
          tablet.

          Increasing this value can improve performance when an
          application performs operations on very large tables or on a
          very large number of tables.

   fs.mapr.threads
          Specifies the number of threads to use when flushing put
          buffers. Each thread makes synchronous RPCs when flushing.

          The default value is 64.
