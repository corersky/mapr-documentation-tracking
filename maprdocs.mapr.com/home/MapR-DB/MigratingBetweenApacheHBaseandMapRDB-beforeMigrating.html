Before You Start

   Before migrating your tables to another platform, consider the
   following points:
     * Schema Changes. Apache HBase and MapR-DB binary tables have
       different limits on the number of column families. When you are
       migrating to MapR-DB binary tables, you may be interested in
       changing your table's schema to take advantage of the increased
       availability of column families.
     * API Mappings: When you are migrating from Apache HBase to MapR-DB
       tables, examine your current HBase applications to verify the APIs
       and HBase Shell commands used are fully supported.
     * Namespace Mapping: If the migration will take place over a period
       of time, be sure to plan your table namespace mappings in advance
       to ease the transition. See [1]Mapping to HBase Table Namespaces
       for more information.
     * Implementation Limitations: MapR-DB binary tables do not support
       HBase coprocessors. If your existing Apache HBase installation uses
       coprocessors, plan any necessary modifications in advance. MapR-DB
       binary tables support a subset of the regular expressions supported
       in Apache HBase. Check your existing workflow and HBase
       applications to verify you are not using unsupported regular
       expressions.

   When migrating to MapR-DB binary tables, change your Apache HBase
   client to the MapR client by installing the version of the mapr-hbase
   package that matches the version of Apache HBase on your source
   cluster.

   See [2]Installing MapR Software for information about MapR installation
   procedures, including setting up the proper repositories.
