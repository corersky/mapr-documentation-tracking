Security and Replication

   Security is configured at all locations in the replication stream.

On clusters

   You can replicate between clusters that are all secure. See
   [1]Configuring Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster Mirroring and
   Replication for more information about replication between secure
   clusters.

At source tables

   The -replperm parameter lets you specify an access control expression
   (ACE) to declare who has permission to replicate data from a table.
   This parameter is available in the maprcli table create and maprcli
   table edit commands.

Across a network

   You can send data encrypted or unencrypted when replicating between
   secure clusters by using the -networkencryption parameter when adding a
   replica to a source table.

At gateways

   Gateways ensure that replicas receive updates only from source tables
   that are designated as upstream sources.

   Moreover, gateways handle authentication with secure destination
   clusters.

At replicas

   Because of the several upstream security checks, no parameters are
   needed for setting ACEs to declare who has permission to update a
   replica through a replication stream. However, before replication
   begins, replicas can be loaded with a snapshot of the data in
   corresponding source tables. Permission to perform such a load is
   controlled by the ACE that you set in the -bulkloadperm parameter for a
   replica. You can set the ACE with either the maprcli table create or
   maprcli table edit command.

   All other ACEs defined for a replica still apply for local updates and
   reads.
