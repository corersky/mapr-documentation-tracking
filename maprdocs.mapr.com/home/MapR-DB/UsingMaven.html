Compiling and Running MapR-DB Binary Applications

   For applications that use the MapR-DB Java API for binary tables, use
   Maven to compile and determine the application's dependencies. Then,
   when you run the application, specify those dependencies in the
   application's classpath.

Compile and Determine Dependencies

    1. Add MapR's maven repository to the list of repositories in your
       application's pom.xml, if it is not there already:
<repository>
      <id>mapr-releases</id>
      <url>http://repository.mapr.com/maven/</url>
      <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
      <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
</repository>
    2. Add a dependency to the HBase client project:
<dependencies>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.hbase</groupId>
  <artifactId>hbase-client</artifactId>
  <version><version selected from the repository></version>
</dependency>
<dependencies>

       Note:
          + The hbase-client version mentioned above is an example. The
            actual version that your application requires is based on the
            current MEP and MapR version that you are running.The file
            versions are listed in the following location:
            [1]http://repository.mapr.com/nexus/content/groups/mapr-public
            /org/apache/hbase/hbase-client/ Ensure that the version tags
            include reference to m7-<maprversion>. Otherwise, your
            applications will not be able to access MapR-DB binary tables.
          + If your application uses both the MapR-DB JSON and MapR-DB
            Binary APIs, you may encounter a conflict in the netty library
            used by each API. To avoid this, exclude the netty library
            from your hbase-client dependency as follows:
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.hbase</groupId>
   <artifactId>hbase-client</artifactId>
   <version><version selected from the repository></version>
   <exclusions>
     <exclusion>
        <artifactId>netty-all</artifactId>
           <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
     </exclusion>
   </exclusions>
</dependency>
    3. Use Maven to compile the application and resolve dependencies. For
       example, you can run mvn clean package.

Running Applications

   When you develop a Java application, you can use a dependency
   management tool such as Maven to compile your application. However, it
   is recommended that do the following instead:
    1. Compile the Java application without including dependencies
    2. Specify the required classpath when you submit the application to
       the cluster

   If you choose to bundle the JAR file, and there is a mismatch between
   the bundled JAR file and the version that your MapR cluster expects,
   this can result in failures. The failures differ depending on the
   version of MapR you are using. For more information, see [2]Using the
   MapR-FS JAR to Connect to the Cluster.

   If the cluster is secure, the node must also have a mapr ticket
   configured for the user that runs the application.
   You can use the following command to launch MapR-DB binary
   applications:
java -cp <classpath>:. -Djava.library.path=/opt/mapr/lib <main class JAR> <comma
nd line arguments>

   Note: The classpath should include items that are part of the 'hbase
   classpath' script plus any other required dependencies.
