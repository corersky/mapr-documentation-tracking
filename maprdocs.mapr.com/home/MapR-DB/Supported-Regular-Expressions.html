HBase Java Regular Expressions Support

   This topics defines the subset of Java regular expressions that are
   supported for MapR-DB tables.

   Filters used with Scan operations support regular expressions. When you
   filter scans on MapR-DB tables, you can use regular expressions that
   comprise the [1]Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions library, as well as
   a subset of the regular expressions that are supported in
   java.util.regex.pattern.
