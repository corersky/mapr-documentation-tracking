Decommissioning Apache HBase Nodes

   To decommission nodes running Apache HBase, follow these steps for each
   node:
    1. From the HBase shell, disable the Region Load Balancer by setting
       the value of balance_switch to false:
hbase(main):001:0> balance_switch false
    2. Leave the HBase shell by typing exit.
    3. Run the graceful stop script to stop the HBase RegionServer:
       Warning: The graceful_stop.sh script does not look up the hostname
       for an IP number. Do not pass an IP number to the script. Check the
       list of RegionServers in the Apache HBase Master UI to determine
       the hostname for the node being decommissioned.
[user@host] ./bin/graceful_stop.sh <hostname>
