connection.h

   libMapRClient also includes a function in the connection.h header file:
   hb_connection_create_as_user(). This function provides support for
   impersonation, so that you can connect to a MapR cluster and access
   MapR-DB tables by using a specific username.

   The user that is passed with the hb_connection_create_as_user() API
   must have permissions on the tables that the application accesses. For
   example, to read from a table, the user must have the readperm
   permission. To write to a table, the user must have the writeperm
   permission. See [1]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.

   For hb_connection_create() and hb_connection_create_as_user(), the
   standard C APIs for HBase require a list of ZooKeeper nodes. For
   MapR-DB, this list is interpreted as a list of CLDB nodes. The zk_root
   parameter is ignored. If zk_quorum is NULL, then the connection will be
   created to the default cluster that is listed in the mapr-clusters.conf
   file.

   The following is the full connection.h file for the libMaprClient
   library.
