Impersonation Example

   This sample application demonstrates the capabilities of the new C API
   for impersonation.

   The sample also shows how to use the API in your own programs. The
   application is located in the /opt/mapr/examples/interactive directory.

Prerequisite for compiling and running this sample application

   Install the mapr-client package on the node where you will build the
   application. See [1]Installing the MapR Client. If the mapr-core
   package is already installed, you do not need to install the
   mapr-client package.

Compiling this sample application

   To compile and run this sample application, set the
   MAPR_IMPERSONATION_ENABLED environment variable to true and then read
   the instructions in the README file in the
   /opt/mapr/examples/interactive directory.

   Though the application links against libjvm, a Java virtual machine
   (JVM) is not spawned. However, the libMapRClient does have Java
   dependencies.
