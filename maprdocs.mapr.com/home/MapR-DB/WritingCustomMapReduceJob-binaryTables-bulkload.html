Performing Bulkloads with MapReduce

   This section describes custom MapReduce applications used to perform
   bulkloads for MapR-DB binary tables.

   You can use the [1]HFileOutputFormat configureIncrementalLoad() method
   for writing custom MapReduce applications to perform bulk loads.
   Although the name of the method implies that you can use it only for
   incremental bulk loads, the method also works for full bulk loads,
   provided that the -bulkload, BULKLOAD, or Bulkload parameter for a
   table is set to true, as described in [2]Bulk Loading and MapR-DB
   Tables.

   If you have a custom MapReduce applications that does not use
   HFileOutputFormat.configureIncrementalLoad(), simply use the path to
   the MapR-DB table that you want to load. Using
   HFileOutputFormat.configureIncrementalLoad() provides at least two
   advantages:
   This method performs a number of tasks that your application would
   otherwise need to do explicitly:
    1. Inspects the table to configure a total order partitioner
    2. Uploads the partitions file to the cluster and adds it to the
       DistributedCache
    3. Sets the number of reduce tasks to match the current number of
       regions
    4. Sets the output key/value class to match HFileOutputFormat's
       requirements
    5. Sets the reducer up to perform the appropriate sorting (either
       KeyValueSortReducer or PutSortReducer)

   This method turns off Speculative Execution automatically. For details,
   see the note below.
   Warning: Turning off Speculative Execution

   Speculative Execution of MapReduce tasks is on by default. For custom
   applications that load MapR-DB binary tables, it is recommended to turn
   Speculative Execution off. When it is on, the tasks that import data
   might run multiple times. Multiple tasks for an incremental bulkload
   could insert one or more versions of a record into a table. Multiple
   tasks for a full bulkload could cause loss of data if the source data
   continues to be updated during the load.

   If your custom MapReduce application uses
   HFileOutputFormat.configureIncrementalLoad(), you do not have to turn
   off Speculative Execution manually.
   HFileOutputFormat.configureIncrementalLoad() turns it off
   automatically. Speculative Execution is automatically turned off for
   MapReduce utilities such as CopyTable and ImportTsv.

   If you are writing a custom MapReduce application that does not use the
   HFileOutputFormat configureIncrementalLoad() method for bulk loading,
   you must turn off Speculative Execution manually.

   Turn off Speculative Execution by setting the following MapReduce
   version 2 parameter to false: mapreduce.map.speculative

   If the job is programmatically written, you can turn off Speculative
   Execution at the code level: job.setSpeculativeExecution(false);
