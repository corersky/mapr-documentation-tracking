Loading Data into Binary Tables

   Bulkload operations can be performed as a full bulkload or as an
   incremental bulkload.

   The most common way of loading data into a MapR-DB Binary Tables is
   with a put operation. However, at large scales, bulk loads offer a
   performance advantage over put operations.

   Bulk loading is supported by the following tools, which can be used for
   both full and incremental bulkload operations:
     * MapR's hbase [1]MapR-DB Binary CopyTable utility which copies
       MapR-DB binary table data, table metadata, access control
       expressions, and more to another MapR-DB binary table.
hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.CopyTable
     * MapR's hbase ImportFiles utility which imports HFile or Result
       files into MapR-DB binary tables. For example:
hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.ImportFiles
   -Dmapred.reduce.tasks=2
   -inputDir < input directory, for example: /test/tabler.kv >
   -table < table name, for example: /table2 >
   [ -format < Result|HFile > ]
   [ -sample < true|false > ]
   [ -mapOnly < true|false > ]

Full Bulk Loads

   Full bulkload operations offer the best performance advantage because
   it skips the write-ahead log (WAL) typical of MapR-DB binary table
   operations. Full bulkload operations can only be performed on empty
   tables that have the bulkload attribute set to true. This value is set
   only when creating a table.

   When you set the bulkload attribute, you cannot enable replication on
   the table. Since this effectively disables logging on the table,
   MapR-DB also does not capture log data that Elasticsearch can use to
   index the table.
   Important: Tables are unavailable for normal client operations,
   including put, get, and scan operations, while a full bulkload
   operation is in progress.

   To create a MapR-DB binary table for bulkloading, use one of the
   following:
     * MapR [2]maprcli table create command with tthe -bulkload parameter
       set to true.
     * Apache HBase shell create command with the BULKLOAD parameter set
       to true. For example:
hbase> create '/a0','f1', BULKLOAD => 'true'
       If you want to pre-split a table, separate the BULKLOAD parameter
       from the SPLITS parameter. For example:
hbase> create '/t1', 'f1', {SPLITS => ['10', '20', '30']}, {BULKLOAD => 'true'}

     * MapR Control System (MCS) with Will table be bulkload? option set
       to Yes under table PROPERTIES.

   Note: Attempting a full bulkload on a table that does not have the
   bulkload attribute set to true results in an incremental bulkload being
   performed instead.
   After you perform a full bulkload on a table, you cannot perform a full
   bulkload on it again. For example:
     * You cannot use the MapR maprcli table edit command to set the
       bulkload parameter to TRUE again.
     * You cannot use the Apache HBase shell alter command to set the
       BULKLOAD parameter to TRUE again.
     * In MCS, the Will table be bulkload? option cannot be modified after
       table creation.

Incremental Bulk Loads

   Incremental bulk loads can add data to existing tables concurrently
   with other table operations, with better performance than put
   operations. This type of bulk load makes use of write-ahead log files.
   Note: Tables are available for client operations, such as put, get, and
   scan operations, during incremental bulk loads.

   You can use incremental bulk loads to ingest large amounts of data to
   an existing table. Tables remain available for standard client
   operations such as put, get, and scan while the bulk load is in
   process. A table can perform multiple incremental bulk load operations
   simultaneously.
   Note: Whether you create a table with the maprcli table create command,
   with the hbase shellâ€™s create command, or in MCS, incremental loads are
   supported by default.
