Using Custom Authentication

   This section describes how to use Hadoop pseudo authentication for
   custom authentication.
   Editing the hbase-site.xml file is the procedure to follow if you want
   to use Hadoop pseudo authentication. Alternatively, you can write and
   use your own authenticator to substitute for the "simple" configuration
   by implementing the Hadoop AuthenticationHandler interface. If you are
   using custom authentication, place your authenticator jar in the
   following directory:
/opt/mapr/hbase/hbase-<hbase_version>/lib/

   Then start the REST Gateway.
