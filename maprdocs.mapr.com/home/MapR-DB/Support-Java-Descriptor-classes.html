HColumnDescriptor and HTableDescriptor Support

   This section describes the supported fields in the HColumnDescriptor
   and the HTableDescriptor classes.

   MapR-DB supports all of the methods that are in these classes. However,
   it supports only a subset of their fields.

HColumnDescriptor Class

      Field                            Description
   BLOCKSIZE    Size of blocks in files stored to the filesytem (hfiles).
   BLOOMFILTER  Whether or not to use bloomfilters.
   COMPRESSION  Compression type.
   IN_MEMORY    Whether to serve from memory or not.
   MIN_VERSIONS Minimum number of versions to keep.
   NAME         Name of the column family.
   TTL          Time to live of cell contents.
   VERSIONS     Number of versions to keep.

HTableDescriptor Class

   Field Description
   AUTOSPLIT

   Specifies whether to split the table into regions automatically as the
   table grows. The average size of each region is determined by
   theregionsizemb parameter.

   The default value is true.
   BULKLOAD Boolean. Specifies whether to perform a full bulk load of the
   table. The default is false. For more information, see [1]Bulk Loading
   and MapR Tables.
   DELETE_TTL

   Used for multi-master replication.

   Normally, delete operations are purged after the affected table cells
   are updated. Whereas the result of an update is saved in a table until
   another change overwrites or deletes it, the result of a delete is not
   saved. In multi-master replication, this difference can lead to tables
   being unsynchronized.

   Example

   Suppose that you have set up multi-master replication between table
   customers in the cluster sanfrancisco and table customers in the
   cluster newyork. Client applications then make these two changes:
    1. On /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers, put row A at 10:00:00 AM.
    2. On /mapr/newyork/customers, delete row A at 10:00:01 AM.

   On /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers, the order of operations is:
    1. Put row A with a timestamp of 10:00:00 AM
    2. Delete row A with a timestamp of 10:00:01 AM (This operation is
       repllicated from /mapr/newyork/customers.)

   On /mapr/newyork/customers, the order of operations is:
    1. Delete row A with a timestamp of 10:00:01 AM
    2. Put row A with a timestamp of 10:00:00 AM (This operation is
       replicated from /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers.)

   Now, though the put happened on /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers at
   10:00:00 AM, the put reaches /mapr/newyork/customers several seconds
   after that. Suppose that the actual time that the put arrives at
   /mapr/newyork/customers is 10:00:03 AM.

   To ensure that both tables stay synchronized, /mapr/newyork/customers
   should preserve the delete until after the put is replicated. Then, the
   delete can be applied after the put. Therefore, the time-to-live for
   the delete should be at least long enough for the put to arrive at
   /mapr/newyork/customers. In this case, the time-to-live should be at
   least 3 seconds.

   In general, the time-to-live for deletes should be greater than the
   amount of time that it takes replicated operations to reach replicas.
   By default, the value is 24 hours.

   For example, suppose (to extend the scenario above) that you pause
   replication during weekdays and resume it on weekends. The put takes
   place on Monday morning /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers at 10:00:00 AM and
   the delete takes place at /mapr/newyork/customers at 10:00:01 AM.
   Replication does not resume until 12:00:00 AM Saturday morning. Given
   the volume of operations to be replicated and the potential for network
   problems, it is possible that these operations will not be replicated
   until Sunday. In this scenario, a value of 7 days for DELETE_TTL (7
   multiplied by 24 hours) should provide sufficient margin.
   NAME Name of the table.
