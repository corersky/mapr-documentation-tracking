Cluster Scalability

   Information about and location of tables (and files) is not tracked
   directly, but through MapR-FS containers by the CLDB. Because this
   architecture keeps the CLDB size small, it becomes practical to store
   10s of exabytes in a MapR cluster, regardless of the number of tables
   and files.

   The location of containers in a cluster is tracked by that cluster's
   container location database (CLDB). CLDBs are updated only when a
   container is moved, a node fails, or as a result of periodic block
   change reports. The update rate, even for very large clusters, is
   therefore relatively low. MapR-FS does not have to query the CLDB
   often, so it can cache container locations for very long times.

   Moreover, CLDBs are very small in comparison to Apache Hadoop
   namenodes. Namenodes track metadata and block information for all
   files, and they track locations for all blocks in every file. Because
   blocks are typically 200 MB or less in size, the total number of
   objects that a namenode tracks is very large. CLDBs, however, track
   containers, which are much larger objects, so the size of the location
   information can be 100 to 1000 times smaller than the location
   information in a namenode. CLDBs also do not track information about
   tables and files.
