Using the Hbase Browser

   When you open the Hbase Browser, you can view the all the directories
   and MapR-DB binary tables available in the MapR-FS. You can use the
   HBase Browser to create, edit, and search for MapR-DB binary tables.
   However, you cannot enable, disable, or drop MapR-DB binary tables.
   Note: The browser also lists MapR-DB JSON tables. However, their
   appearance is not different from that of MapR-DB binary tables. You
   cannot edit JSON tables.
