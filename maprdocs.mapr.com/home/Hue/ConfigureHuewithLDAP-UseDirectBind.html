Using Direct Bind

   To use the direct bind method for LDAP authentication, edit these
   parameters in the ldap section of the hue.ini file:
    1. Set search_bind_authentication=false.
    2. If you are using the Active Directory directory service, uncomment
       the line with the nt_domain parameter. Change the value from
       nt_domain=mycompany.com to the NT domain you want to connect to.
    3. If you are using any other directory service, uncomment the line
       with ldap_username_pattern and specify the format, such as the one
       shown here: Note that <username> will be replaced by the
       information provided on the Hue login page.
ldap_username_pattern="cn=<username>,dc=example,dc=com"
    4. Restart Hue once all configuration changes have been made so the
       changes will take effect.
