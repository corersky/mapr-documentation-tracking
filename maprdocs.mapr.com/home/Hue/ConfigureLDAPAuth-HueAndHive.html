Configure LDAP Authentication Between Hue and Hive

   You can configure Hue to use LDAP Authentication when it communicates
   with HiveServer2. Before you configure Hue to use LDAP authentication
   with HiveServer2, verify that HiveServer2 is configured to use LDAP
   authentication. For more information, see [1]Configure HiveServer2 to
   use LDAP Authentication with OpenLDAP.

   Complete the following steps to configure LDAP authentication between
   Hue and Hive:
    1. Configure Hue to connect to Hive with LDAP authentication:
         a. Configure the [beeswax] section of the hue.ini: set mechanism
            option.
         b. For Hue 3.10 or later, set the auth_username and auth_password
            options in the [desktop] or [beeswax] sections of hue.ini; for
            Hue 3.9, set the ldap_username and ldap_password options in
            the [desktop] section.
       The following examples summarize these changes:
       Example for Hue 3.10
[desktop]
  ...
  # Default LDAP/PAM/.. username and password of the hue user used for authentic
ations with other services.
  # e.g. LDAP pass-through authentication for HiveServer2 or Impala. Apps can ov
erride them individually.
  auth_username=sampleuser
  auth_password=123456
  ...
[beeswax]
  ...
  # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
  mechanism=LDAP

       Example for Hue 3.9
[desktop]
  ...
  # LDAP username and password of the hue user used for LDAP authentications.
  # Set it to use LDAP Authentication with HiveServer2 and Impala.
  ldap_username=sampleuser
  ldap_password=123456
  ...
[beeswax]
  ...
  # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
  mechanism=LDAP

    2. Optional: Configure Hue to authenticate users through LDAP. See
       [2]Configure Hue with LDAP.
    3. Restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <space delimited list of
nodes>
