Configure Separate Hive Data and Metadata Directories for Hue

   If you want to store Hue data and metadata in separate directories from
   Hive data and metadata, follow these steps:
    1. Copy hive-site.xml to a new location. (The original hive-site.xml
       file remains in the previous location for use by Hive.)
    2. Edit hue.ini and change the hive_conf_dir property so it points to
       the new location for hive-site.xml.
    3. Change the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property in the new
       hive-site.xml file so it points to the directory where Hue data
       will be located.
    4. Change the hive.metastore.uris property so it points to the
       directory for Hue's metastore_db.
    5. Set the hive.metastore.execute.setugi property to true.
<property>
  <name>hive.metastore.execute.setugi</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description> Set this property to enable Hive Metastore service impersonation
 in non-secure mode.
   In non-secure mode, setting this property to true causes the metastore to exe
cute DFS operations
   using the client's reported user and group permissions. Note that this proper
ty must be set on
   BOTH the client and server sides. </description>
