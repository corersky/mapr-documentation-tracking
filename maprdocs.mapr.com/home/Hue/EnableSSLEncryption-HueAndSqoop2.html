Enable SSL Encryption Between Hue and Sqoop2

   The following procedure explains how to enable SSL encryption between
   Hue and Sqoop2.
    1. Configure Sqoop2 to use SSL, or verify that Sqoop2 is configured to
       use SSL. For details, see "Enabling SSL Encryption in Sqoop2."
    2. In the hue.ini file:
         a. Add the following entry under the [desktop] section:
ssl_cacerts=<directory_path_to_cert.pem>/cert.pem
         b. Add the following entry under the [sqoop] section:
server_url=https://<host>:12000/sqoop
            The following example hue.ini file summarizes the changes. You
            can use this example as a template:
….
[desktop]
….
# Path to default Certificate Authority certificates.
 ssl_cacerts=/opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.10.0/cert.pem
….
[sqoop]
  # For autocompletion, fill out the librdbms section.

  # Sqoop server URL
  server_url=https://ubuntu500:12000/sqoop

    3. Restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <ip_address>
