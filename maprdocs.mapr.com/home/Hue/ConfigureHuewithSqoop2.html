Configure Hue with Sqoop2

   Hue's Sqoop Transfer application is used to import data from MySQL to
   MapR-FS and to export data from MapR-FS to MySQL. Before you can run
   the Sqoop Transfer application, you need to:
     * Install the Sqoop2 server and Sqoop2 client packages. For more
       information, see the [1]Installing MapR and/or MapR Ecosystem
       Components.
     * Edit the hue.ini file to configure Hue with Sqoop2.
     * You can configure Hue to use Kerberos with Sqoop2. For more
       information, see [2]Configure Kerberos Between Hue and Sqoop2.

   Warning:

   To disable the Sqoop2 application, see [3]Disabling an Application.
