Integrate Hue with Impala

   Hueâ€™s Impala application supports interactive SQL and HiveQL queries
   from within your browser. Hue provides additional functionality with
   Impala that is not available from the command line such as
   parameterized queries, syntax highlighting, and saving queries.

   For information about installing Impala, see [1]Installing Impala.
   Warning: To disable the Impala application, see [2]Disabling an
   Application.

   To configure Hue to work with Impala, edit the impala section of the
   hue.ini file and change parameter values as necessary. The next section
   shows the default version of the Impala settings in hue.ini. For
   instructions on how to change Impala settings, see [3]Modifying the
   hue.ini File.
