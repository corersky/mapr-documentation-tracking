Integrate Hue with Hive

   Complete the following steps to integrate Hue with Hive:
    1. Edit the hue.ini file. Complete the following steps in the beeswax
       section of the hue.ini file:
         a. Configure the hive_server_host and hive_server_port
            properties. This step is not required on a single node
            cluster.
[beeswax]

# Host where HiveServer2 is running.
# If Kerberos security is enabled, use fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).
  hive_server_host=<FQDN of Hive Server>

# Port that HiveServer2 Thrift server runs on.
  hive_server_port=10000
         b. Verify that the path specified in the hive_conf_dir property
            applies to the Hive version that you have installed. If
            needed, update the path to reflect the Hive version that you
            have installed.
# Hive configuration directory, where hive-site.xml is located
hive_conf_dir=/opt/mapr/hive/hive-1.0/conf
            If Hue and Hive are installed on separate nodes, you must also
            copy the Hive conf directory to the Hue node.
    2. Configure Data and Metadata Directories. When Hue and Hive are used
       together, they are usually configured to share metadata and data
       directories. However, you can create create separate directories
       for Hue and Hive.
       The locations of the shared directories are specified by the
       following properties in the hive-site.xml file:
          + hive.metastore.uris (the hostname and port of the Hive
            Metastore node)
          + hive.metastore.warehouse.dir (the directory where the default
            database for the warehouse is located)
       See [1]Configure Shared Hive Data and Metadata Directories for Hue
       and [2]Configure Separate Hive Data and Metadata Directories for
       Hue for more information.
    3. Perform any additional Hue configurations and then restart Hue so
       that the changes will take effect. See [3]Starting the Hue
       Webserver.
