Configure the Hue Database

   The Hue server stores user-account information, the job submission
   history, and Hive queries in one of the following supported databases:
     * SQLite, the embedded Hue database (the default database)
     * MySQL
     * PostgreSQL
     * Oracle
     * MariaDB

   Note: MapR does not recommend the use of SQLite.
