Configure Hue Interface Authentication

   You can configure the following user authentication methods for the Hue
   interface:
   Authentication Method Description
   Hue User Administration Use the Hue interface to create and manage user
   accounts for each Hue user.
   LDAP Import LDAP users into Hue and then use LDAP to authenticate users
   with their LDAP credentials. For more information, see [1]Configure Hue
   with LDAP.
   PAM

   Use multiple PAM modules to authenticate users. PAM authentication is
   configured by default. When you use this method, you cannot edit users
   in the Hue interface.
