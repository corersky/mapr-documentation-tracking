Using Bind Credentials (Search and Bind)

   To use the search and bind method for LDAP authentication, edit these
   parameters in the ldap section of the hue.ini file:
    1. Set search_bind_authentication=true.
    2. In the Authentication backend section, add the following line after
       the ##backend= statement: Hue searches base_dn for an entry with
       user_name_attr that contains the user name provided on the Hue
       login page.
backend=desktop.auth.backend.LdapBackend
    3. Restart Hue once all configuration changes have been made so the
       changes will take effect.
