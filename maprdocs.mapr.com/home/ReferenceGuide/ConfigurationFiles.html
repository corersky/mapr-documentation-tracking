Configuration Files

   This section contains reference information about various configuration
   files.

Configuration File Permissions

   Files located in /opt/mapr/hadoop-2.x.x/etc/hadoop are owned by the
   root user account. To edit these files, you must be logged in as root
   user.

Automatic Rolloff of Old Configuration Files

   Whenever you run configure.sh, the current warden.conf,
   mapr-clusters.conf, hibernate.cfg.xml, and db.conf configuration files
   are saved with the current timestamp appended to the name. They are
   saved to the following directory:
/opt/mapr/conf/conf.old

   These configuration files are saved for backup purposes.
