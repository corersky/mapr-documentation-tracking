stream info

   Displays the values of the parameters of the specified stream.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce on the volume
     * [2]lookupdir on directories in the path
     *

        adminperm
                When a user with this permission runs the command, the
                output includes the access-control expressions for the
                adminperm and topicperm permissions.

        produceperm, consumeperm, or topicperm
                When a user with one of these permissions runs the
                command, the output does not include any access-control
                expressions.

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.
