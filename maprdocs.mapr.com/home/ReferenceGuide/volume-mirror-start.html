     * Permissions required: fc or restore on the volume

   When a mirror is started, the mirror volume is synchronized from a
   hidden internal snapshot so that the mirroring process is not affected
   by any concurrent changes to the source volume. The volume mirror start
   command does not wait for mirror completion, but returns immediately.
   The changes to the mirror volume occur atomically at the end of the
   mirroring process; deltas transmitted from the source volume do not
   appear until mirroring is complete.

   To provide rollback capability for the mirror volume, the mirroring
   process creates a snapshot of the mirror volume before starting the
   mirror, with the following naming format:
   <volume>.mirrorsnap.<date>.<time>.

   Normally, the mirroring operation transfers only deltas from the last
   successful mirror. Under certain conditions (mirroring a volume
   repaired by fsck, for example), the source and mirror volumes can
   become out of sync. In such cases, it is impossible to transfer deltas,
   because the state is not the same for both volumes. Use the -full
   option to force the mirroring operation to transfer all data to bring
   the volumes back in sync.
