Elasticsearch Formatting Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_ELASTICSEARCH_EXCP

   Meaning
          The put of primary table cannot be converted/formatted for
          pushing to ElasticSearch. If the primary table has ElasticSearch
          as one of its replicas, that may miss updates on some rows as
          they could not be converted to a supported format for
          ElasticSearch.

   Resolution
          Check for rows that could not be formatted for pushing to
          ElasticSearch in MFS logs and insert row with data that can be
          pushed to ElasticSearch.
