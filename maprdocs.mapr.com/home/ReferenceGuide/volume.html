volume

   Manages volumes, snapshots and mirrors.

Fields

   The following table lists the data fields that provide information
   about each volume. Each field has two names:
     * Field name - displayed in the output of the volume list command and
       used to specify the columns displayed using the columns parameter
     * Short name - used to specify the columns displayed using the
       columns parameter

   The short name is also used when specifying rows with a filter, for
   example when specifying a set of volumes about which to get
   information.
   accesstime va A value that can be used to determine when this volume
   was accessed.
   actualreplication arf The actual current replication factor by
   percentage of the volume, as a zero-based array of integers from 0 to
   100. For each position in the array, the value is the percentage of the
   volume that is replicated index number of times. Example: arf=5,10,85
   means that 5% is not replicated, 10% is replicated once, 85% is
   replicated twice.
   advisoryquota aqt The advisory quota for the volume, in MB. A value of
   0 indicates there are no soft or advisory quotas for this volume.
   AdvisoryQuotaExceededAlarm aqa Alarm raised if the volume size is more
   than the value configured for the advisory quota.
   aename aen The accountable entity name.
   aetype aet The type of accounting entity. Value can be:
     * 0 - user
     * 1 - group

   allowGrant ag Specifies whether a parent volume grants permission for a
   child volume to inherit its properties. Value can be true or false.
   AlmostFullTopologyAlarm afta Timestamp when [1]Topology Almost Full
   alarm was raised.
   audited ea Indicates whether 1 or not (0) auditing is enabled for the
   volume. See [2]Enabling Auditing for the steps to enable auditing on a
   volume and on directories, files, and tables in that volume.
   auditVolume av Indicates whether (1) or not volume accommodates audit
   logs.
   CannotMirrorAlarm cma Timestamp when "Cannot Mirror" alarm was raised.
   coalesceInterval ci The interval of time in minutes during which only
   the first instance of an operation on a node is recorded in audit logs,
   if auditing is enabled. Subsequent identical operations performed on
   the same node are ignored during the interval. Setting this field to a
   larger number helps prevent audit logs from growing quickly.
   Note: The default value is 60 minutes.
   containerAllocationFactor Indicates the number of containers created
   for the volume.
   ContainersNonLocalAlarm cnla Timestamp when the [3]Local Volume
   containers non-local alarm was raised.
   creationTime ct The volume creation time (epoch time in seconds). This
   is only available on volumes created using MapR v6.0.0 or later. For
   volumes created using older MapR versions, the [4]volume info and
   [5]volume list commands will return empty value for this field.
   creator on Name of the user that created the volume.
   creatorcontainerid ccid ID for the container.
   creatorvolumeuuid cvid ID that supports the container chain
   identification for mirroring. The creatorcontainerid and
   creatorvolumeuuid fields combined form a unique identifier for the
   container chain.
   criticalReReplTimeOutSec The timeout (in seconds) before re-replicating
   critically under-replicated containers only.
   DataUnavailableAlarm dua Timestamp when [6]Data Unavailable alarm was
   raised.
   DataUnderReplicatedAlarm rfa Timestamp when [7]Data
   Under-Replicatedalarm was raised.
   dbindexlagsecalarmthresh dilsat Defines the lag time in seconds for
   updating secondary indexes after which the [8]Secondary Index Encoding
   Error alarm is raised.
   dbrepllagsecalarmthresh dlsat Defines the lag time in seconds for
   replication after which the [9]Table Replication Lag High alarm is
   raised.
   disableddataauditoperations ddao The list of operations excluded from
   auditing. For more information, see [10]Auditing Data Access Operations
   and [11]Selective Auditing of MapR-FS, MapR-DB Table, and MapR-ES
   Operations Using the CLI.
   enableddataauditoperations edao The list of operations selected for
   auditing. For more information, see [12]Auditing Data Access Operations
   and [13]Selective Auditing of MapR-FS, MapR-DB Table, and MapR-ES
   Operations Using the CLI.
   enforceMinReplicationForIO Indicates whether (true) or not (false) to
   enforce minimum number of replicas for the volume.
   fixCreatorId fcid An internal flag for MapR volumes to fix the creator
   container ID.
   forceAudit Indicates whether (1) or not (0) to force audit of
   operations on all files, tables, and streams in the volume.

   raised.
   LargeRowWarning lrwarning Timestamp when [16]Large Row alarm was
   raised.
   lastSuccessfulMirrorTime lmt Last time when the mirror completed
   successfully.
   limitspread ls An internal flag for MapR volumes to control the growth
   of volumes in terms of the number of containers. When this flag is set,
   CLDB tried to limit the number of new containers created depending on
   the present size of the volume. If the volume size (the data in the
   volume) is small, the CLDB tries to reuse space in existing containers
   thus avoiding the creation of new containers.
   localpath lp Topology of the volume.
   logicalUsed dlu Logical size of disk used by this volume in MB.
   maxinodesalarmthreshold miath The threshold of inodes in use that will
   set off the VOLUME_ALARM_INODES_EXCEEDED alarm.
   metricsEnabled Indicates whether (1) or not (0) metrics collection is
   enabled for the volume.
   minreplicas mrf Minimum number of replicas before re-replication
   starts.
   mirrorDataSrcCluster mdc Name of the cluster of the originator volume.

   identify the mirror family in cascaded mirroring.
