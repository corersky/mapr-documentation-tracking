Table-Replication Alarms

   You can view table-replication alarms in any of these locations:

   MCS

   Alarms for replication appear on the Volume Properties window in the
   MapR Control Service (MCS). They appear on that screen because they are
   issued per volume rather than per source table. An alarm indicates that
   one or more source tables in a volume have encountered problems.

   To open the Volume Properties window for a volume:
    1.
         a. Select Volumes under MapR-FS in the Navigation bar on the left
            side of the screen.
         b. On the right side of the screen, select one of the listed
            volumes. The Volume Properties window opens.

   maprcli

   You can also view the alarms by using the [1]maprcli alarm list
   command.

   Log files

   The log files mfs.log-5 and cldb.log also display these alarms. These
   files are located in the directory /opt/mapr/logs.

   Alarms display the paths and names of the source tables for which the
   alarms were issued. You can look up the error that is specific to the
   source table either in MCS or by using the command [2]maprcli table
   replica list .
