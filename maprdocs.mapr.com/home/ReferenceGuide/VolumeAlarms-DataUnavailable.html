   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_DATA_UNAVAILABLE

   Meaning
          This is a potentially very serious alarm that may indicate data
          loss. Some of the data on the volume cannot be located. This
          alarm indicates that enough nodes have failed to bring the
          replication factor of part or all of the volume to zero. For
          example, if the volume is stored on a single node and has a
          replication factor of one, the Data Unavailable alarm will be
          raised if that volume fails or is taken out of service
          unexpectedly. If a volume is replicated properly (and therefore
          is stored on multiple nodes) then the Data Unavailable alarm can
          indicate that a significant number of nodes is down.

   Resolution
          Investigate any nodes that have failed or are out of service.

          + You can see which nodes have failed by looking at the [1]Node
            Health pane in the Overview page in MCS.
          + Check the cluster(s) for any snapshots or mirrors that can be
            used to re-create the volume. You can see snapshots and
            mirrors in the MapR-FS view.
