   Error While running configure.sh -OT
          When running configure.sh with the -OT option the first time, if
          you see error messages like “directory /opt/mapr/conf/proxy is
          not owned by root”, ignore these transient error messages. If
          you repeatedly see this error during client operations, rerun
          configure.sh with the -R option.
