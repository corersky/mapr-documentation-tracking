Debug Logging Active

   UI Column
          Excess Logs Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_DEBUG_LOGGING

   Meaning
          Debug logging is enabled on the node.

   Resolution
          Debug logging generates enormous amounts of data, and can fill
          up disk space. If debug logging is not absolutely necessary,
          turn it off: use the [1]setloglevel command. If it is absolutely
          necessary, make sure that the logs in /opt/mapr/logs are not in
          danger of filling the entire disk.
