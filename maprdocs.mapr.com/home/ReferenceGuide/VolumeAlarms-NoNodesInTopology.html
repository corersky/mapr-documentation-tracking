No Nodes in Topology

   UI Column
          No Nodes in Vol Topo

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_NO_NODES_IN_TOPOLOGY

   Meaning
          The path specified in the volume's topology no longer
          corresponds to a physical topology that contains any nodes,
          either due to node failures or changes to node topology
          settings. While this alarm is raised, MapR places data for the
          volume on nodes outside the volume's topology to prevent write
          failures.

   Resolution
          Add nodes to the specified volume topology, either by moving
          existing nodes or adding nodes to the cluster. See
          [1]Understanding Topology.
