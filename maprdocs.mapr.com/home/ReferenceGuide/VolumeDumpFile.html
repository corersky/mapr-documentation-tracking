Create and Maintain Volume Dump File

   Describes how to create full dump files and add incremental volume dump
   files.

   You can use volume dump create to create two types of files:
     * full dump files containing all data in a volume
     * incremental dump files that contain changes to a volume between two
       points in time

   A full dump file is useful for restoring a volume from scratch. An
   incremental dump file contains the changes necessary to take an
   existing (or restored) volume from one point in time to another. Along
   with the dump file, a full or incremental dump operation can produce a
   state file (specified by the ?-e parameter) that contains a table of
   the version number of every container in the volume at the time the
   dump file was created. This represents the end point of the dump file,
   which is used as the start point of the next incremental dump. The main
   difference between creating a full dump and creating an incremental
   dump is whether the -s parameter is specified; if -s is not specified,
   the volume create command includes all volume data and creates a full
   dump file. If you create a full dump followed by a series of
   incremental dumps, the result is a sequence of dump files and their
   accompanying state files:

   dumpfile1 statefile1

   dumpfile2 statefile2

   dumpfile3 statefile3
   Note: You can restore the volume from scratch, using the [1]volume dump
   restore command with the full dump file, followed by each dump file in
   sequence.
   Note: In a secure cluster, you must use the MapR user ID. Using root or
   any other user ID results in the system hanging.

   To create and maintain an up-to-date dump of a volume:
    1. Create a full dump file.
       Example:
maprcli volume dump create -name cli-created
                    -dumpfile fulldump1 -e statefile1
    2. Periodically, add an incremental dump file.
       Examples:
maprcli volume dump create -s
                    statefile1 -e statefile2 -name cli-created -dumpfile incrdum
p1 maprcli volume dump create
                    -s statefile2 -e statefile3 -name cli-created -dumpfile incr
dump2 maprcli volume dump
                    create -s statefile3 -e statefile4 -name cli-created -dumpfi
le incrdump3
       ...and so on.
