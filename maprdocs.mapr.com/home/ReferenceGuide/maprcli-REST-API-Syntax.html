maprcli and REST API Syntax

   This section provides information about the MapR command API. Most
   commands can be run on the command-line interface (CLI), or by making
   REST requests programmatically or in a browser.

   To run CLI commands, use an ssh connection to any node in the cluster.
   To use the REST interface, make HTTP requests to a node that is running
   the WebServer service..
