User/Group Alarms

   User/group alarms indicate problems with user or group quotas. The
   following tables describe the MapR user/group alarms.
     * Entity Advisory Quota Alarm
     * Entity Quota Alarm

Entity Advisory Quota Alarm

   UI Column
          User Advisory Quota Alarm

   Logged As
          AE_ALARM_AEADVISORY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED

   Meaning
          A user or group has exceeded its advisory quota. See [1]Setting
          Quota Defaults for Users and Groups for more information about
          user/group quotas.

   Resolution
          No immediate action is required. To avoid exceeding the hard
          quota, clear space on volumes created by the user or group, or
          stop further data writes to those volumes.

   Configuration
          Configurable when setting/modifying entity properties. See
          [2]Configuring the Alarm Threshold Using the CLI for more
          information.

Entity Quota Alarm

          User Quota Alarm

   Logged As
          AE_ALARM_AEQUOTA_EXCEEDED

   Meaning
          A user or group has exceeded its quota. Further writes by the
          user or group will fail. See [3]Setting Quota Defaults for Users
          and Groups and [4]Set or Modify Quotas for Users and/or Groups
          for more information about user/group quotas.

          Free some space on the volumes created by the user or group, or
          increase the user or group quota.

   Configuration
          Configurable when setting/modifying entity properties. See
          [5]Configuring the Alarm Threshold Using the CLI for more
          information.
