mrconfig sp

   The mrconfig sp commands create and control storage pools.

   Storage pools are created on [1]disk groups, so disk groups must be
   [2]created before storage pools can be created.

   MapR-FS reads and writes data (and metadata) to and from logical
   storage units called volumes. Volumes store data in containers in
   storage pools.

   Initially storage pools don't have any containers, the containers are
   automatically created for a volume as needed. When a container is
   created it is assigned a container identifier (cid).

   Storage pools aren't associated with any particular volume â€“ storage
   pools may hold containers for multiple volumes. Large files may be
   distributed across multiple containers, and therefore across multiple
   storage pools. Data replication happens at the container level.

   Data cannot be written directly to containers, a volume is required.

   You can create volumes in one of two ways:
     * Click the New Volume button in the Volumes view of the MapR-FS
       group in the MapR Control System, or

     * Execute the maprcli [3]volume create command.

   See [4]mrconfig for instructions about running mrconfig commands.
