HiveMeta Alarm

   UI Column
          HiveMeta Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_HIVEMETA_DOWN

   Meaning
          The HiveMeta service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether Hive Metastore is running. Warden will try
          three times to restart the service automatically ever 30 minutes
          (by default). This 30 minute interval can be reconfigured using
          the parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec in the warden.conf
          file.

          If warden successfully restarts the Hive Metastore service, the
          alarm is cleared. If warden is unable to restart the Hive
          Metastore service, contact MapR technical support.
