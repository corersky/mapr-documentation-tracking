HiveServer 2 Alarm

   UI Column
          HiveServer 2 Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_HS2_DOWN

   Meaning
          The HiveServer 2 service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether HiveServer 2 is running. Warden will try three
          times to restart the service automatically ever 30 minutes (by
          default). This 30 minute interval can be reconfigured using the
          parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec in the warden.conf
          file.

          If warden successfully restarts the HiveServer 2 service, the
          alarm is cleared. If warden is unable to restart the HiveServer
          2 service, contact MapR technical support.
