WebServer Service Alarm

   UI Column
          Webserver Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_WEBSERVER_DOWN

   Meaning
          The WebServer service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether the WebServer service is running. The warden
          will try three times to restart the service automatically. After
          an interval (30 minutes by default) the warden will again try
          three times to restart the service. The interval can be
          configured using the parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec
          in warden.conf. If the warden successfully restarts the
          WebServer service, the alarm is cleared. If the warden is unable
          to restart the WebServer service, it may be necessary to contact
          technical support.
