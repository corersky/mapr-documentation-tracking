MapR-DB Shell (JSON Tables)

   The mapr dbshell is a tool that enables you to create and perform basic
   manipulation of JSON tables and documents. You run dbshell by typing
   mapr dbshell on the command line after logging into a node in a MapR
   cluster.
   Note: MapR-DB Shell does not support MapR-ES streams operations.

Permissions

   Before running dbshell, your user ID must have both the readAce and
   writeAce permissions on the volume. For information about these
   permissions, see [1]Managing Whole Volume ACEs.

SUSE Linux Error Messages

   When you run dbshell on SUSE Linux, you might see the following
   messages:

   To suppress these messages, edit the /etc/inputrc file and rename the
   keywords as follows:

   backward-delete-word backward-kill-word
   down-history         next-history
   up-history           previous-history
