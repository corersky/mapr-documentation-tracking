stream cursor delete

   Deletes committed cursors that are in the partitions in a stream.
   Note: Deleting the committed cursors for active consumers has no effect
   on the consumers. Consumers use read cursors to keep track of where
   they currently are in partitions.

   For example, the consumer consumer1 continues reading the messages in a
   partition from the position of the consumer's read cursor even after
   the consumer's committed cursor is deleted. However, if consumer1 goes
   offline and the partition is reassigned to another consumer (consumer2)
   in the same consumer group before consumer1 creates another committed
   cursor, consumer2 starts reading the partition at the most recent
   message.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm or consumeperm permission on the stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.
