Parameters

   Parameter

   Description
   path Path to the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, if you want to split regions in a table named
       test under volume1 which has a mount point at /volume1, specify the
       following path: /volume1/test

     * For a path on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, if you want to split regions in a
       table named customer under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster,
       specify the following path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   fid The FID of the region to split. The output of maprcli [4]table
   region list lists the FIDs for the table's regions.
