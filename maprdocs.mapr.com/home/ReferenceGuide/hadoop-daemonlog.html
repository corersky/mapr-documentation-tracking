hadoop daemonlog

   The hadoop daemonlog command gets and sets the log level for each
   daemon.

   Hadoop daemons all produce logfiles that you can use to learn about
   what is happening on the system. You can use the hadoop daemonlog
   command to temporarily change the log level of a component when
   debugging the system.

Examples

   Getting the log levels of a daemon

   To get the log level for each daemon enter a command such as the
   following:
hadoop daemonlog -getlevel 10.250.1.15:50030 org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resou
rcemanager.resourcemanager
Connecting to http://10.250.1.15:50030/logLevel?log=org.apache.hadoop.yarn.serve
r.resourcemanager.resourcemanager
Submitted Log Name: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.resourcemanage
r
Log Class: org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger
Effective level: ALL

   Setting the log level of a daemon

   To temporarily set the log level for a daemon enter a command such as
   the following:
hadoop daemonlog -setlevel 10.250.1.15:50030 org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resou
rcemanager.resourcemanager DEBUG
Connecting to http://10.250.1.15:50030/logLevel?log=org.apache.hadoop.yarn.serve
r.resourcemanager.resourcemanager&level=DEBUG
Submitted Log Name: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.resourcemanage
r
Log Class: org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger
Submitted Level: DEBUG
Setting Level to DEBUG ...
Effective level: DEBUG

   Using this method, the log level is automatically reset when the daemon
   is restarted.

   To make the change to log level of a daemon persistent, enter a command
   such as the following:
hadoop daemonlog -setlevel 10.250.1.15:50030 log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.yarn
.server.resourcemanager.resourcemanager DEBUG
