pullcentralconfig

   The script /opt/mapr/server/pullcentralconfig on each node pulls master
   configuration files from /var/mapr/configuration on the cluster to the
   local disk:
     * If the master configuration file is newer, the local copy is
       overwritten by the master copy
     * If the local configuration file is newer, no changes are made to
       the local copy

   The volume mapr.configuration (normally mounted at
   /var/mapr/configuration) contains directories with master configuration
   files:
     * Configuration files in the default directory are applied to all
       nodes
     * To specify custom configuration files for individual nodes, create
       directories corresponding to individual hostnames. For example, the
       configuration files in a directory named
       /var/mapr/configuration/nodes/host1.r1.nyc would only be applied to
       the machine with the hostname host1.r1.nyc.

   The following parameters in warden.conf control whether central
   configuration is enabled, the path to the master configuration files,
   and how often pullcentralconfig runs:
     * centralconfig.enabled — Specifies whether to enable central
       configuration.
     * pollcentralconfig.interval.seconds — The frequency to check for
       configuration updates, in seconds.
