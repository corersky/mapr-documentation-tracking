stream upstream add

   Registers a stream as an upstream source for a given stream. For
   example, if you wanted to replicate messages from Stream_A to Stream_B,
   Stream_A would be the upstream source for Stream_B.

Permissions Required on the Target Cluster

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm permission on the source stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.
