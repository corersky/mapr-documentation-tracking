mapr perfproducer

   This utility runs a producer, generating messages and publishing them
   to a MapR stream. Use this utility to run producers when you want to
   estimate the performance of producers for your MapR-ES applications,
   given your network configuration.

   This utility starts a producer and generates data for the producer to
   publish in messages to a MapR stream. When starting the utility, you
   can specify how many topics the producer publishes to, how many
   partitions to create for each topic, and how many messages to publish
   to each partition. You can also specify the method for distributing
   messages among the partitions in each topic.
   For example, suppose you run the utility by issuing this command:
mapr perfproducer -path /myVolume/myDirectory/stream_a -ntopics 40 -npart -5
-nmsgs 100000 -rr true

   The producer automatically creates 40 topics in the stream, creating
   each topic as it writes the first message to that topic. Each topic is
   created with 5 partitions. The producer writes 100,000 messages to each
   partition for a total of 20,000,000 messages. After publishing all of
   the messages, the utility terminates.

   The mapr perfproducer utility uses the default values for all of the
   configuration parameters that apply to producers. For a list of these
   parameters, see [1]MapR-ES Configuration Parameters.

   Each producer runs as a single thread. You can run multiple instances
   of the utility at the same time. However, because producers can be
   CPU-intensive, it is recommended to run at most 4 or 5 on a single
   cluster node.

   When multiple instances of the mapr perfproducer utility publish to a
   single stream, the separate instances share topics. For example, if
   -ntopics is set to 40 for each instance that publishes to a single
   stream, together those instances create no more than 40 topics in the
   stream and they share those topics.

   It is recommended that all producers that publish to a single cluster
   publish to the same number of topics and partitions within those
   topics. Therefore, use the same values for -ntopics and -npart for each
   instance of the mapr perfproducer utility that shares a stream with
   other instances.

   Monitor the performance of the running instances of the mapr
   perfproducer utility by issuing the maprcli command [2]stream topic
   info at intervals, as described in [3]Monitoring Producers. The command
   stream topic info shows statistics for single topics. Because all of
   the topics that mapr perfproducer creates have the same number of
   partitions, and because mapr perfproducer writes the same number of
   messages to each partition, you can assume that the statistics that the
   command stream topic info displays for any one topic are close to the
   statistics for any other topic. The naming convention that mapr
   perfproducer uses when creating topics is simply topicn, which produces
   the names topic0, topic1, and so on. You can run the command stream
   topic info with any one of these names as the value of the -topic
   parameter.

   To simulate consumers to estimate the performance of MapR-ES in your
   network configuration, run one or more instances of the mapr
   perfconsumer utility against the stream.

Prerequisites for running this utility

     * Create a MapR stream in a MapR cluster for the mapr perfproducer
       utility to publish messages to. See [4]stream create.
       If you plan to replicate the stream for the purposes of the
       performance estimate, create the replica stream. Then, start
       replication from the first stream to the replica stream. For
       instructions on setting up replication between streams, see
       [5]Managing Stream Replication.
     * Ensure that the user ID that runs the mapr perfproducer utility has
       the readAce and writeAce permissions on the volume where the stream
       is located.
     * Ensure that the user ID that runs the mapr perfproducer utility has
       the produceperm and topicperm permissions on the stream.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [6]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on streams, see
   [7]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

mapr perfproducer
-path <stream-full-name>
[ -ntopics <num topics> (default: 2) ]
[ -npart <numpartitions per topic> (default: 4) ]
[ -nmsgs <num messages per topicfeed> (default: 100000) ]
[ -msgsz <msg value size> (default: 200) ]
[ -rr <round robin true/false> (default: false) ]
[ -hashkey <true/false> (default: false) ]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path The path to the stream.
   ntopics The number of topics for the producer to publish to in the
   stream.

   The default is 2.
   npart The number of partitions to create for each topic.

   The default is 4.
   nmsgs The number of messages to publish to each partition.

   The default is 100,000.
   msgz The size of each message in bytes.

   The default is 200 bytes.
   rr Specifies to publish messages to partitions within a topic in
   round-robin fashion. See [8]How Partitions are Chosen for Messages for
   detail about this method of distributing messages among topic
   partitions.
   Note: This parameter is incompatible with the -hashkey parameter. You
   must set one or the other to true, but not both.

   The default is false.
   hashkey Specifies to distribute messages among topic partitions
   according to the hash of each message key. See [9]How Partitions are
   Chosen for Messages for detail about this method of distributing
   messages among topic partitions.
   Note: This parameter is incompatible with the -rr parameter. You must
   set one or the other to true, but not both.

   The default is true.
