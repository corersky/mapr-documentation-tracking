stream topic edit

   Allows you to increase the number of partitions that are in the
   specified topic.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * topicperm permission on the stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI
maprcli stream topic edit
         -path <Stream Path>
         -topic <Topic Name>
        [ -partitions <Number of partitions> ]
       [ -timestamptype Timestamp type: createtime | logappendtime default: crea
tetime ]

   REST
   http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/stream/topic/edit?path=<path>&topic=<name>
   &partitions=<number>

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path The path and name of the stream in which the topic is located.
   topic The name of the topic to edit.
   partitions The number of partitions to use for the topic. You cannot
   reduce the number of partitions.

   To find out how many partitions a topic is currently using, run the
   command maprcli stream topic info.
   Important: A CDC changelog stream's default partitions can impact how
   many partitions a stream topic can have. This is because once you
   create a stream topic for a changelog stream, the number of topic
   partitions is locked. The number of topic partitions cannot change and
   the stream topic edit command can not modify the topic's partition
   number.
     * If the stream topic create command is used to create a stream
       topic, then the number of topic partitions can be set at creation
       time and then is locked.
     * If the [4]table changelog add command is used to add a stream topic
       (as well as establish a relationship between the source table and
       the changelog stream), then the number of topic partitions is
       inherited from the changelog stream and is locked.

   timestamptype Specifies the type of timestamp stored in the topic's
   message. Value: createtime | logappendtime Default: createtime. The
   topic inherits the default value from the stream unless the topic sets
   the timestamp type to a different value.

   A createtime value is the time defined by the user or application (when
   creating the message). If user or application does not define this
   value (or passes null), the client uses the current system timestamp.

   A logappendtime value is the time when the message (log) was appended
   to the server.
