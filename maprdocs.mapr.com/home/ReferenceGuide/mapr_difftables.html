MapR-DB JSON DiffTables

   Compares the row keys, column families, and field values in two JSON
   tables. Then, generates two directories that contain sequence files
   that you can use to merge the rows from the two JSON tables.

   Sequence files are binary flat files. For more detail, see [1]Sequence
   File. To convert a sequence file into a format that you can read, use
   the mapr formatresult utility.

   This utility considers both the source table and the destination table
   to be a master table. Therefore, it generates two directories with
   sequence files. These sequence files contain the puts required to
   update each table so that it contains a superset of the rows defined in
   both tables at the time at which the utility was run.
   This utility generates both of the following output directories in the
   output directory that you specify:

   opsForDst
          A directory containing sequence files that correspond to each
          put and delete required to make the destination table identical
          to the source table.

   opsForSrc
          A directory containing sequence files that correspond to each
          put and delete required to make the source table identical to
          the destination table.

   A user with write permissions on a table can run the mapr importtable
   utility to implement the changes that are specified in the sequence
   files.

Required Permissions

   The user that runs the mapr difftables utility must have the following
   permissions:
     * The permission readAce on the volumes where the tables are located.
     * The permission for column reads (readperm) on each table.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [2]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on tables, see [3]Enabling
   Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

mapr difftables
-src <source table path>
-dst <destination table path>
-outdir <output directory>
[-first_exit Exit when first difference is found. ]
[-columns comma-separated list of field paths ]
[-mapreduce] <true|false> (default: true)]
[-numthreads <numThreads> (default:16, valid only when -mapreduce is false)]
[-cmpmeta <true|false> (default: true)]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   src The path of the first table to include in the comparison.
   dst The path of the second table to include in the comparison.
   first_exit

   By default, the utility compares all the table cells in the specified
   tables. Use this parameter if you want to exit after the first
   difference is identified between the tables. The parameter takes no
   value.
   outdir The path to a directory in which to place the generated sequence
   files. The utility creates the specified directory. If the specified
   directory already exists, the command fails.
   columns By default, the utility compares all fields in JSON tables. If
   you do not want to compare all fields, you can specify specific fields
   to include in the comparison. For example, suppose that want to compare
   a source table in table replication with a replica of that table. When
   you set up replication, you chose to replicate the default column
   family and two additional column families: cf1 and cf2. For the
   -columns parameter, you would specify the value ",cf1,cf2", where the
   default column family is represented by the empty string.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the comparison. The default, preferred method is to
   use a MapReduce program (true).

   When this parameter is set to false, a client process uses multiple
   threads to perform the comparison.
   numthreads When -mapreduce is false, this parameter specifies the
   number of threads allocated to perform the comparison. The default is
   16. If additional CPU resources are available, you might want to
   increase the number of thread to achieve better performance.
   cmpmeta A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to compare table
   metadata such as column families and ACEs. The default is to compare
   metadata (true).

Example

   The following example shows a comparison of two JSON tables
[user@hostname ~]$ mapr difftables -src /source_JSON_table -dst /destination_JSO
