MapR-DB Binary DiffTablesWithCrc

   This utility uses a cyclic redundancy check to detect differences
   between sets of rows in the specified MapR-DB binary tables. Then, for
   each set of non-identical rows, it performs a detailed comparison.
   Finally, it generates one or more directories of sequence files. You
   can use these files either to make a MapR-DB binary table identical to
   its master or merge the rows from two MapR-DB binary tables.

   Sequence files are binary flat files. You can learn more about them
   [1]here. To convert a sequence file into a format that you can read,
   use the [2]MapR-DB Binary FormatResult utility.

   This utility requires less network bandwidth than the DiffTables
   utility because it performs a detailed table comparison only on the
   sets of rows where the CRC algorithm detected a difference. Therefore,
   consider using this utility when the tables you compare are very
   similar and you are concerned about the data transfer rate.

Requirements

     * When the cluster runs YARN, it must also use zero configuration
       failover for the ResourceManager.

   By default, the utility considers both the source table and the
   destination table to be a master table. Therefore, it generates two
   directories with sequence files. These sequence files contain the puts
   required to update each table so that it can contain a superset of the
   rows defined in both tables at the time at which the utility was run.

   When you specify a master table, the mapr difftableswithcrc utility
   generates one of the following output directories:
     * opsForDst. A directory containing sequence files that correspond to
       each put and delete required to make the destination table
       identical to the source table.
     * opsForSrc. A directory containing sequence files that correspond to
       each put and delete required to make the source table identical to
       the destination table.

   A user with write permissions on a table can run the hbase
   org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.Import command to implement the puts
   and deletes specified in the sequence files.

Required Permissions

   The user that runs the mapr difftableswithcrc utility must have the
   following permissions:
     * The permission readAce on the volumes where the tables are located.
     * The permission for column reads (readperm) on each table.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [3]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on tables, see [4]Enabling
   Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.DiffTablesWithCrc
-src <source table path>
-dst <destination table path>
-outdir <output directory>
[-master src|dst ] The master table to use for the diff.
[-first_exit] Exit when first difference is found.
[-cf <comma separated list of column families>]
[-starttime <start diff at timestamp>]
[-endtime <end diff at timestamp>]
[-maxVersions <max number of versions to copy>]
[-cmpmeta <true|false> (default: true)]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   src

   The path to the source table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testsrc under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following
       path:/volume1/testsrc
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customersrc under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customersrc

   dst

   The path to the destination table.
     * For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
       mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under a volume
       with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testdst
     * For a table on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customerdst under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   master

   The table that is considered to be the master table. The values are src
   (the source table) and dst (the destination table). By default, both
   the source table and the destination table are considered to be the
   master.
   first_exit

   By default, the utility compares all the table cells in the specified
   tables. Set this parameter if you want to exit after the first
   difference is identified between the tables.
   outdir The path to a directory for the sequence files. The utility will
   create the specified directory. If the specified directory already
   exists, the command will fail.
   cf By default, the utility compares all columns from the master table.
   If you do not want to compare all columns in the table, you can specify
   specific columns to include in the comparison. Provide a
   comma-separated list of column families or columns from a certain
   column family (column family:qualifier). For example, use the following
   syntax to include the column family purchases and the column stars in
   the reviews column family: -columns purchases,reviews:stars
   starttime By default, the utility compares all table values regardless
   of their associated timestamp. You can specify a timestamp to indicate
   the table cell version at which to start the comparison. The timestamp
   is a long integer value that is either user-defined or system-defined
   (epoch in milliseconds). Values with timestamps lower than the
   specified timestamp will not be included in the comparison.
   endtime By default, the utility compares all table values regardless of
   their associated timestamp. You can specify a timestamp to indicate the
   table cell version at which to end the comparison. The timestamp is a
   long integer value that is either user-defined or system-defined (epoch
   in milliseconds). Values with timestamps greater than or equal to the
   specified timestamp will not be included in the comparison.
   maxVersions By default, the utility compares all versions from the
   master table. If you do not want to diff all versions, use this
   parameter to specify the number of recent versions to include in the
   comparison.
   cmpmeta A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to compare table
   metadata such as column families and ACEs. The default is to compare
   metadata (true).

Example

   Compares two MapR-DB tables:
[user@hostname ~]$ hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.DiffTablesWithCrc -sr
c /customerTableA -dst /customerTableB -outdir /customerTableCompare
2015-03-04 17:52:40,912 INFO  [main] Configuration.deprecation: hadoop.native.li
b is deprecated. Instead, use io.native.lib.available
DiffTablesMeta completed. Metadata of the two tables is same.
....
Mapreduce job completed. The tables mismatch.
NUM_ROWS_MISMATCH_IN_SRC:32; NUM_ROWS_MISMATCH_IN_DST:30. Please check diff in /
customerTableCompare
