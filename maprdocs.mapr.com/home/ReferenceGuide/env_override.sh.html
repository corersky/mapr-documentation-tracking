About env_override.sh

   env_override.sh is a file that you can create to store custom settings
   for environment variables. By default, /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh contains
   environment variables for a MapR cluster, but upgrading to a new MapR
   release causes the env.sh file to be replaced. (A backup is stored as
   /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh<timestemp>). When env.sh is replaced, any custom
   settings are removed.

   For MapR 6.0 and later, keep any custom settings in
   /opt/mapr/conf/env_override.sh. It is no longer necessary to modify
   env.sh.

   env_override.sh is not removed or modified during an upgrade.
   /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh reads the env_override.sh file at the end of its
   execution. If the same parameter is listed in both env.sh and
   env_override.sh, the value specified in env_override.sh is used. If
   env_override.sh is not present, the values in env.sh are used.

   You create env_override.sh from a blank file and insert export
   statements into the file.
