service list

   Lists all services on the specified node, the memory allocated for each
   service, the state of each service, and log path for each service.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli service list
    -node <node name>
    [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
    [ -zkconnect <ZooKeeper connect string> ]
    [ -output terse|verbose ]

   REST

          Request Type GET
          Request URL
http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/service/list?<parameters>

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description
   cluster The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is
   omitted, the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.
   node The node for which to list services. Default: localhost. If this
   is not specified, the /etc/hosts file must include the IP address or
   hostname for the localhost.
   output Whether the output should be terse or verbose. Default: verbose.
   zkconnect A ZooKeeper connect string, which specifies a list of the
   hosts running ZooKeeper, and the port to use on each, in the format:
   '<host>[:<port>][,<host>[:<port>]...]'. To obtain zookeeper connection
   strings, use the maprcli node listzookeepers command.

Output Fields

      Field                          Description
   memallocated The amount of system memory allocated to the service.
   name         Service name.
   state        Current state of the service. See [1]Service States.
   logpath      Path to the log files for the service.
   displayname  Display name of the service in the MCS.

Service States

   The following table lists the service states with their descriptions:
   State Description
   0 Not configured. The package for the service is not installed and/or
   the service is not configured (configure.sh has not run).
   1 Configured. The package for the service is installed and configured.
   2 Running. The service is installed, started by the warden, and is
   currently running.
   3 Stopped. The service is installed and configure.sh has run, but the
   service is not running.
   4 Failed. The service is installed and configured, but not running.
   5 Stand by. The service is installed and is in standby mode, waiting to
   take over in case of failure of another instance.

Examples

   CLI Example

   The following output is an example of the service information returned
   when you run the service list command:
# maprcli service list
logpath                                 displayname         name             sta
te
/opt/mapr/logs/mfs.log                  FileServer          fileserver       0

/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/logs      ResourceManager     resourcemanager  0

/opt/mapr/logs/cldb.log                 CLDB                cldb             0

/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/logs      NodeManager         nodemanager      0

/opt/mapr/logs/gateway.log              GatewayService      gateway          0

/opt/mapr/logs/hoststats.log            HostStats           hoststats        0

/opt/mapr/apiserver/logs/apiserver.log  APIServer           apiserver        0

   REST Example

   The following output is an example of the service information returned
   when you issue the service list REST API call:
# curl -k -X GET 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/service/list' --user mapr:mapr
{"timestamp":1529380971417,"timeofday":"2018-06-18 09:02:51.417 GMT-0700 PM","st
atus":"OK","total":9,"data":[{"name":"fileserver","state":0,"logpath":"/opt/mapr
/logs/mfs.log","displayname":"FileServer"},{"name":"resourcemanager","state":0,"
logpath":"/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/logs","displayname":"ResourceManager"},{
"name":"cldb","state":0,"logpath":"/opt/mapr/logs/cldb.log","displayname":"CLDB"
},{"name":"nodemanager","state":0,"logpath":"/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/logs"
,"displayname":"NodeManager"},{"name":"gateway","state":0,"logpath":"/opt/mapr/l
ogs/gateway.log","displayname":"GatewayService"},{"name":"hoststats","state":0,"
logpath":"/opt/mapr/logs/hoststats.log","displayname":"HostStats"},{"name":"apis
erver","state":0,"logpath":"/opt/mapr/apiserver/logs/apiserver.log","displayname
":"APIServer"}]}

   Note: When you configure high availability for the ResourceManager, the
   status of standby ResourceManager service differs based on the selected
   failover implementation. When the cluster uses manual or automatic
   failover for the ResourceManager, standby ResourceManagers have a state
   equal to 2 (running). When the cluster uses zero configuration failover
   for the ResourceManager, standby ResourceManagers have a state equal to
   5 (stand by).
