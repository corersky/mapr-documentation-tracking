table cf delete

   Deletes a column family from a MapR-DB binary table or JSON table.
   Deletion cannot be undone.
   Important: As of MapR 6.0, a column family cannot be deleted from a
   JSON table.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * deletefamilyperm on the table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path

   The path to the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under volume1 which has
       a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/test

     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named test under volume1
       in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   cfname

   The name of the column family to delete.
   Note: In JSON tables, it is not possible to delete column families in
   addition to the default column family.

Example

   Deletes a column family mycf from table thetable:

   CLI

maprcli table cf delete -path /volume1/thetable -cfname mycf

   REST

  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/cf/delete?path=%2Fvolume1%2Fthetable&cfnam
e=mycf' \
