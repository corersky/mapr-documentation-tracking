volume audit

   Enables or disables auditing on the specified volume.

   You must have the fc permission on the cluster to use this command. See
   [1]acl for details about this permission.

   To learn how to determine whether auditing is enabled for a volume, see
   [2]Checking Whether Auditing is Enabled for a Directory, File, or
   MapR-DB Table.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli volume audit
   [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
   -name <volume name>
   [-dataauditops <+|-operations>]
   [ -enabled <true|false> ]
   [ -forceenable true|false ]
   [ -coalesce <interval in minutes> ]

   REST

          Request Type POST
          Request URL
http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/volume/audit?<parameters>

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description
   cluster The cluster on which the volume is located. This parameter is
   required if the volume is on a remote cluster. The remote cluster must
   be listed in the mapr-clusters.conf file for the cluster where you run
   the command.
   coalesce The interval of time during which READ, WRITE, or GETATTR
   operations on one file from one client IP address are logged only once,
   if auditing is enabled.

   For example, suppose that a client application reads a single file
   three times in 6 minutes, so that there is one read at 0 minutes,
   another at 3 minutes, and a final read at 6 minutes. If the coalesce
   interval is at least 6 minutes, then only the first read operation is
   logged. However, if the interval is between 4 minutes, then only the
   first and third read operations are logged. If the interval is 2
   minutes, all three read operations are logged.

   The default value is 60 minutes. Setting this field to a larger number
   helps prevent audit logs from growing quickly.
   dataauditops The comma separated list of filesystem operations to
   include (specified with a preceding plus sign (+)) and/or exclude
   (specified with a preceding minus sign (-)) from auditing.
   Note: If the first operation in the list is to be excluded from
   auditing, it must be preceded by two minus (--) signs. Subsequent
   operations to exclude must be preceded by only a single minus (-) sign,
   whether or not the first operation was included (using a plus (+) sign)
   or excluded (using two minus (--) signs). If neither sign is specified,
   the given operation is included for auditing.

   The operations that can be included (+) and/or excluded (-) from
   auditing are listed [3]here. You can, alternatively, group all the
   filesystem and table operations using the keyword all, which:
     * If included (+), cannot be specified with a list of other included
       operations.
     * If excluded (-), cannot be specified with a list of other excluded
       operations.

   Note: You can specify a mixed list of included and excluded operations.
   There are no changes to operations that are not specified with the
   command.
   enabled Enables or disables the auditing of operations within the
   volume. You must use either this parameter, the -coalesce parameter, or
   both.

   See [4]Enabling Auditing for the steps to enable auditing on
   directories, files, and tables in a volume.

   When you set the value to false, auditing of operations within the
   volume ceases. None of the auditing settings are changed on the
   directories, files, and MapR-DB tables within the volume. If you later
   run the maprcli volume audit command with -enabled set to true,
   auditing begins again on the objects that were already enabled for
   auditing.
   forceenable Enables or disables auditing of all directories, files,
   tables, and streams in the volume whether or not auditing is enabled at
   the individual file, table, and/or stream level.
   name The name of the volume.

Examples

   Enable Auditing for a volume

   The following example shows how to enable auditing for the volume
   “auditVolume”:
     * [5]CLI
     * [6]REST

maprcli volume audit -name auditVolume

https://centos26.lab:8443/rest/volume/audit?name=auditVolume

   Modify the list of operations to audit

   The following example shows how to specify the operations to audit.
   Here, create operation is included for auditing and lookup operation is
   excluded from auditing. There are no changes to operations that are not
   specified.
     * [7]CLI
     * [8]REST

maprcli volume audit -name sampleAuditVolume -dataauditops +create,-lookup

https://centos26.lab:8443/rest/volume/audit?name=sampleAuditVolume&dataauditops=
%2Bcreate%2C%2Dlookup
