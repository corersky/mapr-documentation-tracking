table replica list

   Lists replicas and the associated replica statistics for a specified
   MapR-DB binary or JSON table. By default, replica statistics are
   updated every five minutes.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce on the volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the path

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table replica list
  -path <table path>
  [ -refreshnow true|false ]

   REST

curl -k -X GET
  'http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/table/replica/list?path=<path>&refreshnow=false'
  -u <username>:<password>

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path

   The path to the table that you want to list replicas for.
     * For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
       mount point. For example, for a table named test under a volume
       with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/test
     * For a table on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer under
       volume1 in the sanfranciscocluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   refreshnow A Boolean value that specifies if you want to trigger an
   immediate update of the replica statistics. The values are true or
   false. By default, the value is false; the command lists the current
   version of the replica statistics, which could be a maximum of five
   minutes old.

Output

   Lists information about each replica for the specified table.
   Output Data Fields

   The following fields display for each replica.
   Field Description
   cluster The cluster on which the replica resides.
   table The table name for the replica.
   type The table type.
   paused A Boolean values that specifies if replication is paused.
   replicaPath The table replica path.
   replicaState The replication state. For information about the
   replication states, see [1]Table Replication States.
   throttle A Boolean value that specifies if replication is throttled.
   idx The internal index value.
   networkencryption A Boolean value that specifies if replication is
   encrypted.
   synchronous A Boolean value that specifies whether replication is
   synchronous or asynchronous.
   networkcompression The type of on-wire compression.
   isUptodate A Boolean value that specifies if the replica is up-to-date.
   minPendingTS The epoch time in milliseconds of the oldest operation
   that has yet to be replicated to the replica.
   maxPendingTS The epoch time in milliseconds of the newest operation
   that has yet to be replicated to the replica.
   bytesPending The number of bytes that have yet to be replicated to the
   replica.
   putsPending The number of puts that have yet to be replicated to the
   replica.
   bucketsPending The number of buckets that have yet to be replicated to
   the replica.
   uuid The table UUID.
   copyTableCompletionPercentage When replica autosetup with directcopy is
   in progress, this value is the percentage of data from the source that
   has been copied to the replica. After replication is setup, the value
   remains at 100.
   Note: When replicating MapR-DB data, the copyTablePercentageCompletion
   data may re-adjust to a lower rate. This depends on table region (also
   referred to as tablets) splits and merges as well as the rate of
   incoming data to replicating data.
   errors If applicable, an error is displayed.
