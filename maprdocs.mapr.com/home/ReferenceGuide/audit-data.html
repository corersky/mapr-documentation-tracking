   Enables and disables auditing of filesystem and table operations.

   For a list of these operations, see [1]Auditing of Filesystem
   Operations and Table Operations.

   Only the mapr user for the cluster can run this command. For more
   information about the mapr user, see [2]Managing Users and Groups.

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   cluster The path and name of a remote MapR cluster.
   enabled The value true enables auditing, the value false disables it.
   maxsize The size in GB at which an alarm is sent to the dashboard in
   the MapR Control Service. The alarm is to notify the cluster
   administrator that the audit log is becoming large enough that the
   administrator might want to take action. For more information about
   this parameter, the alarm, and possible actions to take, see
   [3]Managing Audit Logs for Filesystem and Table Operations.

   The audit log continues to grow until the administrator takes action or
   until the retention period ends.

   The default value is 32.
   retention The period of time in days for which to keep the data in the
   audit log for the data access. After this period elapses, the content
   of the file is deleted and new entries are added to the file until the
   next retention period elapses.
