mrconfig sp online

   The mrconfig sp online command makes an offline storage pool online.

   When a storage pool is taken offline with the [1]mrconfig sp offline
   command, the storage pool is not available for reads and writes.
   Typically this is done so the [2]fsck (filesystem check) command can be
   run to check for or repair filesystem inconsistencies.

   After the storage pool is put back online with the mrconfig sp online
   command, the storage pool is once again available for reads and writes,
   and the [3]gfsck (global filesystem check) command can be run on the
   affected cluster, volumes or snapshots.

   See [4]mrconfig for instructions on running mrconfig commands.
