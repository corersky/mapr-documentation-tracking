mrconfig sp make

   The mrconfig sp make command creates a storage pool on a concat disk
   group.
   Warning: Creating a Storage Pool Causes Data Loss

   Creating a storage pool on a disk group destroys the data on the disks
   in the disk group, so be sure that all data on the disks in the disk
   group is backed up and replicated before creating a storage pool.

   See [1]mrconfig for instructions on running mrconfig commands.
