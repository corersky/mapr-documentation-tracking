table index list

   This topic describes how to list information about the secondary
   indexes created on MapR-DB JSON tables.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce on the volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the table path

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table index list
  -path <path>
  [ -indexname <index name> ]
  [ -refreshnow < true | false > ]

   REST

curl -k -X GET
  'http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/table/index/list?path=<path>&<parameters>'
  -u <username>:<password>

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description

   path
   (Required) Path to where the parent JSON table resides
   indexname (Optional) Name of the index for which to display
   information. If omitted, the output includes all indexes created on the
   table.

   refreshnow
   (Optional) Whether to fetch the current status of the index

   Default: False

Example

   CLI

maprcli table index list -path /my.cluster.com/volume1/table1

maprcli table index list -path /demo/business -json

   REST

curl -k -X GET \
  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/index/list?path=%my.cluster.com%2Fvolume1%
2Ftable1' \
  -u mapr:mapr

curl -k -X GET \
  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/index/list?path=%2Fdemo%2Fbusiness' \
  -u mapr:mapr

Output Fields

   Output Field Description
   cluster The cluster on which the index resides
   type For indexes, this is always maprdb.si
   indexFid A unique id used to identify the index in MapR-FS
   indexName Name of the index
   hashed A boolean value that specifies whether the index is hashed
   indexState The replication state of the index. For information about
   the replication states, see [1]Table Replication States.
   idx The index id. Unique per table.
   indexedFields The list of indexed fields with the sort order of each
   key
   includedFields The list of included fields in the index. Missing from
   output if there are no included fields.
   isUptodate A boolean value that specifies if the index is up-to-date
   minPendingTS The epoch time in milliseconds of the oldest operation
   that has yet to be replicated to the index
   maxPendingTS The epoch time in milliseconds of the newest operation
   that has yet to be replicated to the index
   bytesPending The number of bytes that have yet to be replicated to the
   index
   putsPending The number of puts that have yet to be replicated to the
   index
   bucketsPending The number of buckets that have yet to be replicated to
   the index
   copyTableCompletionPercentage
   The percentage of data from the source that has been copied to the
   index during the setup phase of replication. After replication setup
   completes, the value remains at 100.
   Note: When replicating data to the index, the
   copyTableCompletionPercentage value may decrease. This happens when
   splits or merges occur in the JSON table's regions, or the table
   receives new data.
   numTablets The number of tablets the index occupies
   numRows The number of rows in the index
   totalSize The total size of the index

Example Output

maprcli table index list -path /demo/business -json -indexname i1
{
        "timestamp":1506617667735,
        "timeofday":"2017-09-28 04:54:27.735 GMT+0000 PM",
        "status":"OK",
        "total":1,
        "data":[
                {
                        "cluster":"my.cluster.com",
                        "type":"maprdb.si",
                        "indexFid":"2049.93.10257820",
                        "indexName":"i1",
                        "hashed":false,
                        "indexState":"REPLICA_STATE_REPLICATING",
                        "idx":1,
                        "indexedFields":"a.b:ASC",
                        "isUptodate":true,
                        "minPendingTS":0,
                        "maxPendingTS":0,
                        "bytesPending":0,
                        "putsPending":0,
                        "bucketsPending":0,
                        "copyTableCompletionPercentage":100,
                        "numTablets":1,
                        "numRows":4,
                        "totalSize":24576
                }
        ]
}

Troubleshooting Use Cases

   Situations where you can use this command include the following:
     * Examine the properties of an index.
     * Determine if there is a lag in updates in an index.

   See [2]Troubleshooting Secondary Indexes for more information on these
   use cases.
