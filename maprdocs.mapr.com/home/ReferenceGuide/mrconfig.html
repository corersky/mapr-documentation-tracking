mrconfig

   The mrconfig commands let you create, remove, and manage storage pools,
   disk groups, and disks; and provide information about containers.
   Note: The mrconfig commands provide direct control and access to
   MapR-FS at a low level. If you are not careful, or do not know what you
   are doing, you can irrevocably destroy valuable data.
