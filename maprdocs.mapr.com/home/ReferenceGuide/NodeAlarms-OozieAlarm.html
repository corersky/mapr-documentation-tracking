Oozie Alarm

   UI Column
          Oozie Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_OOZIE_DOWN

   Meaning
          The Oozie service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether Oozie is running. Warden will try three times
          to restart Oozie automatically ever 30 minutes (by default).
          This 30 minute interval can be reconfigured using the parameter
          services.retryinterval.time.sec in the warden.conf file.

          If warden successfully restarts Oozie, the alarm is cleared. If
          warden is unable to restart Oozie, contact MapR technical
          support.
