Restore Volume From a Dump

   Describes how to restore from full and incremental dump files.

   There are two ways to use volume dump restore:
     * With a full dump file, volume dump restore recreates a volume from
       scratch from volume data stored in the dump file.
     * With an incremental dump file, volume dump restore updates a volume
       using incremental changes stored in the dump file.

   The volume that results from a volume dump restore operation is a
   mirror volume whose source is the volume from which the dump was
   created. After the operation, this volume can perform mirroring from
   the source volume.

   When you are updating a volume from an incremental dump file, you must
   specify an existing volume and an incremental dump file. To restore
   from a sequence of previous dump files would involve first restoring
   from the volume's full dump file, then applying each subsequent
   incremental dump file.
   Note: In a secure cluster, you must use the MapR user ID. Using root or
   any other user ID results in the system hanging.

   A restored volume may contain mount points that represent volumes that
   were mounted under the original source volume from which the dump was
   created. In the restored volume, these mount points have no meaning and
   do not provide access to any volumes that were mounted under the source
   volume. If the source volume still exists, then the mount points in the
   restored volume will work if the restored volume is associated with the
   source volume as a mirror.

   To restore from a full dump plus a sequence of incremental dumps:
    1. Restore from the full dump file, using the -n option to create a
       new mirror volume and the -name option to specify the name.
       Example:
maprcli volume dump restore -dumpfile fulldump1 -name restore1 -n
    2. Restore from each incremental dump file in order, specifying the
       same volume name.
       Examples:
maprcli volume dump restore -dumpfile incrdump1 -name restore1 maprcli
                        volume dump restore -dumpfile incrdump2 -name restore1 m
aprcli volume dump restore
                        -dumpfile incrdump3 -name restore1
       ...and so on.
