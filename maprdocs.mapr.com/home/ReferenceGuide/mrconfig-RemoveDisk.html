Removing Disks Using mrconfig

   Suppose one of three disks in a storage pool has failed, and the
   storage pool has gone offline.

   To remove a disk with mrconfig disk remove:
    1. Ensure that the data on the surviving disks is backed
       up/replicated.
    2. Remove the failed disk from the node's disktab with the mrconfig
       disk remove command.
    3. Physically remove the failed disk.
    4. Physically attach the replacement disk.
    5. Run the [1]mrconfig disk init command on the replacement disk and
       on the other two disks that were in the disk group.
    6. Run the [2]mrconfig disk load command on each of the three disks.
    7. Use the [3]mrconfig dg create command to create a new disk group
       with the three disks.
    8. Use the [4]mrconfig sp make command to create a storage pool on the
       new disk group.
