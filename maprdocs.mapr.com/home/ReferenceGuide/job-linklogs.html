job linklogs

   Creates symbolic links to all the logs relating to the activity of a
   specific job.

   The maprcli job linklogs command works with the [1]Centralized Logging
   to provide a job-centric view or an application-centric view of all log
   files generated during job or application execution.

   The output of job linklogs is a directory populated with symbolic links
   to all log files related to the specified job(s) or to the application.
   The command can be performed during or after a job or application is
   processed.
