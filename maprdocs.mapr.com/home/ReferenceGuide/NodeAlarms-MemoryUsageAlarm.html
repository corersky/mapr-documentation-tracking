          Memory Usage Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_MEMORY_SWAPPING

   Meaning
          The HostStats service raises this alarm for swap space when the
          delta of swap in memory and the delta of swap out memory exceeds
          the threshold set over a specific time period.

   Resolution
          To clear the alarm, you can increase the physical memory or
          reduce the load running on the node. You can run the service
          list command to see the memory allocated to each service on the
          node. See [1]service list for more information.

          The memory swapping alarm is controlled by the following
          properties in /opt/mapr/conf/hoststats.conf:

          + alarm.swapping.threshold
          + alarm.swapping.counter

          The memory threshold for swap in and swap out is defined by the
          alarm.swapping.threshold property, which is set to 100MB by
          default. The duration over which HostStats checks the delta of
          the memory is defined by the alarm.swapping.counter, which is
          set to 100 seconds by default.
