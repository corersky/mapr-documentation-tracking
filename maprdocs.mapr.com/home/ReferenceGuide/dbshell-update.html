dbshell update

Description

   Update operations are performed with mutations. These mutation
   operations are specified with sub-commands that are used to update and
   add document fields, or merge sub-documents to existing documents.
   Note: When a document mutation is specified with field paths that are
   overlapping and the conflict is detected, MapRDB's client-side encoding
   for the mutation discards the previous mutation at the node where the
   conflict is occurring and proceeds with the next mutation at that node.
   For example, if the existing document is:
{"_id":"id1", "a":{"b":{"c":5}}}

   You perform a mutation with overlapping fields:
update /tbl --id id1 --m {"$delete":"a.b","$set":{"a.b.d":10}}

   Where the desired result is:
{"_id":"id1", "a":{"b":{"d":"10"}}}

   The actual result is:
{"_id":"id1", "a":{"b":{"c":5,"d":"10"}}}

   In this case, the set operation on a.b.d causes the delete operation on
   a.b to be discarded by the client.

Parameters

   update Options Description
   *, --t, --table (Required) Table path
   --id (Required) Document ID. For rowID-only conditions, the rowID can
   be provided either within a condition payload or by using the --id
   switch. For example, --id id1 is equivalent to --c
   {"$eq":{"_id":"id1"}}
   Note: Repeating _ids with a switch and within a condition payload is
   not allowed.
   -m, --mutation (Required) JSON document containing fields and thier
   values.
   -c, --where Condition in JSON format. See [1]JSON Document Query
   Conditions Using OJAI Syntax for a description of the syntax.

Syntax

   update <table path> <parameter> {"<sub-command>": <operation> }

Sub-Commands for the --mutation option

   Each of the following sub-commands are used to modify multiple fields
   of a document at once. Fields of sub-commands can be provided either by
   an array, map, or value.
   Sub-Command Description
   $set The set command is used to update the field(s) of a document. $set
   is a read-modify-write operation where the type of the existing value
   validated at the specified FieldPath before applying the mutation. If
   the field does not exist in the corresponding document in the document
   store, it is created. If the field exists but is not of the same type
   as the type of new value, then the entire mutation fails. The list of
   field paths and values need to be provided as an array of
   comma-separated key-value pairs. If there is a single field path, array
   representation is not required.
   Note: The behavior of this command is the same as JSON
   DocumentMutation.set().
   $put The put command does not perform a read-modify-write operation. If
   a field exists, itâ€™s value is updated irrespective of original type.
   Therefore, you can update a field a.b from array to map. If the field
   does not exists, it is created with the given value.
   Note: The behavior of this command is same as OJAI
   DocumentMutation.setOrReplace().
   $delete The delete command needs a list of fieldpath(s) to be deleted.
   If the field exists, it is deleted. If the field does not exists, the
   operation succeeds silently.
   Note: The behavior of this command operation is same as OJAI
   DocumentMutation.delete().
   $increment The increment command is used to increment a field of
   numeric type. It will not change the type of an existing field. If
   there is a mismatch in the type of an intermediate field, the increment
   operation fails. For example, if you perform an increment operation on
   field a.b.c where a is an integer, the command fails. If the fieldpath
   does not exist, a new field is created with the value provided.
   Note: The behavior of this command is the same as JSON
   DocumentMutation.increment().
   $decrement The decrement command adds new fields in the document with a
   decrement value if the field does not exist. The command fails if there
   is a type mismatch in the intermediate field (similar behavior as
   $increment).
   Note: The behavior of this command is the same as JSON
   DocumentMutation.decrement().
   $append The append command is a read-modify-write type operation that
   is used to append a given value to an existing binary, string or array
   type field. If there is type mismatch in any intermediate field
   specified in fieldpath with that in the document, it fails with an
   error. For example, an append operation on field a.b.c fails if the
   field a itself is a scalar.
   Note: The behavior of this command is the same as OJAI
   DocumentMutation.append().
   $merge The merge command is used to merge a subdocument to an existing
   document. If the original document contains the same fields as the
   subdocument, the values are replaced. Otherwise, new fields with the
   given value are added. If there is a mismatch in type of target field
   between original document and input to the command, merge fails.
   Note: The behavior of this command is the same as OJAI
   DocumentMutation.merge().

Sample JSON Document

   The dbshell update examples use the following sample JSON document:
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
       "b": [{"boolean":false}, {"decimal": 123.456}],
       "c":{
             "d":10,
             "e":"Hello"
           }
       },
  "m":"MapR wins"
}

$set

   With this example, the document fields a.b[0].boolean, a.c.d and a.x
   are updated. The condition is on the rowkey. If the field does not
   exist, the update command creates and sets it. The update fails if the
   existing field type does not match. If the field exists and is the same
   type, the value is updated.
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
        "$set":[{"a.b[0].boolean":true},{"a.c.d":11},{"a.x":1}]
        }

   When this update operation is applied to the sample JSON document, the
   following is the resulting document:
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":true}, {"decimal": 123.456}],
        "c":{
              "d":11,
              "e":"Hello"
            },
        "x":1
       },

  "m":"MapR wins"
 }

   Note: If only one field is set, the command looks like the following:
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
          "$set": {"a.b[0].boolean":true}
          }

$put

   With this example, a put operation is performed. Similar to the set
   operation, an array representation is not required for a single field.
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
      "$put": [{"a.b[0].boolean":true},{"a.c.d":"eureka"},{"a.x":1}]
      }

   When this update operation is applied to the sample JSON document, the
   following is the resulting document:
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":true}, {"decimal": 123.456}],
        "c":{
              "d":"eureka",
              "e":"Hello"
            },
        "x":1
      },
  "m":"MapR wins"
}

$delete

   With the following example, the operation deletes multiple fieldpaths
   in the document at once.
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
      "$delete": ["a.b[1]","a.c.e"]
      }

   When this update operation is applied to the sample JSON document, the
   following is the resulting document:
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":false}],
        "c": {
              "d": 10
              }
        },
  "m": "MapR wins"
}

   The following example shows that if there is a single field to be
   deleted, the array can be skipped:
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
      "$delete":"a.b[1]"
      }

$merge

   With this example, a merge operation is performed.
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
      "$merge":{"a.c":{"d":11,"y":"yo"}}
      }

   When this update operation is applied to the sample JSON document, the
   following is the resulting document:
{
    "_id": "id1",
    "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":false}, {"decimal": 123.456}],
        "c":{
            "d":11,
            "e":"Hello",
            "y":"yo"
        }
    },
    "m":"MapR wins"
}

   Note: $merge does not support the array format for merging two maps at
   two different fieldpaths in the document.
   For example, the following syntax is not correct:
// WRONG Syntax
update /tbl --id id1 --m {"$merge":["a":{"b":1},{"a":{"d":"MapR"}}]}

   The following syntax is correct:
// CORRECT Syntax
update /tbl --id id1 --m {"$merge":{"a":{"b":1,"d":"MapR"}}}

   Alternatively, you can run the [2]update without using sub-commands:
// Alternative Syntax
update /tbl --id id1 --m {"a":{"b":1},"a":{"d":"MapR"}}

$increment

   With this example, an increment operation is performed.
     * If field p.q.r exists:
          + Increment the field by 1.
          + Otherwise, set the field to 1 (does not exist).
     * If field a.c.d exists:
          + Increment the field by 5.
          + Otherwise, set the field to 5 (does not exist).

   Note: If there are multiple fields, the value of $increment should be
   an array: "$increment":["p.q.r",{"a.c.d": 5}].
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
      "$increment":{"a.c.d":-5}
      }

   When this update operation is applied to the sample JSON document, the
   following is the resulting document:
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":false}, {"decimal": 123.456}],
        "c":{
              "d":5,
              "e":"Hello"
            }
        },
  "m":"MapR wins"
}

$decrement

   With this example, an decrement operation is performed.
     * If field p.q.r exists:
          + Decrement the field by 1.
          + Otherwise, set the field to -1 (does not exist).
     * If field a.c.d exists:
          + Decrement the field by 5.
          + Otherwise, set the field to -5 (does not exist).

   Note: Similar to the increment operation, a fieldpath can be provided
   without a value: "$decrement":["p.q.r",{"a.c.d":2}]
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
      "$decrement":{"a.c.d":5}
      }

   When this update operation is applied to the sample JSON document, the
   following is the resulting document:
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":false}, {"decimal": 123.456}],
        "c":{
              "d":-5,
              "e":"Hello"
            }
        },
  "m":"MapR wins"
}

$append

   With this example, an append operation is performed on fields a.b and
   a.c.e.
update /tbl --id id1 --m
     '{
      "$append":[{"a.b":{"appd":1}},{"a.c.e":" MapR"}]
      }'

   When this update operation is applied to the sample JSON document, the
   following is the resulting document:
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":false}, {"decimal": 123.456}, {"appd":1}],
        "c":{
              "d":10,
              "e":"Hello MapR"
            }
        },
  "m":"MapR wins"
}

Multiple Sub-commands Example

   A user can combine different sub-commands into a single JSON mutation
   in the shell. If multiple fieldpaths are provided and if there is a
   path conflict during runtime, exception errors will be thrown. This
   behavior is consistent with current OJAI API behavior.
   Note: If the document provided as a part of --m and --c has spaces,
   then it must be enclosed within single quotes.
// Syntax for combining different sub-commands

update /tbl --id id1 --m
        '{
        "$set":[{"a.b":<value>},â€¦],
        "$delete":["a.c.d",â€¦],
        "$merge":{...},
        "$increment":[....],
        "$append":[...]
        }'

   The following is an example of combining different sub-commands.
update /tbl --id id1 --m
        '{
        "$set":{"x":[1,2,3]},
        "$put":{"a.c.e":{"$binary":"AAAADg=="}},
        "$increment":"a.b[1].decimal",
        "$delete":"a.b[0]",
        "$merge":{"newDoc":{"k":"MapR DBShell rocks!!"}},
        "$append":{"m":"!!!"}
        }'

   The following is example output:
{
  "_id":"id1",
  "a":{
        "b":[{"decimal":124.456}],
        "c":{"d":10,"e":{"$binary":"AAAADg=="}}
      },
  "m":"MapR wins!!!",
  "newDoc":{"k":"MapR DBShell rocks!!"},
  "x":[1,2,3]
}

   The changes to the document operate in the following manner:
     * $set subcommand adds a new array [1,2,3] with fieldpath x into the
       document.
     * $put subcommand replaces the existing string "Hello" with a binary
       value {"$binary":"AAAADg=="}.
     * $delete subcommand deletes the fieldpath a.b[0] from the document.
     * $merge subcommand merges a new document {"newDoc":{"k":"MapR
       DBShell rocks!!"}}.
     * $append subcommand merges the strings "MapR wins" and "!!!"
       together.
     * $increment and $delete work on the array a.b which is an array but
       on different indices.
"$increment":"a.b[1].decimal"
"$delete":"a.b[0]"

   Important: The following operations are not recommended because the
   nature of execution is not guaranteed.
"$increment":"a.b[1].decimal"
"$delete":"a.b"

Update without Sub-commands

   As part of the update command, a subdocument can be merged with
   original document without using update sub-commands. When applying this
   type of update, the behavior is same as the merge command.

   For example:
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
      "k":"eureka",
      "a":{"c":{"d":1234}}
      }

   If the document with key "id1" exists, the subdocument within the
   update command is merged with the original document. If the document
   does not exist, a new document is created with the input provided.

   Application of the command above to sample document will result in
   following :
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":false}, {"decimal": 123.456}],
        "c":{
              "d":1234,
              "e":"Hello"
            }
        },
 "k":"eureka",
 "m":"MapR wins"
}

   Another example of the update command :
update /tbl --id id1 --m {
      "k":"eureka",
      "a":{"c":{"d":null}}
      }

   The resulting document will be :
{
  "_id": "id1",
  "a": {
        "b": [{"boolean":false}, {"decimal": 123.456}],
        "c":{
              "d":null,
              "e":"Hello"
             }
        },
  "k":"eureka",
  "m":"MapR wins"
}

   Note: In this example, field "a.c.d" remains in the document while
   being set to null.

Update with Condition and Logical Operator

   The rowid field can be either part of a condition or provided in the
   command line using the --id switch. More complex conditions can be
   selected by using logical operators ($and, $or) and comparison
   operators ($gt, $lt, $eq, etc.). A logical operator is defined in JSON
   documents with an array that contains a list of simple conditions.
   There are other types of condition operators that can be used.

   In this example, the mutation is applied to a document with a given
   rowid if the condition evaluates to true.
   Note: A command of this form is the same as OJAI checkAndUpdate().

   The following is an example of an update operation with complex
   conditions:
update  /tbl  --c {"$and":[
      {"$eq": {"_id" : "id1"}},
      {"$and":[
      {"$eq":{"a.b[0].boolean":false}},
      {"$or":[{"$ne":{"a.c.d":5}},
      {"$gt":{"a.b[1].decimal":1},"$lt":{"a.b[1].decimal":10}}
      ]}
      ]}
      ]
      }
      --m {<document mutation>}
