   Meaning
          A mirror operation failed.

   Resolution
          Make sure the CLDB is running on both the source cluster and the
          destination cluster. Look at the CLDB log
          (/opt/mapr/logs/cldb.log) and the MapR-FS log
          (/opt/mapr/logs/mfs.log) on both clusters for more information.
          If the attempted mirror operation was between two clusters, make
          sure that both clusters are reachable over the network. Make
          sure the source volume is available and reachable from the
          cluster that is performing the mirror operation.
