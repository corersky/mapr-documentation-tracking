table replica autosetup

   Sets up and starts replication between a source MapR-DB binary or JSON
   table to a replica MapR-DB binary or JSON table.

   The maprcli table replica autosetup command performs the following
   steps to set up replication:
    1. Creates a new table with metadata from the source table in the
       destination cluster.
    2. Declares the new table to be a replica of the source table and
       ensures that replication does not begin immediately after the next
       step.
    3. Declares the source table as an upstream source for the replica.
    4. For multi-master replication, replica autosetup declares the source
       table to be a replica of the new table and then declares the new
       table to be an upstream source for the source table.
    5. Loads a copy of the source data into the replica(s).
    6. Clears the paused replication state to start the replication
       stream.

   For more information about the automatic setup process, see [1]Replica
   Autosetup for MapR-DB Tables.
   Note: Before you set up replication for a table, verify that the
   cluster is setup for replication. For more information, see
   [2]Preparing Clusters for Table Replication.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [3]readAce and [4]writeAce on both the source volume and the target
       volume
     * [5]lookupdir on directories in the paths of both tables
     * readperm and replperm permissions on the source table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions

Parameters

   path

   The path to the source table that you want to replicate.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testsrc under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testsrc

     * For a path on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customersrc under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customersrc

   replica

   The path to the replica.
     * For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
       mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under a volume
       with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testdst
     * For a table on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customerdst
       undervolume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path: /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   Note: For replication to a table, the command will fail if the replica
   path you specify points to table that already exists.
   columns

   By default, all columns in the source table are replicated.
   If you do not want to replicate all columns in the table, you can
   specify specific columns to replicate:

   For binary tables
          Provide a comma-separated list of column families or columns
          from a certain column family (column family:qualifier). For
          example, use the following syntax to replicate the column family
          purchases and the column stars in the reviews column family:
          -columns purchases,reviews:stars

          Note: While the column families that you specify must already
          exist in the source table, the columns that you specify do not
          have to exist in the destination table for replication to
          succeed. If the column is added at a later date, replication for
          that column will start at that time.

   For JSON tables
          Provide a comma-delimited list of fields to replicate. Include
          the full field path for each field.

          Example

          Suppose your table contains documents that contain this general
          structure:

{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}

          To replicate fields a, c, and e, you would specify these field
          paths:

a,a.b.c,a.e

          Do not use quotation marks and do not include spaces after
          commas.

          Suppose now that a.b and a.e were custom column families. You
          want to replicate only the default column family and column
          family a.e. To do so, you would specify field paths like this:

",a.e"

          The empty string before the comma indicates the default column
          family.

   synchronous A Boolean value that specifies whether replication is
   synchronous or asynchronous. The values are true or false. Asynchronous
   (false) is the default.
   multimaster A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to set up a
   multi-master topology. The values are true or false. Basic master-slave
   topology (false) is the default.
   throttle A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to throttle
   replication operations. Throttle the replication stream to minimize the
   impact of the replication process on incoming operations during periods
   of heavy load. The values are true or false. No throttle (false) is the
   default.
   networkencryption A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to
   enable on-wire encryption. The values are true or false. No encryption
   (false) is the default. If you set this to true, the local cluster and
   any other cluster that is part of the replication process must be
   enabled for security.
   networkcompression

   The type of on-wire compression.

   The types are:
     * off
     * on (default)
     * lzf
     * lz4
     * zlib

   lz4 is the default compression which it set by parameter values on or
   lz4.
   directcopy A Boolean value that specifies whether or not autosetup will
   use the directcopy option . The values are true or false. Autosetup
   with direct copy (true) is the default. If you set this parameter to
   false, the cluster will run autosetup without the directcopy option.
   For more information, see [6]Replica Autosetup for MapR-DB Tables.
   Note: If a table was originally created in MapR 5.x and the maprcli
   table replica autosetup command is specified with directcopy=false,
   then an error, “Copy Table failed for tables”, occurs. This is due to
   the introduction of new table meta information in 6.0. It is
   recommended that replication be setup using directcopy=true (which is
   the default). If the default method is not desired, then replication
   should be setup manually.
   useexistingreplica When the directcopy parameter is set to true
   (default), this Boolean value specifies whether or not an existing
   table can be used as the replica table. The values for this parameter
   are true or false. No reuse of existing tables (false) is the default.
   If a table exists with the specified name, and this parameter is set to
   false, the create table operation will fail.
