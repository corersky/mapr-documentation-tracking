cldb.conf

   The file /opt/mapr/conf/cldb.conf specifies configuration parameters
   for the CLDB and for cluster topology.

   Field

   Default

   Description

   cldb.containers.cache.entries
   1000000 The maximum number of read/write containers available in the
   CLDB cache.

   cldb.default.topology
   /data The default topology for newly-created volumes.

   cldb.detect.dup.hostid.enabled
   false When true, CLDB will disable all nodes with duplicate hostid,
   including new nodes that try to register with duplicate hostid and the
   existing node. Alarm NODE_ALARM_DUPLICATE_HOSTID is raised. This case
   requires admin intervention to correct the hostid confusion. If
   duplicate hostid occurs on nodes running CLDB, the cluster may fail to
   start in which case the alarm will not get raised, but the cldb.log
   file in /opt/mapr/logs/ will contain an error message.

   cldb.ignore.stale.zk
   false When this setting is true, the CLDB ignores the ZooKeeper's
   information regarding the most recent copy of CLDB data. Change this
   setting to true when the ZooKeeper information is stale. Restart the
   CLDB with this setting. After the CLDB starts, change the setting back
   to false then restart the CLDB again.
   Note: Only change this setting on CLDB nodes that are known to have the
   most recent copy of the CLDB data. Shut down all CLDB processes before
   changing this variable.

   cldb.jmxremote.port
   7220 The CLDB JMX remote port

   cldb.min.fileservers
   1 Number of fileservers that must register with the CLDB before the
   root volume is created

   cldb.numthreads
   10 The number of threads reserved for use by the CLDB.

   cldb.port
   7222 The port on which the CLDB listens.
   cldb.v2.features.enabled 1 Enables new features added in MapR version
   2.0. Used only during the upgrade process from v1.x to 2.x to control
   when new features become active. Once enabled, cannot be disabled.
   cldb.v3.features.enabled 1 Enables new features added in MapR version
   3.0. Used only during the upgrade process from a pre-3.0 version to
   control when new features become active. Once enabled, cannot be
   disabled.
   cldb.web.port 7221 The port the CLDB uses for the webserver.
   cldb.zookeeper.servers The nodes that are running ZooKeeper, in the
   format \<host:port\>.
   hadoop.version The version of Hadoop supported by the cluster.
   net.topology.script.file.name The path to a script that associates IP
   addresses with physical topology paths. The script takes the IP address
   of a single node as input and returns the physical topology that should
   be associated with the specified node. This association is used only at
   the time a node is initially added to the cluster. To change topology
   for nodes already in the cluster, use the maprcli [1]node move command.
   net.topology.table.file.name The path to a text file that associates IP
   addresses with physical topology paths. Each line of the text file is
   of format "<hostname/ip> <rack>", with the IP address or hostname of
   one node, followed by the topology to associate with the node. This
   association is used only at the time a node is initially added to the
   cluster. To change topology for nodes already in the cluster, use the
   maprcli [2]node move command.
   net.topology.script.file.name The path to a script that associates IP
   addresses with physical topology paths. The script takes the IP address
   of a single node as input and returns the physical topology that should
   be associated with the specified node. This association is used only at
   the time a node is initially added to the cluster. To change topology
   for nodes already in the cluster, use the maprcli [3]node move command.
   num.volmirror.threads 1 The number of (volume mirror) threads to create
   to process mirroring requests. The specified number of threads will be
   created to process requests in parallel; the remaining requests will be
   in the queue till they are picked up by volume mirror thread.
   cldb.enable.memory.tracker false Utility that monitors CLDB for memory
   usage and deadlocks. If true, memory allocations in CLDB is tracked and
   if memory usage of CLDB goes above certain limits, it generates core
   and shuts down. Memory limit is configured as:
Xmx+non heap memory costant(default:3072MB)

   Note: Non-heap memory usage can be changed by setting the value for
   CLDB configuration parameter cldb.memory.max.nonheap.mb to any custom
   value.
   If CLDB memory usage goes beyond 130% of this limit, the utility dumps
   and shuts down CLDB. The default value is false.

Example cldb.conf file

#
# CLDB Config file.
# Properties defined in this file are loaded during startup
# and are valid for only CLDB which loaded the config.
# These parameters are not persisted anywhere else.
#
# Wait until minimum number of fileserver register with
# CLDB before creating Root Volume
cldb.min.fileservers=1
# CLDB listening port
cldb.port=7222
# Number of worker threads
cldb.numthreads=10
# CLDB webport
cldb.web.port=7221
# CLDB https port
cldb.web.https.port=7443
# Disable duplicate hostid detection
cldb.detect.dup.hostid.enabled=false
# Deprecated: This param is no longer supported. To configure
# the container cache, use the param cldb.containers.cache.percent
# Number of RW containers in cache
#cldb.containers.cache.entries=1000000
#
# Percentage (integer) of Xmx setting to be used for container cache
#cldb.containers.cache.percent=20
#
# Topology script to be used to determine
# Rack topology of node
# Script should take an IP address as input and print rack path
# on STDOUT. eg
# $>/home/mapr/topo.pl 10.10.10.10
# $>/mapr-rack1
# $>/home/mapr/topo.pl 10.10.10.20
# $>/mapr-rack2
#net.topology.script.file.name=/home/mapr/topo.pl
#
# Topology mapping file used to determine
# Rack topology of node
# File is of a 2 column format (space separated)
# 1st column is an IP address or hostname
# 2nd column is the rack path
# Line starting with '#' is a comment
# Example file contents
# 10.10.10.10 /mapr-rack1
# 10.10.10.20 /mapr-rack2
# host.foo.com /mapr-rack3
#net.topology.table.file.name=/home/mapr/topo.txt
#
# ZooKeeper address
cldb.zookeeper.servers=10.10.82.22:5181
# Hadoop metrics jar version
hadoop.version=2.7.0
# CLDB JMX remote port
cldb.jmxremote.port=7220
num.volmirror.threads=1
# Set this to set the default topology for all volumes and nodes
# The default for all volumes is /data by default
# UNCOMMENT the below to change the default topology.
# For e.g., set cldb.default.topology=/mydata to create volumes
# in /mydata topology and to place all nodes in /mydata topology
# by default
#cldb.default.topology=/mydata
enable.replicas.invariant.check=false
