Overview

   Each command reference page includes the command syntax, a table that
   describes the parameters, and examples of command usage.

   In each parameter table, required parameters are in bold text. For
   output commands, the reference pages include tables that describe the
   output fields. Values that do not apply to particular combinations are
   marked NA.
