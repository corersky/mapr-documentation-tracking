Sample Output

   With the -detail parameter:
# maprcli stream assign list -path /s1 -json -detail
{
        "timestamp":1441965109585,
        "timeofday":"2015-09-11 02:51:49.585 GMT-0700",
        "status":"OK",
        "total":1,
        "data":[
                {
                        "consumergroup":"xyzt1",
                        "topic":"topic1",
                        "assignseqnum":1,
                        "consumerguid":"F3693413-2600-0876-CC91-052FA4F25500",
                        "consumer":"ravindra.perf",

                        "consumerpid":"30768",
                        "assignment":"0,1,2,3"
                }
        ]
}

   Without the -detail parameter:
# maprcli stream assign list -path /s1 -json
{
        "timestamp":1441965116100,
        "timeofday":"2015-09-11 02:51:56.100 GMT-0700",
        "status":"OK",
        "total":1,
        "data":[
                {
                        "consumergroup":"xyzt1",
                        "topic":"topic1",
                        "consumer":"ravindra.perf",
                        "consumerip":"10.10.30.200",
                        "consumerpid":"30768",
                        "assignment":"0,1,2,3"
