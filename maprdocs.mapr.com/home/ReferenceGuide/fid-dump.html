   that are identified by an FID.
   Note: Only the root user and the MAPR_USER user (user under which MapR
   services runs) have permissions to run this command.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli fid dump
   [ -cluster <cluster_name> ]
   -fid <file identified for the element>

   REST
          N/A

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   cluster The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is
   omitted, the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.
   fid The file identifier for the element (region, kvstore, etc.) for
   which you want detailed information. The output of [1]maprcli table
   region list lists the FIDs for the table's regions.
   Note: You can run this command on any FID available on the MapR-FS.
