stream edit

   Edits the values of parameters for the specified stream.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm permission on the stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path The path and name of the stream to create.
   ttl Specifies the number of seconds to elapse between the publication
   of a message in a topic in this stream and the expiration of that
   message.

   Consumers do not see messages that have expired.

   Messages that have expired are deleted during the next purge process.
   See [4]Time-to-Live for Messages for details.

   A value of 0 causes messages to be retained indefinitely.
   autocreate Specifies whether to create a topic automatically when a
   producer tries to write the first message to it. Values are true and
   false. The default is true.
   defaultpartitions Specifies the default number of partitions to
   allocate to new topics in the stream.
   compression

   Specifies the compression setting to use for the stream. Producer
   client libraries can bundle messages that are to be published on the
   same partition and compress them. The messages are sent to the server
   compressed, are stored compressed, are replicated to other containers
   compressed, and (if stream replication is configured) replicated to
   replica streams compressed. Consumer client libraries receive
   compressed data, decompresses it, and passes it to client applications.

   Valid options are off, lzf, lz4, and zlib. The default setting is the
   type of compression that is set for the directory in which the stream
   is located.

   For more information, see [5]Compression.
   produceperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who
   can publish messages to topics in the stream. See [6]ACE Syntax.
   consumeperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who
   can who can listen to topics in the stream. See [7]ACE Syntax.
   topicperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who can
   create, edit, or remove topics in the stream. See [8]ACE Syntax.
   copyperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who can
   use mapr copystream or mapr diffstreams on the stream. See [9]ACE
   Syntax.
   adminperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who can
   can modify the other access-control expressions for the stream, set up
   replication from the stream, and modify attributes of the stream. See
   [10]ACE Syntax.

   This permission includes the topicperm permission.
   defaulttimestamptype Specifies the type of timestamp stored in the
   topic's message. Value: createtime | logappendtime Default: createtime.
   The topic inherits the default value from the stream unless the topic
   sets the timestamp type to a different value.

   A createtime value is the time defined by the user or application (when
   creating the message). If user or application does not define this
   value (or passes null), the client uses the current system timestamp.

   A logappendtime value is the time when the message (log) was appended
   to the server.
