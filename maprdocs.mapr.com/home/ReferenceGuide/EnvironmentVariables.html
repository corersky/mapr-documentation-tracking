Environment Variables

   The following table describes environment variables specific to MapR.
   For MapR 6.0 and later, environment variables should be set in
   /opt/mapr/conf/env_override.sh. Editing /opt/mapr/conv/env.sh is no
   longer recommended. For more information, see [1]About env_override.sh.

   Variable

   Example Values

   Description
   CLDB_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT 5000 If clients outside the cluster cannot reach
   CLDB on the default port, use the CLDB_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT environment
   variable to specify the port on which CLDB can be reached.
   JAVA_HOME /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-sun The directory where the correct
   version of Java is installed.
   MAPR_HOME /opt/mapr (default) The directory in which MapR is installed.
   MAPR_EXTERNAL 10.10.123.25,10.10.123.30 If your cluster nodes have
   multiple NICs, use the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable to grant
   external clients access to a cluster node on specific IP addresses. The
   value of the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable on a node is a
   comma-separated list of up to four IP addresses with no spaces.
   MAPR_SUBNETS 10.10.123.0/24,10.10.124.0/24 If you do not want MapR to
   use all NICs on each node, use the environment variable MAPR_SUBNETS to
   restrict MapR traffic to specific NICs. Set MAPR_SUBNETS to a
   comma-separated list of up to four subnets in CIDR notation with no
   spaces. If MAPR_SUBNETS is not set, MapR uses all NICs present on the
   node. When MAPR_SUBNETS is set, make sure the node can reach all nodes
   in the cluster (servers and clients) using the specified subnets.
   MAPR_USER mapr (default) Used with [2]configure.sh to specify the user
   under which MapR runs its services. If not explicitly set, it defaults
   to the user mapr. After configure.sh is run, the value is stored in
   [3]daemon.conf .
   MAPR_ECOSYSTEM_LOGIN_OPTS *hybrid* Specifies the JAAS configuration to
   use with installed open source components.
