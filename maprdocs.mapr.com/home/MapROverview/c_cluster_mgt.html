Cluster Management

   MapR provides high availability management and data processing services
   for automatic continuity throughout the cluster. You can use the MapR
   Control System, command-line interface, or REST API to start, stop, and
   monitor services at the node or cluster level. MapReduce services such
   as the ResourceManager, management services such as the ZooKeeper, and
   data access services such as NFS provide continuous service during any
   system failure.

   [1]MapR Monitoring (part of the Spyglass initiative) provides the
   ability to collect, store, and view metrics and logs for nodes,
   services, and jobs/applications.

   This section describes the following components and services, and also
   describes their roles in managing a MapR cluster:
