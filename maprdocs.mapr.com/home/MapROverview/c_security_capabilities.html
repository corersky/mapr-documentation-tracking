Security Capabilities

   Describes authentication, authorization, and encryption capabilities. A
   secure MapR environment is predicated on authentication, authorization,
   and encryption capabilities.

   Authentication
          Restricting access to a specified set of users. Robust
          authentication prevents third parties from representing
          themselves as legitimate users.

   Authorization
          Restricting an authenticated user's capabilities on the system.
          Flexible authorization systems enable a system to grant a user a
          set of capabilities that enable the user to perform desired
          tasks, but prevents the use of any capabilities outside of that
          scope.

   Encryption
          Restricting an external party's ability to read data. Data
          transmission between nodes in a secure MapR cluster is
          encrypted, preventing an attacker with access to that
          communication from gaining information about the transmission's
          contents.
