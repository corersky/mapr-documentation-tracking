Understanding Topology

   The MapR software uses node topology to determine the location of
   replicated copies of data. Node topology describes the locations of
   nodes and racks in a cluster. Cluster topology can be defined by
   specifying a topology for each node in the cluster. You can use
   topology to group nodes by rack or switch, depending on how the
   physical cluster is arranged and how you want MapR to place replicated
   data. When cluster topology is optimally defined, data is replicated to
   separate racks, which provides continued data availability in the event
   of rack or node failure.

   Topology paths can be as simple or complex as needed to correspond to
   your cluster layout. In a simple cluster, each topology path might
   consist of the rack only (for example, /rack-1). In a deployment
   consisting of multiple datacenters, each topology path can be much
   longer (eg, europe/uk/london/DC2/room4/row22/rack5/). MapR uses
   topology paths to spread out replicated copies of data, placing each
   copy on a separate path. By setting each path to correspond to a
   physical rack, you can ensure that replicated data is distributed
   across racks to improve fault tolerance.
