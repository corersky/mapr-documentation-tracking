MapReduce Version 2

   YARN dynamically allocates resources for applications as they execute.
   The MapReduce version 1 (MRv1) has been rewritten to run as an
   application on top of YARN; this new version is called MapReduce
   version 2.0 (MRv2).

   The main advancement in YARN architecture is the separation of resource
   management and job management, which were both handled by the same
   process (the JobTracker) in Hadoop 1.x. Cluster resources and job
   scheduling are managed by the ResourceManager, and resource negotiation
   and job monitoring are managed by an ApplicationMaster for each
   application running on the cluster. In MapReduce, each node advertises
   a relatively fixed number of map slots and reduce slots. This can lead
   to resource under-utilization, for example, when there is a heavy
   reduce load and map slots are available, because the map slots cannot
   accept reduce tasks (and vice versa).

   YARN generalizes resource management for use by new engines and
   frameworks, allowing resources to be allocated and reallocated for
   different concurrent applications sharing a cluster. Existing MapReduce
   applications can run on YARN without any changes. At the same time,
   because MapReduce is now merely another application on YARN, MapReduce
   is free to evolve independently of the resource management
   infrastructure.
