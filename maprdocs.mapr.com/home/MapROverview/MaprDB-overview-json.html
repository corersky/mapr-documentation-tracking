MapR-DB as a Document Database

   MapR-DB supports JSON documents as a native data store. A JSON document
   is a tree of fields. These JSON documents are stored in MapR-DB tables.

   MapR-DB as a document database, implements JSON documents in MapR-DB
   JSON tables.
     * MapR-DB JSON tables use the OJAI data model and support the OJAI
       API.
     * Documents are in JSON format; MapR-DB stores them in an efficient
       binary encoding, rather than plain ASCII text.
     * With JSON tables, each value has a unique key (_id). You identify
       fields in the document using field paths. For example,
       address.street:
{
    "_id": "ID001",
    "name" : "Bob",
    "address": {
        "house" : 123,
        "street": "Main",
        "phones": [
            { "mobile": "555-1234" },
            { "work": "+1-123-456-7890" }]},
    "hobbies": ["badminton", "chess", "beaches"]
}
       Note: Each JSON document can have different fields.

   With JSON document support, you can:
     * Store data that is hierarchical and nested, and evolves over time.
     * Read and write individual document fields, subsets of fields, or
       whole documents from and to disk. To update individual fields or
       subsets of fields, there is no need to read entire documents,
       modify them, and then write the modified documents to disk.
     * Build applications with the MapR-DB JSON API library, which is an
       implementation of the [1]Open JSON Application Interface (OJAI).
       This is an API library for easily managing complex, evolving,
       hierarchical data. You can use more data types than the standard
       types that JSON supports, create complex queries, and access JSON
       table documents without connection or configuration objects. This
       allows large-scale applications to manage JSON documents.
     * Filter query results within MapR-DB before results are returned to
       client applications.
     * Run client applications on Linux, OS X, and Windows systems.
     * Perform complex data analysis on your JSON data with [2]Apache
       Drill or other analytical tools in real time without having to copy
       data to another cluster.
     * Scale your data to span thousands of nodes.
     * Control read and write access to single fields and subsets of
       fields within a JSON table by using access-control expressions
       (ACEs).
     * Control the disk layout of single fields and subdocuments within
       JSON tables.
     * Use [3]Secondary Indexes to improve query performance.
