Architecture

   MapR-DB is an enterprise-grade, high performance, NoSQL (“Not Only
   SQL”) database management system. It is used to add real-time,
   operational analytics capabilities to big data applications. As a
   multi-model NoSQL database, it supports both JSON document models and
   wide column data models.
   MapR-DB is implemented as a log-based database within the framework of
   MapR-FS. As a log-based database, periodically, logged operations must
   be written to disk. In MapR-DB, table regions (also called tablets) and
   smaller structures within them are stored partially as b-trees which
   together with write-ahead log (WAL) files comprise log-structured-merge
   trees. Write-ahead logs for the smaller structures within regions are
   periodically restructured by rolling merge operations on the b-trees.
   Because MapR-DB performs these merges at small scales, applications
   running against MapR-DB see no significant effects on latency while the
   merges are taking place.
   Note: Apache HBase also uses the term regions. Apache HBase is
   deprecated.

Why use MapR-DB?

     * Integrated analytics with SQL: Integration with Drill for MapR
       provides a low-latency distributed SQL-like query engine for
       large-scale datasets, including structured and
       semi-structured/nested data.
     * Operational analytics: MapR-DB can be run in the same cluster as
       Apache™ Hadoop® and Apache Spark, letting you immediately analyze
       or process live, interactive data. Data silos can also be
       eliminated to speed the data-to-action cycle, while also enabling a
       more efficient data architecture.
     * Global distribution of applications: Application access to MapR-DB
       tables is distributable on a global scale.
     * Flexible data model: MapR-DB can be used as both a document
       database and a wide-column database. As a document database, JSON
       documents are stored in MapR-DB JSON tables. As a wide-column
       database, binary files are in stored MapR-DB binary tables.

How is MapR-DB related to MapR-FS?

   MapR-DB tables are implemented directly in the MapR file system
   (MapR-FS) where Mapr-DB tables (both binary and JSON tables) are
   created in logical units called volumes.

What Design Factors are Important?

     * Rowkey Optimization: The design of a table's rowkeys affects the
       speed at which client applications can access data and the database
       performance if hotspotting occurs. The better the design, the
       faster the data access. See [1]Table Rowkey Design for more
       information.
     * Column Family Optimization: Column families enable you to group
       related sets of data and restrict queries to a defined subset,
       leading to better performance. When you design a column family,
       think about what kinds of queries are going to be used the most
       often, and group your columns accordingly. See [2]Column Families
       in JSON Tables and [3]Column Families in Binary Tables for more
       information.
     * Replication Implementation: The design of table replication (in
       addition to the automatic replication that occures with table
       regions within a volume) depends on your desired outcome and the
       complexity of your environment. See [4]Table Replication for more
       implementation.
     * Security Implementation: Security can be implemented at many
       different levels including for table replication, JSON documents,
       and general access. Determining what level and where is part of the
       architectural design. See [5]Security on JSON Tables, [6]Security
       and Replication, and [7]Security.
