Security

   Using Hadoop as an enterprise-level tool requires data protection and
   disaster recovery capabilities in the cluster. As the amount of
   enterprise-critical data that resides in the cluster increases, the
   need for securing access becomes just as critical.

   Since data must be shared between nodes on the cluster, data
   transmissions between nodes and from the cluster to the client are
   vulnerable to interception. Networked computers are also vulnerable to
   attacks where an intruder successfully pretends to be another
   authorized user and then acts improperly as that user. Additionally,
   networked machines share the security vulnerabilities of a single node.

   The MapR Converged Data Platform provides authentication,
   authorization, and encryption services to protect the data in your
   cluster. MapR leverages Linux pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to
   support the main authentication protocols out of the box. A MapR
   cluster can authenticate users through LDAP/AD, NIS, or any other
   service that has a PAM module.

   For authorization, MapR provides Access Control Lists (ACLs) for job
   queues, volumes, and the cluster as a whole. Because MapR supports
   POSIX permissions on files and directories, MapR-FS performs permission
   checks on each file access. Other Hadoop distributions only check
   permissions on file open. MapR clusters also incorporate wire-level
   security (WLS) to encrypt data transmission for traffic within the
   cluster, as well as traffic between the cluster and client machines.
   MapR leverages the Hadoop Fair Scheduler to ensure fair allocation of
   resources to different users.
