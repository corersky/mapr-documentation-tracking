6.0 Platform

   MapR is a complete enterprise-grade distribution for Apache Hadoop. The
   MapR Converged Data Platform has been engineered to improve Hadoop’s
   reliability, performance, and ease of use.

   The MapR distribution provides a full Hadoop stack that includes the
   MapR File System (MapR-FS), the MapR-DB NoSQL database management
   system, MapR-ES, the MapR Control System (MCS) user interface, and a
   full family of Hadoop ecosystem projects. You can use MapR with Apache
   Hadoop, HDFS, and MapReduce APIs.

   MapR supports the Hadoop 2.x architecture and YARN (Yet Another
   Resource Negotiator). Hadoop 2.x and YARN make up a resource management
   and scheduling framework that distributes resource management and job
   management duties.

   Hadoop 2.x was designed to solve two main problems in the Hadoop 1.x
   architecture:
     * Centralization of job scheduling, resulting in scheduler
       bottlenecks
     * Separating resource management from application programming
       concerns

   Here is a high-level view of the MapR Converged Data Platform, showing
   its main components and supported ecosystem projects:

   This system overview contains architectural details about the
   components that run on the MapR Data Platform, how the components
   assemble into a cluster, and the relationships between the components.

   The MapR distribution provides several unique features that address
   common concerns with Apache Hadoop:
   Issue Addressed by MapR Feature Apache Hadoop
   Data Protection MapR Snapshots provide complete recovery capabilities.
   MapR Snapshots are rapid point-in-time consistent snapshots for both
   files and tables. MapR Snapshots make efficient use of storage and CPU
   resources, storing only changes from the point the snapshot is taken.
   You can configure schedules for MapR Snapshots with easy to use but
   powerful scheduling tools. Snapshot-like capabilities are not
   consistent, require application changes to make consistent, and may
   lead to data loss in certain situations.
   Security With wire-level security, data transmissions to, from, and
   within the cluster are encrypted, and strong authorization mechanisms
   enable you to tailor the actions a given user is able to perform.
   Authentication is robust without burdening end-users. Permissions for
   users are checked on each file access. Permissions for users are
   checked on file open only.
   Disaster Recovery MapR provides business continuity and disaster
   recovery services out of the box with mirroring that’s simple to
   configure and makes efficient use of your cluster’s storage, CPU, and
   bandwidth resources. No standard mirroring solution. Scripts based on
   distcp quickly become hard to administer and manage. No
   enterprise-grade consistency.
   Enterprise Integration With high-availability Direct Access NFS, data
   ingestion to your cluster can be made as simple as mounting an NFS
   share to the data source. Support for Hadoop ecosystem projects like
   Flume or Sqoop means minimal disruptions to your existing workflow.
   Performance MapR uses customized units of I/O, chunking, resync, and
   administration. These architectural elements allow MapR clusters to run
   at speeds close to the maximum allowed by the underlying hardware. In
   addition, the DirectShuffle technology leverages the performance
   advantages of MapR-FS to deliver strong cluster performance, and Direct
   Access NFS simplifies data ingestion and access. MapR-DB tables,
   available with the M7 license, are natively stored in the file system
   and support the Apache HBase API. MapR-DB tables provide the fastest
   and easiest to administer NoSQL solution on Hadoop. Stock Apache
   Hadoop’s NFS cannot read or write to an open file.
   Scalable Architecture (without single points of failure) The MapR
   Converged Data Platform provides High Availability for the Hadoop
   components in the stack. MapR clusters don’t use NameNodes and provide
   stateful high-availability for the MapReduce ResourceManager and Direct
   Access NFS. Works out of the box with no special configuration
   required. NameNode HA provides failover, but no failback, while
   limiting scale and creating complex configuration challenges. NameNode
   federation adds new processes and parameters to provide cumbersome,
   error-prone file federation.

Get Started

   Now that you know a bit about how the features of MapR Converged Data
   Platform work, take a quick tour to see for yourself how they can work
   for you:
     * MapR Sandbox for Hadoop: Try out a single-node cluster that's ready
       to roll, right out of the box!
     * MapR Installer: Use the MapR Installer to set up a production
       cluster, large or small.
