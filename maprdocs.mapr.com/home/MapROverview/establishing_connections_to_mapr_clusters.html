How MapR Client Connects to the Cluster

   The MapR client connects to the cluster via CLDB nodes. When a
   connection attempt fails, the MapR client returns an error. When an
   existing connection is no longer available, the MapR client attempts to
   reconnect to a CLDB node.

   For information about installing the MapR client, see [1]MapR Client.

How the MapR Client Establishes Connections to the Cluster

   Client applications connect to a cluster via CLDB nodes, which are
   listed in the connection request or in the mapr-clusters.conf file on
   the node that submits the connection request. When a client application
   attempts to connect to the cluster for the first time, the following
   scenarios can occur:
     * At least one of the CLDB nodes is online, in which case the
       connection is successful.
     * None of the CLDB nodes are online, in which case the connection
       attempt fails.
     * The CLDB nodes are listed incorrectly (e.g. the IP addresses are
       incorrect), in which case the connection attempt fails.

   When a connection attempt fails, the MapR client returns one of the
   following errors based on the application type:
   Application Type Error
   C Application using HBase API ErrorCode = 1.
   C Applications using HDFS API NULL handle
   Java Application using HBase, OJAI, or MapR-FS API java.io.IOException:
   Could not create FileClient
   Java Application using Kafka API for MapR-ES
   org.apache.kafka.common.errors.NetworkException.

How the MapR Client Re-establishes Failed Connections to the Cluster

   If the CLDB goes down after a client application establishes its first
   connection to MapR, the MapR client's behavior depends on the setting
   for the fs.mapr.hardmount property in the core-site.xml file in the
   client installation directory.
     * If fs.mapr.hardmount is set to true, the MapR client hangs as it
       continuously attempts to reconnect to the CLDB. The MapR client
       stops hanging when the CLDB is brought back online. This is the
       default behavior.
     * If fs.mapr.hardmount is set to false, the MapR client attempts to
       connect to each CLDB node that is listed in the mapr-clusters.conf
       file on the node that submitted the connection request. If all of
       the CLDB nodes are down, the MapR client returns the error
       EAGAIN/-EAGAIN to the client application. This error indicates that
       a connection could not be established because the CLDB nodes were
       not available or because the request timed out due to reasons, such
       as heavy traffic caused the network to be slow or other nodes were
       unavailable.
