Managing Hive Metastore

   The Hive Metastore is started automatically by the warden at
   installation time if the mapr-hivemetastore package is installed. It is
   sometimes necessary to start or stop the service (for example, after
   changing the configuration). You can start and stop Hive Metastore in
   two ways:
     * Using the maprcli node services command - Using this command, you
       can start Hive Metastore on multiple nodes at one time.
     * Using the MapR Control System
