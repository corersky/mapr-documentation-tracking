User Impersonation for Hive

   User impersonation enables Hive to submit jobs as a particular user.
   Without impersonation, Hive submits queries and hadoop commands as the
   user that started HiveServer2 and Hive Metastore. On a MapR cluster,
   this user is typically the mapr user or the user specified in the
   MAPR_USER [1]environment variable.
   Note: Impersonation is enabled by default.
