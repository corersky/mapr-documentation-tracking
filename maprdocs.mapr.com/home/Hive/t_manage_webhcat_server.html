Managing the WebHCat Server

   As of Hive 0.13-1504 and Hive 1.0-1504, WebHCat is managed by Warden.
   Therefore, you can start and stop WebHCat using maprcli and the MapR
   Control System (MCS).

Starting the WebHCat Server

   Applies to versions prior to Hive 0.13-1504 and Hive 1.0-1504:
# ./webhcat_server.sh start

Starting WebHCat Using the maprcli

    1. Make a list of nodes on which Hive Metastore is configured.
    2. Issue the maprcli node services command:
maprcli node services -name hcat -action start -nodes <space delimited list of n
odes>

Stopping WebHCat Using the maprcli

    1. Make a list of nodes on which Hive Metastore is configured.
    2. Issue the maprcli node services command:
maprcli node services -name hcat -action stop -nodes <space delimited list of no
des>

Starting or Stopping WebHCat Using the MapR Control System

    1. In the Navigation pane, expand the Cluster Views pane and click
       Dashboard.
    2. In the Services pane, click WebHcat to open the Nodes screen
       displaying all the nodes on which Hive Metastore is configured.
    3. On the Nodes screen, click the hostname of each node to display its
       Node Properties screen.
    4. On each Node Properties screen, use the Stop/Start button in the
       WebHcat row under Manage Node Services to start WebHcat.

Checking the Error Logs

   Go to the following folder:
/opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/logs/<user.name>/webhcat

   Note: If you are running a Hive 0.13 version prior Hive 0.13-1504, go
   to the /tmp/<user.name>/webhcat folder to view the error logs.

Verifying the Server's Status

   In a web browser, navigate to:
 http://hostname:50111/templeton/v1/status?user.name=root

   A healthy server will return the string {"status":"ok","version":"v1"}.
   You can change the port number from the default value of 50111 by
   editing the webhcat-site.xml file.
