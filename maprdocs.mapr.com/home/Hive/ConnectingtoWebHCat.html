Connecting to WebHCat

   The method that WebHCat clients use to connect to WebHCat is based on
   the WebHCat Authentication method:
   WebHCat Authentication Connection Requirements
   Simple Clients pass the username as the user.name parameter in the REST
   call. No password is required. Example:
http://<hostname>:50111/templeton/v1/ddl/database/default/table/table01?user.nam
e=juser

   PAM Clients enter username and password authentication through a pop-up
   dialog box in the web browser session.
   Kerberos with SPNEGO Clients can use one of the following methods:
     * curl example:
curl --negotiate -i -u : 'http://<FQDN>:50111/templeton/v1/ddl/database/'
     * Web browser with user name and password. For more information, see
       [1]Configuring SPNEGO on MapR

   Note: With either method you must also have a Kerberos ticket in the
   cache. See [2]Example: Generating a Kerberos Ticket
