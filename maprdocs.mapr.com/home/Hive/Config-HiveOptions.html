Hive Security Configuration Options

   This section describes changes made in Hive default configuration. It
   shows how to configure Hive after manual installation.

   Unlike the previous releases, starting in MEP 4.0, Hive should be
   configured by running the $MAPR_HOME/server/configure.sh script with
   the -R option immediately after installing Hive. Hive demons will not
   start automatically if Hive is not configured correctly. The security
   configuration are described in the following sections:
    1. Manual
    2. Automatic
    3. Custom

   Note: Do not use ecosystem $HIVE_HOME/bin/configure.sh script for Hive
   configuration. Every configuration of Hive should be done via the
   $MAPR_HOME/server/configure.sh uitlity by running it with the -R
   option. The core $MAPR_HOME/server/configure.sh uitlity invokes the
   ecosystem configure.sh script automatically with appropriate security
   option.

Automatic

   If you installed Hive using the MapR Installer, the MapR Installer
   configures Hive daemons during installation. Additional configuration
   is not required.

Manual

   After a new manual installation, to generate a valid default ecosystem
   configuration, run:
$MAPR_HOME/server/configure.sh -R

   CAPTION: Table 1. Example: Hive is installed with the following
   configuration on a secure cluster

   Node, Package Hive HiveServer2 Hive Metastore WebHCat
   Node 1        X    X
   Node 2        X                X
   Node 3        X                               X
     * After a manual installation, run the following command on Node 1,
       Node 2, and Node 3:

   $MAPR_HOME/server/configure.sh -R

   As a result:
     * All Hive daemons are configured to support MapR-SASL. If the
       hive.metastore.sasl.enabled property is enabled in the
       hive-site.xml file, its value is set to true. If the property is
       not present, it is added in the configuration section as follows:
<property>
   <name>hive.metastore.sasl.enabled</name>
   <value>true</value>
</property>
     * HiveServer2 is configured to support encryption between Hiveserer2
       and Hive clients. If the hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop property is
       available in the hive-site.xml file, its value is set to auth-conf.
       If the property is not present, it is added in the configuration
       section as follows:
<property>
   <name>hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop</name>
   <value>auth-conf</value>
</property>
     * The configure.sh script creates a backup folder for the current
       Hive configuration before it changes the configuration. All
       configuration properties including *.conf, *.properties, and *.xml
       are saved in the backup folder.
$HIVE_HOME/conf.YYYYMMDD_HHMMS
     * The Hive default ports listed below are verified as available. If a
       port is not available, the configure.sh script generates an error
       message during configuration.

   Hive default ports are as follows:
        Role      Default Port
   Hive Metastore 9083
   HiveServer2    10000
   HiveWebHCat    50111

Custom

   For PAM, LDAP, and Kerberos custom configurations, run configure.sh
   with the -R option:
$MAPR_HOME/server/configure.sh -R

   The hive-site.xml file is not changed. However, Warden files are copied
   and a HIVE_HOME/conf backup folder is created.
