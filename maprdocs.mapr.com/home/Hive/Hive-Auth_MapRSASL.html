Configure MapR-SASL Authentication for HiveServer 2

   MapR-SASL is available starting with the 1504 release of Hive 0.13 and
   Hive 1.0. However, the configuration requirements for MapR-SASL differ
   based on the version of Hive that you have installed:
     * As of Hive 0.13-1501, Hive 1.0-1510, and Hive 1.2-1510, MapR-SASL
       and PAM are enabled by default on a secure cluster; no
       configuration is required. Complete the steps below if you want
       HiveServer2 to only accept MapR-SASL authentication.
     * In Hive 0.13-1508 and Hive 1.0-1508, MapR-SASL is not the default
       and must be configured.
     * In Hive 0.13-1504 and Hive 1.0-1504, MapR-SASL is the default
       authentication method when the cluster is secure. No configuration
       is required.

    1. Configure the following property in hive-site.xml on each node
       where HiveServer2 is installed:

                Property            Value
       hive.server2.authentication MAPRSASL
<property> <name>hive.server2.authentication</name> <value>MAPRSASL</value></pro
perty>
    2. Restart HiveServer2 to apply these changes.
maprcli node services -name hs2 -action restart -nodes <comma separated list of
    nodes>
