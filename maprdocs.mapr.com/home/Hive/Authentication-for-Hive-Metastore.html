Authentication for Hive Metastore

   You can configure authentication for in-bound client connections to the
   Hive Metastore when the metastore is remote, not embedded. Clients of
   Hive Metastore include the HiveCLI, HCatalog, HiveServer2, and WebHCat.
   Hive Metastore supports the following authentication methods:
     * MapR-SASL authentication
     * Kerberos Authentication

MapR-SASL Authentication

   MapR-SASL is available starting with the 1504 release of Hive 0.13 and
   Hive 1.0 and it is the default authentication method when the cluster
   is secure.

Kerberos Authentication

   When the cluster is secure, you can configure Hive Metastore to use
   Kerberos authentication. You must also configure Hive Metastore clients
   to use Kerberos when authenticating with Hive Metastore.
