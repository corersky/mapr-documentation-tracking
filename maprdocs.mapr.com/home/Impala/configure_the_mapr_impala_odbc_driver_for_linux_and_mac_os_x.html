Configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driver for Linux and Mac OS X

   The configuration files reside in the the home directory. You can use
   the two environment variables, ODBCINI and ODBCSYSINI, to specify
   different locations for the odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini configuration
   files. Set ODBCINI to point to your odbc.ini file. Set ODBCSYSINI to
   point to the directory containing the odbcinst.ini file. For example,
   if your odbc.ini file is located in /etc and your odbcinst.ini file is
   located in /usr/local/odbc, set the environment variables as follows:
     *
export ODBCINI=/etc/odbc.ini
     *
export ODBCSYSINI=/usr/local/odbc

Sample Files

   The driver installation contains the following sample configuration
   files in the Setup directory:
     *
odbc.ini
     *
odbcinst.ini
     *
mapr.impalaodbc.ini

   The sample files appear in the directory listings by default because
   the filenames do not begin with a (.) Filenames that begin with a (.)
   are hidden. If the default location is used for odbc.ini and
   odbcinst.ini, filenames must begin with a period (.). For
   mapr.impalaodbc.ini, the filename must begin with a (.) and must reside
   in the user’s home directory.

   If the configuration files do not already exist in the home directory,
   you can copy the sample configuration files to that directory and
   rename them. If the configuration files already exist in the home
   directory, use the sample configuration files as a guide for modifying
   the existing configuration files.

   Step 1: Configure the Environment

   By default, the configuration files reside in the user’s home
   directory. However, the ODBCINI, ODBCSYSINI, and SIMBAINI environment
   variables can be used to specify different locations for the odbc.ini,
   odbcinst.ini, and mapr.impalaodbc.ini configuration files. Set ODBCINI
   to point to your odbc.ini file. Set ODBCSYSINI to point to the
   directory containing the odbcinst.ini file. Set SIMBAINI to point to
   your mapr.impalaodbc.ini file. For example, if your odbc.ini and
   mapr.impalaodbc.ini files are located in /etc and your odbcinst.ini
   file is located in /usr/local/odbc, then set the environment variables
   as follows:
     *
export ODBCINI=/etc/odbc.ini
     *
export ODBCSYSINI=/usr/local/odbc
     *
export SIMBAINI=/etc/mapr.impalaodbc.ini

   The following search order is used to locate the mapr.impalaodbc.ini
   file:
    1. If the SIMBAINI environment variable is defined, then the driver
       searches for the file specified by the environment variable.
       Important: SIMBAINI must contain the full path, including the
       filename.
    2. The current working directory of the application is searched for a
       file named mapr.impalaodbc.ini not beginning with a period.
    3. The directory ~/ (that is, $HOME) is searched for a hidden file
       named .mapr.impalaodbc.ini.
    4. The directory /etc is searched for a file named mapr.impalaodbc.ini
       not beginning with a period.

   Step 2: Configure the odbc.ini File

   Define the ODBC data sources in the odbc.ini configuration file. This
   file is divided into the following optional and required sections:
     * (Optional) [ODBC]. Controls global ODBC configuration.
     * (Required) [ODBC Data Sources]. Lists DSNs and associates them with
       a driver.
     * (Required) A section with the same name as the data source
       specified in the [ODBC Data Sources] section. This is required to
       configure the data source.

   Example odbc.ini sample file for Linux
[ODBC Data Sources]
Sample MapR Impala DSN 32=MapR Impala ODBC Driver 32-bit

[Sample MapR Impala DSN 32]
Driver=/opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/32/libmaprimpalaodbc32.so
HOST=MyImpalaServer
PORT=21050

   Example odbc.ini file for Mac OS X
[ODBC Data Sources]
Sample MapR Impala DSN=MapR Impala ODBC Driver

[Sample MapR Impala DSN]
Driver=/opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/universal/libmaprimpalaodbc.dylib
HOST=MyImpalaServer
PORT=21050

   Create a Data Source

   To create a data source, complete the following steps:
    1. Open the .odbc.ini configuration file in a text editor.
    2. Add a new entry to the [ODBC Data Sources] section. Type the data
       source name (DSN) and the driver name.
    3. To set configuration options, add a new section having a name
       matching the data source name (DSN) you specified in step 2.
       Specify configuration options as key-value pairs.
    4. Save the .odbc.ini configuration file.

   Refer to [1]Driver Configuration Options for Linux and Mac OS X for
   available configuration options that control DSN behavior.
   Step 3: Configure the odbcinst.ini File

   The odbcinst.ini is an optional configuration file that defines the
   ODBC Drivers. This configuration file is optional because you can
   specify drivers directly in the odbc.ini configuration file. The
   odbcinst.ini file is divided into the following sections:
     * [ODBC Drivers] lists the names of all the installed ODBC drivers.
     * A section having the same name as the driver name specified in the
       [ODBC Drivers] section lists driver attributes and values.

   Example odbcinst.ini sample file for Linux
[ODBC Drivers]
MapR Impala ODBC Driver 32-bit=Installed
MapR Impala ODBC Driver 64-bit=Installed

[MapR Impala ODBC Driver 32-bit]
Description= MapR Impala ODBC Driver (32-bit)
Driver=/opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/32/libmaprimpalaodbc32.so

[MapR Impala ODBC Driver 64-bit]
Description=MapR Impala ODBC Driver (64-bit)
Driver=/opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/64/libmaprimpalaodbc64.so

   Example odbcinst.ini file for Mac OS X
[ODBC Drivers]
MapR Impala ODBC Driver=Installed

[MapR Impala ODBC Driver]
Description=MapR Impala ODBC Driver
Driver=/opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/universal/libmaprimpalaodbc.dylib

   Define a Driver

   To define a driver, complete the following steps:
    1. Open the .odbcinst.ini configuration file in a text editor.
    2. Add a new entry to the [ODBC Drivers] section. Type the driver
       name, and then type =Installed. Assign the driver name as the value
       of the Driver attribute in the data source definition instead of
       the driver shared library name.
    3. In .odbcinst.ini, add a new section having a name matching the
       driver name you typed in step 2, and add configuration options to
       the section based on the sample odbcinst.ini file provided with
       MapR Impala ODBC Driver for Impala in the Setup directory. Specify
       configuration options as key-value pairs.
    4. Save the .odbcinst.ini configuration file.

   Step 4: Configure the mapr.impalaodbc.ini File

   Configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driverto work with your ODBC driver
   manager.

   To configure mapr.impalaodbc.ini, complete the following steps:
    1. Open the .mapr.impalaodbc.ini configuration file in a text editor.
    2. Edit the DriverManagerEncoding setting. The value is typically
       UTF-16 or UTF-32, but depends on the driver manger used. iODBC uses
       UTF-32 and unixODBC uses UTF-16. Review your ODBC Driver Manager
       documentation for the correct setting.
    3. Edit the ODBCInstLib setting. The value is the name of the ODBCInst
       shared library for the ODBC driver manager you use. The
       configuration file defaults to the shared library for iODBC. In
       Linux, the shared library name for iODBC is libiodbcinst.so. In Mac
       OS X, the shared library name for iODBC is libiodbcinst.dylib.
       Note: Review your ODBC Driver Manager documentation for the correct
       setting. Specify an absolute or relative filename for the library.
       If you use the relative filename, include the path to the library
       in the library path environment variable. In Linux, the library
       path environment variable is LD_LIBRARY_PATH. In Mac OS X, the
       library path environment variable is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    4. Save the .mapr.impalaodbc.ini configuration file.

   Step 5: Configure Authentication

   The Impala server supports multiple authentication mechanisms. You must
   determine the authentication type your server is using and configure
   your DSN accordingly. The following table provides the authentication
   methods available with configuration instructions:

   Note: For details on the keys involved in configuring authentication,
   see [2]Driver Configuration Options for Linux and Mac OS X.
   Method Configuration
   No Authentication For this authentication mechanism, you do not need to
   configure any additional settings. To configure your DSN for
   connections that do not require authentication, set the AuthMech
   configuration key for the DSN to 0.
   Kerberos

   For information on operating Kerberos, refer to the documentation for
   your operating system.

   To configure your DSN to use Kerberos authentication, complete the
   following steps:
    1. Set the AuthMech configuration key for the DSN to 1
    2. If your Kerberos setup does not define a default realm or if the
       realm of your Impala server is not the default, then set the
       appropriate realm using the KrbRealm key.
    3. Set the KrbFQDN key to the fully qualified domain name of the
       Impala host.
    4. Set the KrbServiceName key to the service name of the Impala
       server.
       For example, if the principle for the Impala server is
       impala/fully.qualified.domain.name@your-realm.com, then the value
       in the service name field is impala. If you are unsure of the
       correct service name to use for your particular Hadoop deployment,
       contact your Hadoop administrator.

   User Name

   This authentication mechanism requires a user name but does not require
   a password. The user name labels the session, facilitating database
   tracking.

   To configure your DSN to use User Name authentication, complete the
   following steps:
    1. Set the AuthMech configuration key for the DSN to 2.
    2. Set the UID key to a user name that is recognized by the Impala
       server.

   User Name and Password

   This authentication mechanism requires a user name and a password.

   Note: This authentication mechanism should not be used with an Impala
   configuration that does not have LDAP enabled.

   To configure your DSN to use User Name and Password authentication,
   complete the following steps:
    1. Set the AuthMech configuration key for the DSN to 3.
    2. Set the UID key to a user name that is recognized by the Impala
       server.
    3. Set the PWD key to the password corresponding to the user name you
       provided in step 2.

   User Name and Password (SSL)

   This authentication mechanism uses SSL and requires a user name and a
   password. The driver accepts self-signed SSL certificates.

   Note: This authentication mechanism should not be used with an Impala
   configuration that does not have LDAP enabled.

   To configure your DSN to use User Name and Password (SSL)
   authentication, complete the following steps:
    1. Set the AuthMech configuration key for the DSN to 4.
    2. Set the UID key to a user name that is recognized by the Impala
       server.
    3. Set the PWD key to the password corresponding to the user name you
       provided in step 2.
    4. Optionally, configure the driver to allow a mismatch between the
       common name of a CA-issued certificate and the host name of the
       Impala server by setting the CAIssuedCertNamesMismatch key to 1.

   Note: For self-signed certificates, the driver always allows the common
   name of the certificate to mismatch the host name. For more details,
   see [3]Driver Configuration Options for Linux and Mac OS X.

   Optionally, configure the driver to load SSL certificates from a
   specific file by setting the TrustedCerts configuration key to the path
   of the file.

   Note: By default, the driver uses the trusted CA certificates PEM file
   that is installed with the driver. For more details, see [4]Driver
   Configuration Options for Linux and Mac OS X.
   No Authentication (SSL)

   This authentication mechanism uses SSL but does not require a user name
   or a password. The driver accepts self-signed SSL certificates.

   To configure your DSN to use No Authentication (SSL) authentication,
   complete the following steps:
    1. Set the AuthMech configuration key for the DSN to 5.
    2. Optionally, configure the driver to allow a mismatch between the
       common name of a CA-issued certificate and the host name of the
       Impala server by setting the CAIssuedCertNamesMismatch key to 1.

   Note: For self-signed certificates, the driver always allows the common
   name of the certificate to mismatch the host name. For more details,
   see [5]Driver Configuration Options for Linux and Mac OS X.

   Optionally, configure the driver to load SSL certificates from a
   specific file by setting the TrustedCerts configuration key to the path
   of the file.

   Note: By default, the driver uses the trusted CA certificate PEM file
   that is installed with the driver. For more details, see [6]Driver
   Configuration Options for Linux and Mac OS X.
