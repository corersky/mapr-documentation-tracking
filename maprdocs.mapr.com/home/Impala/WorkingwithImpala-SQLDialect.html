Impala SQL Dialect

   Impala uses the SQL query language and is compatible with the Hive
   query language, HiveQL. You can use other languages, such as Java, to
   interact with Impala through ODBC and JDBC interfaces. The Impala SQL
   dialect supports a subset of SQL and HiveQL functions, statements,
   datatypes, operators, and built-in functions.

   The Impala SQL dialect supports DML statements similar to the DML
   component of HiveQL. The Impala SQL dialect does not support UPDATE and
   DELETE statements, and it does not support the INSERTâ€¦VALUES syntax to
   insert a single row.

   Refer to [1]Supported and Unsupported SQL/HiveQL Language Features for
   a list of supported and unsupported functions, statements, datatypes,
   operators, and features.

Example: Running an Impala SQL Query

   In this example scenario, download a customer CSV file and use the Hive
   shell to create a table and import customer data into the table and
   then run an Impala query on the table.
    1. Download the following CSV file to /root/customers.csv:
       [2]customers.csv
    2. Issue the following command from the hive-shell to import the CSV
       file and create a table:
hive> create table customers(FirstName string,
LastName string,Company string,Address string,
City string,County string,State string,Zip string,
Phone string,Fax string,Email string,Web string)
row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;
    3. Issue the following command in the hive-shell to load the customer
       data into the customers table:
Hive> load data local inpath '/root/customers.csv' overwrite into table customer
s;
    4. Issue the following command to start the Impala shell:
$ impala-shell
    5. To connect to an instance of Impala, issue the following CONNECT
       command, replacing impalad-host with the host name you have
       configured on a node running Impala:
[Not connected] > connect impalad-host
[impalad-host:21000] >
    6. Issue the following command to query the data to find the total
       number of customers:
select count(*) from customers

   The query returns the following result:
+--------+
| count(*) |
+--------+
| 501 |
+--------+
