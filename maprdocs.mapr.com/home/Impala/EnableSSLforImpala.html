Enable SSL for Impala

   Impala 2.5.0 supports SSL encryption for internal Impala connections.

   Complete the following steps to configure SSL for Impala:
    1. Configure encryption in Hive. See [1]Hive Encryption.
    2. Configure client-server encryption only or configure client-server
       and Impala internal encryption.
          + To configure client-server encryption only, add the following
            start-up options for the Impala Server to
            /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh:

              -ssl_server_certificate
                      Full path to the server certificate on the local
                      file system.

              -ssl_private_key
                      Full path to the server private key on the local
                      file system.

          + To configure client-server and Impala internal encryption, add
            the following start-up options for the Impala server, catalog,
            and statestore to
            /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh:

              -ssl_server_certificate
                      Full path to the server certificate on the local
                      file system.

              -ssl_private_key
                      Full path to the server private key on the local
                      file system.

              -ssl_client_ca_certificate
                      Full path to the certificate on the local file
                      system required for client/server encryption.

   Note: When you add the SSL flags to Impala start-up options, Impala
   listens for HiveServer2 on the SSL-secured ports. A client program
   usually has equivalent options to verify a connection to the correct
   server.

   After you enable SSL, you can issue the following options when you
   start the impala-shell:
   Option Description
--ssl

   Enables SSL for the impala-shell.
--ca_cert

   Local path name that points to the third-party CA certificate, or to a
   copy of the server certificate for self-signed server certificates. If
   --ca_cert is not set, impala-shell enables SSL, but does not validate
   the server certificate. This is useful for connecting to an Impala node
   that you know is only running over SSL when a copy of the certificate
   is not available.

   For more information about the impala-shell, refer to [2]Impala-Shell
   Commands.

   [3]Additional Impala Configuration Options.
