Programming Interfaces

   You can connect to Impala daemons through the impala-shell or through a
   JDBC or ODBC client. You can use the impala-shell to query data from a
   Linux environment. In a non-Linux environment, you can query data using
   JDBC and ODBC applications.

Impala Shell

   The Impala-shell is a command line tool that you can use for setting up
   databases and tables, inserting data, and issuing queries using SQL
   statements and some shell commands. The impala-shell can reside on any
   client machine.

   You can connect to the same node and issue all SQL statements through
   that particular node to avoid issuing the REFRESH statement frequently.
   For load balancing, you can connect to different nodes for each
   impala-shell session. When you connect to different Impala nodes, you
   may need to issue the REFRESH and INVALIDATE METADATA statements to
   update table data and metadata.

   When you run commands from within the impala-shell, use a semi-colon to
   terminate commands. Each command can span multiple lines. Refer to
   [1]Impala-Shell Commands and Command Line Options for a list of
   commands and options that you can issue from within the impala-shell.
   Connecting to impalad from impala-shell

   You can connect to any node running the Impala daemon process from the
   impala-shell using the CONNECT command. Once connected, you can send
   queries to the Impala node from the command line.

   To connect to impalad, complete the following steps:
    1. Issue the following command to start the impala-shell without a
       connection:
$ impala-shell
    2. Issue the CONNECT command to connect to an instance of Impala,
       replacing impalad-host with the hostname of the node that you want
       to connect to.
       Example:
[Not connected] > connect impalad-host
[impalad-host:21000] >

JDBC and ODBC Clients

   You can use a JDBC or ODBC client to connect to Impala and run queries
   against data stored in MapR-FS and MapR-DB. The client or application
   issues a query to an Impala daemon through an ODBC or JDBC connection.
   The ODBC and JDBC driver submits the query to Impala in the form of a
   SQL statement.

   Install a JDBC or ODBC driver on the client machine and then configure
   the driver to enable communication between the client and Impala. For
   driver download, installation, and connection information, refer to the
   following documentation:
