New Features in Impala 2.10 for MapR

   Impala 2.10.0 for MapR introduces some new features that enhance the
   behavior and performance of Impala.

Functions

   The following sections provide information about new and improved
   Impala functions:

String function, replace()

   Faster than regexp_replace() for simple string substitutions.

   Description: replace(string initial, string target, string replacement)

   Purpose: Returns the initial argument with all occurrences of the
   target string replaced by the replacement string.

   Return type: string

   Usage notes: Because this function does not use any regular expression
   patterns, it is typically faster than regexp_replace() for simple
   string substitutions. If any argument is NULL, the return value is
   NULL. The matching is case-sensitive. If the replacement string
   contains another instance of the target string, the expansion is only
   performed once, instead of applying it again to the newly constructed
   string.
   Example:
[localhost:21000] > select replace('hello world','world','earth');
Query: select replace('hello world','world','earth')
Query submitted at: 2018-02-08 05:10:11 (Coordinator: http://localhost.lab:25000
)
Query progress can be monitored at: http://localhost:25000/query_plan?query_id=5

+------------------------------------------+
| replace('hello world', 'world', 'earth') |
+------------------------------------------+
| hello earth |
+------------------------------------------+
Fetched 1 row(s) in 0.02s

Date/time function, last_day()

   For finding the date corresponding to the last day of a particular
   month.

   Description:last_day(timestamp t)

   Purpose: timestamp

   Usage notes: If the input argument does not represent a valid Impala
   TIMESTAMP including both date and time portions, the function returns
   NULL. For example, if the input argument is a string that cannot be
   implicitly cast to TIMESTAMP, does not include a date portion, or is
   out of the allowed range for Impala TIMESTAMP values, the function
   returns NULL.
   Example:
[localhost:21000] > select
> now() as right_now
> , dayofmonth(now()) as day
> , extract(day from now()) as also_day
> , dayofmonth(last_day(now())) as last_day
> , extract(day from last_day(now())) as also_last_day;
Query: select now() as right_now
, dayofmonth(now()) as day
, extract(day from now()) as also_day
, dayofmonth(last_day(now())) as last_day
, extract(day from last_day(now())) as also_last_day
Query submitted at: 2018-02-08 05:07:59 (Coordinator: http://localhost:25000)
Query progress can be monitored at: http://localhost:25000/query_plan?query_id=5
147af5bc88d7632:1e42f5c100000000
+-------------------------------+-----+----------+----------+---------------+
| right_now | day | also_day | last_day | also_last_day |
+-------------------------------+-----+----------+----------+---------------+
| 2018-02-08 05:07:59.999909000 | 8 | 8 | 28 | 28 |
+-------------------------------+-----+----------+----------+---------------+

Date/time function, last_day()

   Provides a simple way to get a stable, interoperable representation of
   a TIMESTAMP value without using a chain of functions to convert between
   representations and apply a specific timezone.

Other Features

   Impala Query History
   You can re-execute previously queries via @query_number(from start) or
   @-query_number(from end):
[localhost:21000] >@1;
Rerunning invalidate metadata;
Query: invalidate metadata
[localhost:21000] > @-1;
Rerunning show tables in default;
Query: show tables in default

   Drop partitions via special symbols (<, >, <>, !=, <=, >=)
   ALTER TABLE query for DROP partition can use special symbols for drop
   range of the partitions:
ALTER TABLE db.table DROP PARTITION (partition<=partition_value);

   CREATE TABLE with SORT BY
   Introduced SORT BY clause in the CREATE TABLE statement:
CREATE TABLE sorted_tbl (id int, name char(22), age int) SORT BY (age);

   TRUNK() can now apply to numeric types (FLOAT, DOUBLE, and DECIMAL) in
   addition to TIMESTAMP

   Although this functionality was already available through the
   truncate() function, the new signatures for trunc() make it easier to
   port code from other popular database systems to Impala.

   Support ENUM type for parquet tables

   The CREATE TABLE LIKE PARQUET statement can now handle Parquet files
   produced outside of Impala and containing ENUM types. The ENUM columns
   become STRING columns in the target table, and the ENUM values are
   turned into corresponding STRING values.
