UDF Security

   If you enable the Impala authorization feature, consider the following:
     * You must have the required read privilege for database and tables
       used in the query to call a UDF in the query.
     * Only an administrative user can create UDFs because improperly
       coded UDFs can cause performance and capacity issues. Issuing the
       CREATE FUNCTION statement requires the ALL privilege on the server.
