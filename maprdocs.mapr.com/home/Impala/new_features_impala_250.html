New Features in Impala 2.5.0 for MapR

   Impala 2.5.0 for MapR introduces some new features that enhance the
   behavior and performance of Impala.

Performance Improvements

   The following updates improve the performance of Impala:
     * Impala caches file handles to avoid the overhead of repeatedly
       opening the same file which improves I/O performance.
     * Basic query types, such as counting the elements of a complex
       column, use an optimized code path that improves the performance of
       queries involving nested complex types.
     * Impala uses code generation in certain parts of queries, such as
       evaluating functions in the WHERE clause, even when code generation
       is not used in some phases of query execution.
     * Using DECIMAL values in a GROUP BY clause triggers code generation
       optimization, which speeds up queries that group by values, such as
       prices, and improves performance and reliability of the DECIMAL
       data type.
     * Improved coordination and parallelization between Impala nodes
       results in faster query startup time for queries that involve
       tables with many partitions or complex queries with many fragments.
     * The coordinator node requires less memory, making it faster and
       less resource-intensive when performing joins that involve several
       tables with thousands of partitions.
     * Impala only re-evaluates metadata for partitions that are affected
       by a DDL operation, not all partitions in the table. While a DDL or
       insert statement is in progress, other Impala statements that
       attempt to modify metadata for the same table wait until the first
       one finishes, improving performance and reliability of DDL and
       insert operations on partitioned tables with a large number of
       partitions.
     * A new query option, OPTIMIZE_PARTITION_KEY_SCANS, speeds up
       aggregation operations that involve only the partition key columns
       of partitioned tables. This optimization can produce different
       results when files in a partition are manually deleted or are
       empty.

Security

   This release of Impala provides the following new security features:

   Column-Level Authorization
          You can use column-level authorization to define access to
          particular columns within a table instead of the entire table.
          Creating views to set up authorization schemes for subsets of
          information is not required. This functionality requires Sentry
          1.6

          Column-level authorization has the following syntax:

GRANT SELECT(column_name) ON TABLE table_name TO ROLE role_name;
REVOKE SELECT(column_name) ON TABLE table_name FROM ROLE role_name;

   LDAP Password Retrieval
          You can use a new impala-shell command line option,
          --ldap_password_cmd, to retrieve the LDAP password. The
          resulting password is used to authenticate the impala-shell
          command with the LDAP server.

Scripting Capability Improvements

   Scripting capability improvements for the impala-shell enable you to
   define substitution variables and use them in SQL statements that you
   execute through command-line options. The --var command-line option
   passes key-value pairs to the impala-shell. The shell substitutes the
   values into an SQL statement where it contains the notation
   ${var:varname} before Impala executes the query.

   You can use the SET and UNSET commands in a session to define or clear
   substitution variables with the SET|UNSET VAR:variable_name=value
   notation or a script file processed by the â€“f option. You cannot define
   your own substitution variables through the SET statement in a JDBC or
   ODBC application.

Dynamic Partition Pruning

   Dynamic partition pruning is a technique that prevents Impala from
   reading data files from partitions that are not included in the result
   set. This occurs when a query references a partition key column in the
   WHERE clause and the column values are unknown until the query runs.
   Impala evaluates the predicate and skips the I/O for unnecessary
   partitions. This technique is useful for join queries that involve
   large partitioned tables.

   You can control the level of dynamic partition pruning through the
   RUNTIME_FILTER_MODE query option. By default, this option is enabled
   and set at medium level: RUNTIME_FILTER_MODE=LOCAL). The maximum
   setting uses more memory for queries than in previous releases. You can
   set RUNTIME_FILTER_MODE=GLOBAL to fully enable dynamic partition
   pruning. Before you run a query, check the EXPLAIN output to verify
   that partition pruning is applied.

Nested Loop Join Queries

   Nested loop joins make additional non-equijoin queries possible and
   optimize queries that retrieve values from complex type columns. Some
   join queries that previously needed equality comparisons can use
   operators.

Live Progress Reporting

   The live progress reporting feature enables you to monitor the status
   of queries through two command-line options, --live_progress and
   --live_summary. The live progress option provides an interactive
   progress bar that represents the percent completion for queries
   submitted through the impala-shell command. The live summary option
   summarizes the work performed in various stages of a query with the
   measurements updated in real time as the query progresses. These query
   options are disabled by default. To enable these options, start the
   impala-shell with the --live_progress and --live_summary command-line
   options, or use the SET command with LIVE_SUMMARY and LIVE_PROGRESS
   during a session:
set live_progress=true|false;
set live_summary=true|false;

Runtime Filtering

   Runtime filtering is technique where Impala determines the filter
   conditions as a query runs and broadcasts the information to the Impala
   nodes reading a table. This technique is useful for optimizing queries
   against partitioned tables or to evaluate join conditions when only
   partial table data is needed. The technique eliminates the I/O required
   to read all of the partitioned data, as well as unnecessary network
   traffic.
   The following table lists the new query options related to runtime
   filtering:
   Option Description Type Default
   RUNTIME_FILTER_MODE Adjusts the settings, turns the feature on and off,
   and controls how extensively the filters are transmitted between hosts.
   numeric (0, 1, 2) or corresponding mnemonic strings (OFF, LOCAL,
   GLOBAL) 1 (same as LOCAL)
   MAX_NUM_RUNTIME_FILTERS Sets an upper limit on the number of runtime
   filters produced for each query. integer 10
   RUNTIME_BLOOM_FILTER_SIZE Size (in bytes) of Bloom filter data
   structure used by the runtime filtering feature. integer

   1048576 (1 MB)

   Max: 16 MB
   RUNTIME_FILTER_WAIT_TIME_MS Maximum filter wait time in milliseconds.
   By default, each scan node waits for up to 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
   for filters to arrive. If all filters have not arrived within the
   specified interval, the scan node proceeds, using whatever filters did
   arrive to help avoid reading unnecessary data. If a filter arrives
   after the scan node begins reading data, the scan node applies that
   filter to the data that is read after the filter arrives, but not to
   the data that was already read. integer 1000 milliseconds
   DISABLE_ROW_RUNTIME_FILTERING

   Reduces the scope of the runtime filtering feature. Queries still
   dynamically prune partitions, but do not apply the filtering logic to
   individual rows within partitions.

   Only applies to queries against Parquet tables. For other file formats,
   Impala only prunes at the level of partitions, not individual rows.
   Boolean; recognized values are 1 and 0, or true and false; any other
   value interpreted as false

   false

Data Types

   Impala now supports new complex data types that can encode multiple
   named fields, positional items, or key-value pairs within a single
   column. You can combine these types to produce nested types with
   arbitrarily deep nesting. Currently, complex data types are only
   supported for the Parquet file format.
   The following table lists the complex data types and the syntax for
   each:
   Data Type Syntax
   STRUCT

   column_name STRUCT < name : type [COMMENT 'comment_string'], ... >

   type ::= primitive_type | complex_type
   ARRAY

   column_name ARRAY < type >

   type ::= primitive_type | complex_type
   MAP

   column_name MAP < primitive_type, type >

   type ::= primitive_type | complex_type

Operators

   The following table provides the new and improved operators with
   descriptions and syntax:
   Operator Description Syntax
   ILIKE Improvements enable the ILIKE operator to perform
   case-insensitive wildcard matches or regular expression matches, rather
   than explicitly converting column values with UPPER or LOWER.

   string_expression ILIKE wildcard_expression

   string_expression NOT ILIKE wildcard_expression
   IREGEXPR Improvements enable the IREGEXPR operator to perform
   case-insensitive wildcard matches or regular expression matches, rather
   than explicitly converting column values with UPPER or LOWER.
   string_expression IREGEXP regular_expression
   IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM

   Compares values for a true or false result, even if one or both values
   are NULL. The IS NOT DISTINCT FROM operator, or its equivalent <=>
   notation, improves the efficiency of join queries that treat key values
   that are NULL in both tables as equal.

   expression1 IS DISTINCT FROM expression2

   expression1 IS NOT DISTINCT FROM expression2

   expression1 <=> expression2

Statements

   The following table lists new or improved statements with their
   descriptions and syntax:
   Statement Description Syntax
   TRUNCATE TABLE Removes all data from a table without removing the table
   itself. The statement accepts the IF EXISTS clause, making TRUNCATE
   TABLE easier to use in setup or ETL scripts where the table might or
   might not exist.

   TRUNCATE TABLE [IF EXISTS] [db_name.]table_name

   CREATE TABLE AS SELECT The CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statement accepts a
   PARTITIONED BY clause. You can create a partitioned table and insert
   data into the table with a single statement.

   CREATE [EXTERNAL] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] db_name.]table_name

   [PARTITIONED BY (col_name[, ...])]

   [COMMENT 'table_comment']

   [WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ('key1'='value1', 'key2'='value2', ...)]

   [

   [ROW FORMAT row_format] [STORED AS file_format]

   ]

   [LOCATION 'hdfs_path']

   [TBLPROPERTIES ('key1'='value1', 'key2'='value2', ...)]

   [CACHED IN 'pool_name' [WITH REPLICATION = integer] | UNCACHED]

   AS

   select_statement
   SHOW DATABASES The SHOW DATABASES statement returns two columns rather
   than one. The second column includes the associated comment string, if
   it exists, for each database. SHOW DATABASES;
   DESCRIBE The DESCRIBE statement displays metadata about a database.
   DESCRIBE DATABASE db_name;
   DROP DATABASE The DROP DATABASE statement works for a nonempty
   database. When you specify the optional CASCADE clause, any tables in
   the database are dropped before the database itself is removed.

   DROP (DATABASE|SCHEMA) [IF EXISTS] database_name [RESTRICT | CASCADE];

   DROP TABLE/ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION The DROP TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and
   DROP PARTITION statements have an optional keyword, PURGE. PURGE causes
   Impala to immediately remove the relevant data files rather than
   sending them to the trashcan. This feature can help to avoid
   out-of-space errors on storage devices, and to avoid files being left
   behind in case of a problem with the trashcan. PURGE works when the
   trashcan is enabled.

   DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] [db_name.]table_name [PURGE]

   ALTER TABLE name { ADD [IF NOT EXISTS] | DROP [IF EXISTS] } PARTITION
   (partition_spec) [PURGE]

Functions

   The following sections provide information about new and improved
   Impala functions.

   User-Defined Functions
          User-defined functions written in C++ persist when the catalog
          service is restarted. You no longer have to run the CREATE
          FUNCTION statements again after a restart. You must still
          reissue the CREATE FUNCTION statement for any Java-based
          user-defined functions. User-defined aggregate functions have
          more flexibility for intermediate data types.

   Analytic (Window) Functions
          The following table lists the new analytic functions:

   Function Description Syntax
   PERCENT_RANK Calculates the rank, expressed as a percentage, of each
   row within a group of rows. If rank is the value for that same row from
   the RANK() function (from 1 to the total number of rows in the
   partition group), then the PERCENT_RANK() value is calculated as (rank
   - 1) / (rows_in_group - 1). If there is only a single item in the
   partition group, its PERCENT_RANK() value is 0. The ORDER BY clause is
   required. The PARTITION BY clause is optional. The window clause is not
   allowed.

   PERCENT_RANK (expr)
   OVER ([partition_by_clause] order_by_clause)
   NTILE Returns the "bucket number" associated with each row, between 1
   and the value of an expression. For example, creating 100 buckets puts
   the lowest 1% of values in the first bucket, while creating 10 buckets
   puts the lowest 10% of values in the first bucket. Each partition can
   have a different number of buckets. The ORDER BY clause is required.
   The PARTITION BY clause is optional. The window clause is not allowed.

   NTILE (expr [, offset ...]
   OVER ([partition_by_clause] order_by_clause)
   CUME_DIST
   Returns the cumulative distribution of a value. The value for each row
   in the result set is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
   The ORDER BY clause is required. The PARTITION BY clause is optional.
   The window clause is not allowed.
   CUME_DIST (expr)
   OVER ([partition_by_clause] order_by_clause)

   Math Functions
          The following table lists the new math functions:

   Function Description Return Type
   cot(double a) Returns the cotangent of the argument. double
   factorial(integer_type a)

   Computes the factorial of an integer value and works with any integer
   type.
   You can use either the factorial() function or the ! operator. The
   factorial of 0 is 1. The factorial() function returns 1 for any
   negative value. The maximum positive value for the input argument is
   20; a value of 21 or greater overflows the range for a BIGINT and
   causes an error.
   bigint
   radians(double a) Converts the argument value from degrees to radians.
   double

   String Functions
          The following table lists the new string functions:

   Function Description Return Type
   btrim(string a), btrim(string a, string chars_to_trim) Removes all
   instances of one or more characters from the start and end of a STRING
   value. By default, removes only spaces. If a non-NULL optional second
   argument is specified, the function removes all occurrences of
   characters in that second argument from the beginning and end of the
   string. string
   chr(int character_code) Returns a character specified by a decimal code
   point value. The interpretation and display of the resulting character
   depends on your system locale. Because consistent processing of Impala
   string values is only guaranteed for values within the ASCII range,
   only use this function for values corresponding to ASCII characters. In
   particular, parameter values greater than 255 return an empty string.
   string
   regexp_like(string source, string pattern[, string options])
   Returns true or false to indicate whether the source string contains
   anywhere inside it the regular expression given by the pattern. The
   optional third argument consists of letter flags that change how the
   match is performed, such as i for case-insensitive matching. boolean
   split_part(string source, string delimiter, bigint n) Returns the nth
   field within a delimited string. The fields are numbered starting from
   1. The delimiter can consist of multiple characters, not just a single
   character. All matching of the delimiter is done exactly, not using any
   regular expression patterns. string

   Date/Time Functions
          The following table lists the new date and time functions:

   Function Description Return Type
   int_months_between(timestamp newer, timestamp older) Returns the number
   of months between the date portions of two TIMESTAMP values, as an INT
   representing only the full months that passed. int
   months_between(timestamp newer, timestamp older) Returns the number of
   months between the date portions of two TIMESTAMP values. Can include a
   fractional part representing extra days in addition to the full months
   between the dates. The fractional component is computed by dividing the
   difference in days by 31 (regardless of the month). double
   timeofday() Returns a string representation of the current date and
   time, according to the time of the local system, including any time
   zone designation. string
   timestamp_cmp(timestamp t1, timestamp t2) Tests if one TIMESTAMP value
   is newer than, older than, or identical to another TIMESTAMP. int
   (either -1, 0, 1, or NULL)

   Bit Manipulation Functions
          The following table lists the new bit manipulation functions:

   Function Description Return Type
   bitand(integer_type a, same_type b) Returns an integer value
   representing the bits that are set to 1 in both of the arguments. If
   the arguments are of different sizes, the smaller is promoted to the
   type of the larger. Equivalent to the & binary operator. Same as the
   input value
   bitnot(integer_type a)

   Inverts all the bits of the input argument.
   Equivalent to the ~ unary operator.
   Same as the input value
   bitor(integer_type a, same_type b) Returns an integer value
   representing the bits that are set to 1 in either of the arguments. If
   the arguments are of different sizes, the smaller is promoted to the
   type of the larger. Equivalent to the | binary operator. Same as the
   input value
   bitxor(integer_type a, same_type b) Returns an integer value
   representing the bits that are set to 1 in one but not both of the
   arguments. If the arguments are of different sizes, the smaller is
   promoted to the type of the larger. Equivalent to the ^ binary
   operator. Same as the input value
   countset(integer_type a [, int zero_or_one]) By default, returns the
   number of 1 bits in the specified integer value. If the optional second
   argument is set to zero, it returns the number of 0 bits instead. Same
   as the input value
   getbit(integer_type a, int position) Returns a 0 or 1 representing the
   bit at a specified position. The positions are numbered right to left,
   starting at zero. The position argument cannot be negative. When you
   use a literal input value, it is treated as an 8-bit, 16-bit, and so on
   value, the smallest type that is appropriate. The type of the input
   value limits the range of the positions. Cast the input value to the
   appropriate type if you need to ensure it is treated as a 64-bit,
   32-bit, and so on value. Same as the input value
   rotateleft(integer_type a, int positions)

   Rotates an integer value left by a specified number of bits. As the
   most significant bit is taken out of the original value, if it is a 1
   bit, it is "rotated" back to the least significant bit. Therefore, the
   final value has the same number of 1 bits as the original value, just
   in different positions.
   Specifying a second argument of zero leaves the original value
   unchanged. Rotating a -1 value by any number of positions still returns
   -1, because the original value has all 1 bits and all the 1 bits are
   preserved during rotation. Similarly, rotating a 0 value by any number
   of positions still returns 0. Rotating a value by the same number of
   bits as in the value returns the same value. Because this is a circular
   operation, the number of positions is not limited to the number of bits
   in the input value. For example, rotating an 8-bit value by 1, 9, 17,
   and so on positions returns an identical result in each case.
   Same as the input value
   rotateright(integer_type a, int positions) Rotates an integer value
   right by a specified number of bits. As the least significant bit is
   taken out of the original value, if it is a 1 bit, it is "rotated" back
   to the most significant bit. Therefore, the final value has the same
   number of 1 bits as the original value, just in different positions.
   Specifying a second argument of zero leaves the original value
   unchanged. Rotating a -1 value by any number of positions still returns
   -1, because the original value has all 1 bits and all the 1 bits are
   preserved during rotation. Similarly, rotating a 0 value by any number
   of positions still returns 0. Rotating a value by the same number of
   bits as in the value returns the same value. Because this is a circular
   operation, the number of positions is not limited to the number of bits
   in the input value. For example, rotating an 8-bit value by 1, 9, 17,
   and so on positions returns an identical result in each case. Same as
   the input value
   setbit(integer_type a, int position [, int zero_or_one])

   By default, changes a bit at a specified position to a 1, if it is not
   already. If the optional third argument is set to zero, the specified
   bit is set to 0 instead. If the bit at the specified position was
   already 1 (by default) or 0 (with a third argument of zero), the return
   value is the same as the first argument. The positions are numbered
   right to left, starting at zero. (Therefore, the return value could be
   different from the first argument even if the position argument is
   zero.) The position argument cannot be negative.
   When you use a literal input value, it is treated as an 8-bit, 16-bit,
   and so on value, the smallest type that is appropriate. The type of the
   input value limits the range of the positions. Cast the input value to
   the appropriate type if you need to ensure it is treated as a 64-bit,
   32-bit, and so on value.
   Same as the input value
   shiftleft(integer_type a, int positions) Shifts an integer value left
   by a specified number of bits. As the most significant bit is taken out
   of the original value, it is discarded and the least significant bit
   becomes 0. The final value has either the same number of 1 bits as the
   original value, or fewer. Shifting an 8-bit value by 8 positions, a
   16-bit value by 16 positions, and so on produces a result of zero.
   Specifying a second argument of zero leaves the original value
   unchanged. Shifting any value by 0 returns the original value. Shifting
   any value by 1 is the same as multiplying it by 2, as long as the value
   is small enough; larger values eventually become negative when shifted,
   as the sign bit is set. Starting with the value 1 and shifting it left
   by N positions gives the same result as 2 to the Nth power, or
   pow(2,N). Same as the input value
   shiftright(integer_type a, int positions)

   Shifts an integer value right by a specified number of bits. As the
   least significant bit is taken out of the original value, it is
   discarded and the most significant bit becomes 0. Therefore, the final
   value has either the same number of 1 bits as the original value, or
   fewer. Shifting an 8-bit value by 8 positions, a 16-bit value by 16
   positions, and so on produces a result of zero. Specifying a second
   argument of zero leaves the original value unchanged. Shifting any
   value by 0 returns the original value. Shifting any positive value
   right by 1 is the same as dividing it by 2. Negative values become
   positive when shifted right.
   Same as the input value

   Miscellaneous Functions
          The following table lists a new miscellaneous function:

   Function Description Syntax
   uuid() The uuid() function generates an alphanumeric value that you can
   use as a guaranteed unique identifier. The uniqueness applies across
   tables in cases where an ascending numeric sequence is not suitable.

   select uuid();
   typeof(type value) A type conversion function that returns the name of
   the data type corresponding to an expression. For types with extra
   attributes, such as length for CHAR and VARCHAR, or precision and scale
   for DECIMAL, includes the full specification of the type.

   select typeof(type value);
   Returns the type
   For example, select typeof('xyz'); returns STRING
   For example, select typeof(5.30001 / 2342.1); returns DECIMAL(13,11)
