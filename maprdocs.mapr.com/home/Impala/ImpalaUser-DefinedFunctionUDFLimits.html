UDF Limitations

   Impala UDFs have the following limitations:
     * Impala cannot work with UDFs that accept or return composite,
       nested, or types not available in Impala tables.
     * UDFs must produce the same output each time the same argument value
       is passed.
     * UDFs cannot spawn other threads or processes.
     * UDFs become undefined when you restart the catalogd process. In
       this scenario, you must reload the UDFs.
     * You currently cannot include user-defined table functions in Impala
       queries.
