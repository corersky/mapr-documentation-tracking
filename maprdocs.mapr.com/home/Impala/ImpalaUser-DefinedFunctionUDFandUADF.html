UDFs and UDAFs

   UDFs and UDAFs differ in the number of rows that they accept as input.
   A UDF operates on a single row and produces a single row as the output.
   When you use a UDF in a query, the UDF is called once for each row in
   the result set. Mathematical and string functions are examples of UDFs.
   When you create a UDF, you issue the CREATE FUNCTION statement. After
   you create a UDF, you can use it in the expression of a SQL statement.

   A UDAF operates on multiple input rows and produces a single row as
   output. The COUNT(), MAX(), SUM(), and AVG() aggregate functions are
   examples of UDAFs. You might use a UDAF in a query with a GROUP BY
   clause to produce a result set with a separate aggregate value for each
   combination of values from the GROUP BY clause. When you create UDAFs,
   use the CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION statement. After you create a UDAF,
   you can use it the expression of a SQL statement.

   When you create UDFs and UDAFs, they cannot have the same name as any
   of the built-in functions.
