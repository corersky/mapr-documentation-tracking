The global-policy.ini File

   The default global-policy.ini file defines the admin_role, which gives
   full access to the Hiveserver2 server for the mapr user. The file is
   located in /opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<version>/conf in your local file
   system. You can relocate the file to MapR-FS if you prefer. By default,
   this file contains these sections:
[groups]
      mapr = admin_role

      [roles]
      admin_role = server=HS2

Sample sentry-provider.ini File

[databases]
        # Defines the location of the per-DB policy file for the customer's DB o
r schema
        customers = /etc/sentry/customers.ini

        [groups]
        customers_admin = customers_admin_role

        [roles]
        customers_admin_role = server=HS2->db=customers

Sample customers.ini File

[groups]
        manager = customers_insert_role, customers_select_role
        analyst = customers_select_role

        [roles]
        customers_insert_role = server=HS2->db=customers->table=*->action=insert
        customers_select_role = server=HS2->db=customers->table=*->action=select
