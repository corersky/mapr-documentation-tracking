Impala Security

Features

   Warning: While Impala is supported and compatible with MapR, using
   Impala is not encouraged for several reasons:
     * By design, Impala security secures data outside the underlying file
       system, which creates the potential of backdoor access. When you
       enable Impala authorization using Sentry, the MapR platform
       security is bypassed and the MapR converged data platform can no
       longer fully secure your data.
     * If you enable this Impala security, impersonation will be disabled
       and data ownership will be shifted to the Impala user, which makes
       the "Impala" data inaccessible by regular users through means other
       than Hive or Impala (because the users no longer own the data).

   You can configure Impala to use the security features listed in the
   next table on either a secure or a non-secure MapR cluster. If you use
   the MapR Installer and select Enable Security, Impala will not be
   automatically secured.
   Feature Description
   LDAP You can configure LDAP authentication for client connections with
   Impala. You can use LDAP authentication with Sentry to authenticate
   users and provide precise levels of access to users. See [1]LDAP
   Authentication for Impala.
   Kerberos You can configure Impala to use Kerberos for authentication.
   You can also use [2]Sentry authorization in conjunction with Kerberos
   if you want to configure user-level access to databases, tables,
   columns, and partitions. See [3]Enable Kerberos Authentication for
   Impala.
   MapR Security

   You can configure MapR security between Impala and Hive. See
   [4]Configure Hive Metastore to use MapR-SASL.
   Note: MapR security is not present between the Impala client and the
   Impala server. To avoid security holes, you must configure the Impala
   client on Kerberos or LDAP.
   SSL You can enable SSL network encryption for communication between
   Impala and client programs and between Impala nodes in a cluster. See
   [5]Enable SSL for Impala.
   Important: The Impala client does not support MapR ticket security, but
   you can authentication connections as follows:
     * Between the Impala server and client (JDBC, Impala-shell) -
       Kerberos or LDAP. However, you might encounter issues with Impala
       on Kerberos using the JDBC connector.
     * Between Impala (the Impala catalog) and Hive metastore - MapR
       ticket security or Kerberos.

   To avoid security holes, configure Impala on Kerberos or LDAP. If
   Impala is not secure or only has LDAP authentication enabled, only the
   client connection to Impala is authenticated and there is no wire level
   encryption or server-to-server authentication.
   You can enable [6]MapR SASL for the Hive metastore. When the Hive
   metastore is SASL enabled, Impala can run in any security mode (none,
   LDAP, or Kerberos).

Component Compatibility

   You can configure Impala to use the components and/or features listed
   below on a secure MapR cluster. The following table assumes that each
   component is configured with Kerberos on Impala. Hive and Hue can be
   configured with MapR security for authentication.
   Note: MapR security is not present between the Impala client and the
   Impala server. To avoid security holes, you must configure the Impala
   client on Kerberos or LDAP. Hive and Hue use MapR security.

   The following table lists the supported and unsupported component and
   security combinations necessary to access the Hive metastore:

   security.
   [8]Hive + Kerberos
   None Supported Not supported
