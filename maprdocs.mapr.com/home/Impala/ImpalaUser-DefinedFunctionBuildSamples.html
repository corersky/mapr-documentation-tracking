Build the Samples

   To build the samples, complete the following steps:
    1. Issue the cmake configuration command. This command reads the file
       CMakeLists.txt, and generates a Makefile customized for your
       directory paths.
    2. Issue the make command. The make command runs the build steps based
       on rules in the Makefile. Impala loads the shared library from a
       MapR-FS location.

   The samples get built to build/. This contains test executables that
   you can run locally, without the Impala service installed. It also
   contains shared object artifacts that you can run on Impala.

   At this point, you can write your UDFs or UDAFs. When you write your
   functions, build a shared library to contain them. Use the mapr or
   hadoop commands to copy the binary files to a MapR-FS location that
   Impala can read from.
