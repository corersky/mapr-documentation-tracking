Authentication on Secure Clusters for HttpFS

   In MEP 3.0, HttpFS features several authentication methods on secure
   clusters. HttpFS authentication, such as MapR native security
   (MapR-SASL), Kerberos (for which [1]additional configuration is
   required), or plain (using PAM) is determined automatically.

   The following httpfs-site.xml file properties are set by default:
<property>
      <name>httpfs.hadoop.authentication.type</name>
      <value>multiauth</value>
</property>
<property>
      <name>httpfs.authentication.type</name>
      <value>multiauth</value>
</property>
