Step 6: Configure Workspaces

   You must configure a workspace on one Drill node in each Drill cluster
   that points to the volume directory where data is stored. When you
   create a workspace, you must include the volume mount point.
   For example, if you created a volume with a mount point /operational
   for the OJAI Distributed Query Service cluster, and stored your data in
   /data/here/ within that volume, you must configure the workspace, as
   follows:
 {
     "type": "file",
     "enabled": true,
     "connection": "file:///",
     "workspaces": {
       "root": {
         "location": "/",
         "writable": false,
         "defaultInputFormat": null
       },
       "tmp": {
         "location": "/tmp",
         "writable": true,
         "defaultInputFormat": null
       },
       "operational": {
           "location": "/operational/data/here",
           "writable": true,
           "defaultInputFormat": null
          }
     }

   Likewise, if you also created a volume with a mount point /analytical
   for the other Drill cluster that runs analytical queries, and stored
   your data in /data/here/ within that volume, you must configure the
   workspace, as follows:
{
     "type": "file",
     "enabled": true,
     "connection": "file:///",
     "workspaces": {
       "root": {
         "location": "/",
         "writable": false,
         "defaultInputFormat": null
       },
       "tmp": {
         "location": "/tmp",
         "writable": true,
         "defaultInputFormat": null
       },
       "analytical": {
         "location": "/analytical/data/here",
         "writable": true,
         "defaultInputFormat": null
        }
     }

   You can define a workspace in the Drill dfs storage plugin
   configuration on the Storage page in the Drill Web Console at
   https://<drill-node-ip-address>:8047. You only need to configure the
   workspace on one Drill node in each Drill cluster.
