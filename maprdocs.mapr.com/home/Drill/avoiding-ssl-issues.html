Avoiding Common SSL Issues

   The following sections provide insight to some common error messages
   that you may encounter with SSL.

ERROR: No Cipher suites in common.

   This is a general purpose error message that may have many reasons. The
   most common reason is that in order to use certain cipher suites, JSSE
   needs to use the private key stored in the Keystore. If this key is not
   accessible, JSSE filters out all cipher suites that need a private key.
   This effectively prunes out all available cipher suites so that no
   cipher suites match between the client and the server.
   The private key from the keystore may be inaccessible for the following
   reasons:
     * Missing Keystore file
     * Invalid Keystore password
     * Empty key password or a key password that is different from the
       keystore password

   JSSE does not allow a key password that is null or an empty string even
   though it is possible to create a keystore with such a key password.
   Also, JSSE does not provide a system property to specify the key
   password. Drill provides a way to set the key password, but if you are
   using only system properties to configure JSSE, Drill will use the
   *keystore* password. If the keystore password is not the same as the
   key password, the key will again be inaccessible.
     * Corrupt keystore

   You can validate the keystore using keytool.

ERROR: SSL is enabled, but cannot be initialized due to the ‘Cannot recover
key’ exception.

   The key is protected with a password and the provided password is not
   correct.

ERROR: Client connection timeout.

   A client connection can timeout because of networking issues or if
   there is a mismatch between the TLS/SSL configuration on the client and
   server.

   Before trying to debug the TLS/SSL configuration, check if the server
   is reachable from the client.
   If there is a mismatch between the TLS/SSL configuration, the TLS/SSL
   handshake between the client and server will fail. The server will
   silently drop the connection and the client will eventually time out.
   The handshake may fail due to many reasons, including:
    1. The server is configured to enableTLS and the client is not (and
       vice versa).
         a. If the client is not configured to use TLS and the server is,
            the error message will be similar to the following:
Error: Failure in connecting to Drill: org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.RpcException: H
ANDSHAKE_COMMUNICATION : Channel closed /10.10.10.11:49907 <--> hostname/10.10.1
0.11:31010. (state=,code=0)
java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Failure in connecting to Drill: org
.apache.drill.exec.rpc.RpcException: HANDSHAKE_COMMUNICATION : Channel closed /1
0.10.10.11:49907 <-->hostname/10.10.10.11:31010.

         b. If the server is not configured to use TLS and the client
            tries to connect using TLS, the error message will be similar
            to the following:
Error: Failure in connecting to Drill: org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.NonTransientRpc
Exception: Connecting to the server timed out. This is sometimes due to a mismat
ch in the SSL configuration between client and server. [ Exception: Timeout wait
ing for task.] (state=,code=0)

    2. The server presents a certificate to the client containing a
       hostname that is not valid. When the client connects to a server,
       the hostname the client used to connect to the server must match
       the name of the host the certificate was assigned to. Certificates
       can contain wildcards for the hostname, so if you’re connecting to
       a Drill cluster via ZooKeeper, it would be best to have a
       certificate that contains wildcards that cover all the hosts on
       which Drill might be running. It is also important to ensure that
       the DNS and the hostnames of the machines in the cluster are set up
       consistently so that the Drillbits are registered with ZooKeeper
       using the same name as the name assigned in the certificate. The
       error message in this case is the same as the previous case:
Error: Failure in connecting to Drill: org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.NonTransientRpc
Exception: Connecting to the server timed out. This is sometimes due to a mismat
ch in the SSL configuration between client and server. [ Exception: Timeout wait
ing for task.] (state=,code=0)

       Hostname verification can be turned off if there is no way to
       change the host configuration or the certificate. This is generally
       not recommended.
