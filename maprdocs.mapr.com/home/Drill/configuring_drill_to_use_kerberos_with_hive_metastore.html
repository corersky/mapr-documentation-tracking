Configuring Drill to Use Kerberos with Hive Metastore

   To configure Drill to use Kerberos with the Hive metastore, modify the
   hive storage plugin in the Drill Web UI and then restart the Warden
   service.
   Note: When you configure Drill to use Kerberos with the Hive metastore,
   Drill submits requests to the Hive metastore as the mapr superuser. If
   you want Drill to submit requests to the Hive metastore as any other
   user, configure [1]Drill impersonation with Hive instead of performing
   this task. Drill impersonation works with or without Kerberos
   configured for the Hive metastore.

Prerequisites

   The configurations described in this document have the following
   dependencies:
     * MapR clueter.
     * Drill installed with Drillbits running as the mapr user.
     * Supported version of Hive installed with the following:
          + Hive Metastore configured to use Kerberos authentication
          + Configured Hive remote metastore repository
       Note: See the [2]Drill Support Matrix for supported versions of
       Hive.

Modify the Hive Storage Plugin in Drill

   Modify the Hive storage plugin configuration in the Drill Web UI based
   on the authorization and security scenario for the cluster. You can
   only access the Drill Web UI for a running Drillbit.

   Complete the following steps to configure Drill to use Kerberos with
   Hive Metastore:
    1. Navigate to http://<drillbit_hostname>:8047, and select the Storage
       tab.
       Note: You can only access the Drill Web UI for a running Drillbit.
    2. Click Update next to the hive option.
    3. In the configuration window, add the hive.metastore.sasl.enabled,
       hive.metastore.kerberos.principal, and
       hive.security.authorization.enabled properties, as shown below, if
       configuration does not contain them already. Note that other
       properties shown may or may not be required in your environment:
{
  "type": "hive",
  "enabled": true,
  "configProps": {
    "hive.metastore.uris": "thrift://<metastore_hostname>:9083",
    "fs.default.name": "maprfs:///",
    "hive.server2.enable.doAs": "false",
    "hive.metastore.sasl.enabled": "true",
    "hive.metastore.kerberos.principal": "<metastore_server_principal_name>",
    "hive.security.authorization.enabled": "true"
  }
}

Restart Warden

   Issue the following command on all nodes to restart the Warden service:
service mapr-warden restart

   If you have clush installed, you can run the following command to
   restart Warden on all nodes at once:
clush â€“a "service mapr-warden restart"
