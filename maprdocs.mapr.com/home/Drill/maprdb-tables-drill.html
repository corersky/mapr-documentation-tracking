MapR-DB Tables

   The maprdb format plugin enables you to query binary and JSON tables
   like you would query files in a file system because MapR-DB and MapR-FS
   share the same namespace.

   Binary tables differ from JSON tables in that they store a
   multi-dimensional map in which both keys and values are a sequence of
   bytes. JSON tables store [1]OJAI documents. JSON tables support rich
   data types, including complex and repeated types, that enable database
   servers to evaluate filter conditions for optimized query execution.
   Binary tables can pose performance limitations because the table
   columns do not contain the necessary type information.
   You can query tables stored in any directory in MapR-DB using the same
   syntax that you use to select from files in MapR-FS. Instead of
   including the path of a file in a query, you include the table path.
   The user running the query must have [2]read permission to access the
   MapR table.
   Note: MapR-DB is a case sensitive data source. To ensure that your
   queries return results, use the case that corresponds to the column
   names in the JSON tables and views that you query. For example, if you
   query the “age” column in a JSON table, the query must reference the
   column as “age” and cannot reference the column as “AGE” or the query
   will not return results. If you have a dataset where a column name has
   mixed cases, such as “age” and “AGE,” cleanse the data set so column
   names consist of one case and then reimport the data into the table to
   ensure a complete result set when you query the column.

   The following sections describe the types of tables that MapR-DB
   supports, provide examples of Drill queries on each type of table, and
   show you how to load data into a JSON table from JSON files.
