Multiple Drill Clusters within YARN

   You can define multiple Drill clusters within a single YARN cluster.
   Each Drill cluster is a collection of drillbits that work as an
   independent unit. For example, you might define one test Drill cluster
   that consists of a few machines on the same physical cluster that runs
   larger Drill clusters for development and marketing.

   You must assign each Drill cluster a distinct ZooKeeper entry. Drill
   uses ZooKeeper to coordinate activities. Each Drill cluster also needs
   a distinct set of ports because YARN may launch drillbits from
   different clusters on the same physical node.
   The following steps summarize the process for defining multiple Drill
   clusters on a single YARN cluster:
    1. Create a new site directory.
    2. Configure Drill.
    3. Configure Drill-on-YARN.
    4. Start the cluster.

   The following task provides instructions for each of the steps required
   to configure and run multiple Drill clusters under YARN:
