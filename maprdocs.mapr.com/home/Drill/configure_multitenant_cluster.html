Configuring a Multitenant Cluster

   Drill operations are memory and CPU-intensive. Currently, Drill
   resources are managed outside of any cluster management service, such
   as the MapR warden service. In a multitenant or any other type of
   cluster, YARN-enabled or not, you configure memory and memory usage
   limits for Drill by modifying drill-env.sh as described in the section,
   "[1]Configuring Drill Memory" in Apache Drill documentation.
   Configure a multitenant cluster to account for resources required for
   Drill. For example, on a MapR cluster, ensure warden accounts for
   resources required for Drill. Configuring drill-env.sh allocates
   resources for Drill to use during query execution, while configuring
   the following properties in warden-drill-bits.conf prevents warden from
   committing the resources to other processes.
service.heapsize.min=<some value in MB>
service.heapsize.max=<some value in MB>
service.heapsize.percent=<a whole number>

   Set the service.heapsize properties in warden.drill-bits.conf
   regardless of whether you changed defaults in drill-env.sh or not.

   [2]"Configuring Drill in a YARN-enabled MapR Cluster" shows an example
   of setting the service.heapsize properties. The
   service.heapsize.percent is the percentage of memory for the service
   bounded by minimum and maximum values. Typically, users change
   service.heapsize.percent because using a percentage setting increases
   or decreases resources according to different node configurations. For
   more information about the service.heapsize properties, see the
   section, "[3]warden.<servicename>.conf."
   You need to statically partition the cluster to designate which
   partition handles which workload. To configure resources for Drill in a
   MapR cluster, modify one or more of the files created by the
   installation process in /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d:
warden.drill-bits.conf
warden.nodemanager.conf
warden.resourcemanager.conf

   Configure Drill memory by modifying warden.drill-bits.conf in YARN and
   non-YARN clusters. Configure other resources by modifying
   warden.nodemanager.conf and warden.resourcemanager.conf in a
   YARN-enabled cluster.

Configuring Drill in a YARN-enabled MapR Cluster

   To add Drill to a YARN-enabled cluster, change memory resources to suit
   your application. For example, you have 120G of available memory that
   you allocate to following workloads in a Yarn-enabled cluster:

   File system = 20G Yarn = 20G OS = 8G

   If Yarn does most of the work, give Drill 20G, for example, and give
   Yarn 60G. If you expect a heavy query load, give Drill 60G and Yarn
   20G.

   YARN consists of two main services:
     * ResourceManager: There is at least one instance in a cluster, more
       if you configure high availability.
     * NodeManager: There is one instance per node.

   The warden.resourcemanager.conf and warden.nodemanager.conf files set
   ResourceManager and NodeManager memory to the following defaults:
service.heapsize.min=64
service.heapsize.max=325
service.heapsize.percent=2

   Change these settings for NodeManager and ResourceManager to
   reconfigure the total memory required for YARN services to run. If you
   want to place an upper limit on memory, set the
   YARN_NODEMANAGER_HEAPSIZE or YARN_RESOURCEMANAGER_HEAPSIZE environment
   variable in
 /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.5.1/etc/hadoop/yarn-env.sh

   You do not set the -Xmx option, allowing memory to grow as needed.

MapReduce Version 2 and other Resources

   You configure memory for each service by setting three values in
   warden.conf.
service.command.<servicename>.heapsize.percent
service.command.<servicename>.heapsize.max
service.command.<servicename>.heapsize.min

   [4]Configure memory for other services in the same manner. For more
   information about managing memory in a MapR cluster, see the following
   sections:
     * [5]Memory Allocation for Nodes
     * [6]Cluster Resource Allocation

How to Manage Drill CPU Resources

   Currently, you do not manage CPU resources within Drill. Use Linux
   [7]cgroups to manage the CPU resources.
