Hive to Drill Type Mapping

   Using Drill you can read tables created in Hive that use data types in
   the [1]Hive-to-Drill type mapping table. The Hive version used in MapR
   supports the Hive timestamp in Unix Epoch format. Currently, the Apache
   Hive version used by Drill does not support this timestamp format. The
   workaround is to use the JDBC format for the timestamp, which Hive
   accepts and Drill uses, as shown in the [2]type mapping example.

   For more information about connecting Drill to data sources, refer to
   [3]Connect to Data Sources on the [4]Apache Drill documentation web
   site. For information about workspaces, refer to [5]Workspaces.
