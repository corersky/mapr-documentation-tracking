Configuring SPNEGO on the Client

   An administrator or user can configure SPNEGO on the client (web
   browser or client tools, such as curl). To configure SPNEGO on the
   client, a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket must exist for the user
   accessing the web server. The Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket generated
   on the client side is used by the web client to get a service ticket
   from the KDC. This service ticket is used to generate a SPNEGO token,
   which is presented to the web server for authentication.

   The client should use the same web server hostname (as configured in
   the server-side principal) to access the Drill Web Console. If the
   server hostname differs, SPNEGO authentication will fail. For example,
   if the server principal is "HTTP/example.QA.LAB@QA.LAB", the client
   should use http://example.QA.LAB:8047 as the Drill Web Console URL.

   The following sections provide instructions for configuring the
   supported client-side browsers:

Firefox

   To configure Firefox to use a negotiation dialog, such as SPNEGO to
   authenticate, complete the following steps:
    1. Go to About > Config, and accept the warnings.
    2. Navigate to the network settings.
    3. Set network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris to
       "http://,[1]https://".
    4. Set network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris to “http://,[2]https://”.

Chrome

   For MacOS or Linux, add the --auth-server-whitelist parameter to the
   google-chrome command. For example, to run Chrome from a Linux prompt,
   run the google-chrome command, as shown:
 google-chrome --auth-server-whitelist = "hostname/domain"
   Example: google-chrome --auth-server-whitelist = "example.QA.LAB"

Safari

   No configuration is required for Safari. Safari automatically
   authenticates using SPNEGO when requested by the server.

Internet Explorer

   To configure Internet Explorer to use a negotiation dialog, such as
   SPNEGO to authenticate, complete the following steps:
    1. Go to Tools > Options > Security > Local Intranet > Sites, and
       select all options.
    2. Select Advanced, and add one or both of the following URLs to
       server:
          + http://
          + https://
            Note: Make sure you use the hostname of the Drillbit in the
            URL.
    3. Close the Advanced tab, and click OK.
    4. Go to Tools > Options > Advanced > Security (in the checkbox list),
       and enable the Integrated Windows Authentication option.
    5. Click OK.
    6. Close and reopen IE. You can browse to your Spengo protected
       resource.

REST API

   You can use CURL commands to authenticate using SPNEGO and access
   secure web resources over REST.
   Issue the following curl command to log in using SPNEGO, and save the
   authenticated session cookie to a file, such as cookie.txt, as shown:
curl -v --negotiate -c cookie.txt -u : http://<hostname>:8047/spnegoLogin

   Use the authenticated session cookie stored in the file, for example
   cookie.txt, to access the Drill Web Console pages, as shown in the
   following example:
curl -v --negotiate -b cookie.txt -u : http://<hostname>:8047/query
   Example: curl -v --negotiate -b cookie.txt -u : http://example.QA.LAB:8047/qu
