Connecting to a Drillbit

   The following is the format of a connection URL for connecting to a
   Drillbit, where host is the DNS or IP address of the server:
jdbc:drill:Drillbit=<host>

   Note: Properties are case-sensitive. Do not duplicate properties in the
   connection URL.

   Optional Settings

   You can specify optional settings such as the number of the TCP port to
   connect to or any of the connection properties supported by the driver.
   By default, the driver connects to port 31010. For a list of the
   properties available in the driver, see .

   The following is the format of a connection URL that specifies some
   optional settings:
jdbc:drill:Drillbit=<host>:<port>;
<property1>=<value>;
<property2>=<value>;...

   Example

   To connect to port 31500 on a Drillbit and authenticate the connection
   with Plain authentication (a username and password), you would use the
   following connection URL:
jdbc:drill:Drillbit=192.168.1.1:31500;
auth=PLAIN;
UID=<username>;
PWD=<password>
