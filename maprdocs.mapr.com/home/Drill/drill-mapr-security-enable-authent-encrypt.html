MapR Security (Tickets)

   Drill supports authentication and encryption through the MapR Security
   (tickets) security mechanism. Authentication is the process of
   establishing confidence of authenticity. Encryption is the process of
   converting information or data from plain text into ciphertext to
   prevent unauthorized access. An administrator can manually configure
   Drill to use MapR Security. When MapR Security is enabled, all Drill
   clients, such as JDBC and ODBC, must connect to Drillbits through MapR
   Security.
   The MapR Security mechanism secures the communication path between the
   Drill client, such as JDBC/ODBC and Drillbit, Drillbit and ZooKeeper,
   and also between Drillbits.
   Note: The Drill web communication path (web client to web server) does
   not support MapR Security-based authentication and encryption.
   Note: The Apache JDBC driver packaged with Drill does not support MapR
   Security.

   Configuration parameters in the Drill startup configuration file,
   /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf, enable or
   disable authentication and encryption.
   Prerequisites
     * Ensure that your MapR cluster is secure. To manually configure
       secure clusters with MapR security, see [1]Enable Wire-Level
       Security.
     * When you configure Drill to use encryption, authentication must
       also be configured and enabled with the encryption-specific
       configurations.
     * For encryption and authentication to work together, the Drill
       client and Drillbits must all run Drill 1.11 or later. Drill
       clients running earlier versions of Drill cannot connect to
       Drillbits when encryption is enabled.
     * The client-side should have created a user mapr ticket for the
       authenticating user. See [2]maprlogin for more information.

   Post-requisite
   You must restart the Drillbit process on each node after you enable
   security and/or modify the configuration options, as shown:
$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <node host names
 separated by a space>

   Download and configure the MapR-specific JDBC or ODBC Drill drivers.
   See [3]Drill Drivers for more information.

   The following topics provide configuration information to enable
   authentication and encryption in Drill:
