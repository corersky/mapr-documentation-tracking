Step 5: Configure Multiple Drill Clusters

   Update the /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf
   file on each Drill node that is part of a cluster with the cluster ID
   and a ZooKeeper entry to define the Drill cluster. Each Drill cluster
   should have a unique cluster ID and ZooKeeper entry to separate the
   clusters.
   Note: Each Drill node in a cluster must have the same configuration.

   The Drillbit process reads the configuration file and communicates with
   ZooKeeper to see if the cluster it belongs to exists. If yes, ZooKeeper
   says to join the cluster, if no, the Drillbit initiates a new drill
   cluster based on the cluster ID.
   The following table provides an example of unique cluster IDs and
   ZooKeeper entries based on the topologies in the image above:
   Cluster                  Nodes            Cluster ID ZooKeeper Entry
   QS1

   10.10.100.1

   10.10.100.2

   cluster-id: "drillbits"
   zk.root: "drill"
   D1

   10.10.100.3

   10.10.100.4

   10.10.100.5

   10.10.100.6

   10.10.100.7

   10.10.100.8

   10.10.100.9

   10.10.100.10
   cluster-id: "drillbits2" zk.root: "drill2"
   For QS1, drill-override.conf must include the following configuration:
drill.exec: {
  zk.root: "drill",
  cluster-id: "drillbits",
  zk.connect: "<zk-node-ip-address>:5181",
}

   For D1, drill-override.conf must include the following configuration:
drill.exec: {
  zk.root: "drill2",
  cluster-id: "drillbits2",
  zk.connect: "<zk-node-ip-address>:5181",
}

   Note: If you installed Drill to run under YARN, follow the steps in
   [1]Defining Multiple Drill Clusters Under YARN for each Drill node.
   Drill running under YARN requires some additional steps, such changing
   ZooKeeper ports.
