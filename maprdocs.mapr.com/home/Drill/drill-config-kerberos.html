Configuring Authentication and Encryption

   To enable authentication and encryption, you must create a Kerberos
   principal identity and a keytab file. You add the principal and keytab
   file to <DRILLINSTALL_HOME>/conf/drill-override.conf with the specified
   configuration parameters. In addition, you can configure a mapping from
   a Kerberos principal to a Drill user account. This mapping is used by a
   Drillbit to convert an authenticated client principal to a
   corresponding Kerberos short name, which is used to determine
   administrator privileges for the client principal. After you complete
   the configuration steps, restart the Drillbit.
   To enable authentication and encyption using the Kerberos mechanism,
   configure the following Kerberos-specific parameters in
   drill-override.conf:
   Note: Only Drill 1.11 and later supports encryption.
   Note: For client-side configuration, see [1]Drill Drivers.
   Parameters Communication Path Description Default
   drill.exec.security.auth.principal Drill client (ODBC/JDBC) to Drillbit
   String representation of the Kerberos principal used by the Drillbit
   service. N/A
   drill.exec.security.auth.keytab Drill client (ODBC/JDBC) to Drillbit
   Location of the keytab file for the configured Drillbit service
   principal.
   Note: The Kerberos keytab file that contains the encrypted key for the
   Drillbit service principal. The file should be readable by the Drillbit
   process user.
   N/A
   drill.exec.security.auth.auth_to_local Drill client (ODBC/JDBC) to
   Drillbit Custom rules to convert the Kerberos principal to the Kerberos
   short name.
   Note: Drill uses a Hadoop Kerberos name and rules to transform the
   Kerberos principal provided by client to the one it will use internally
   as the client’s identity. This client identity is used to determine
   administrator privileges. See [2]Mapping from Kerberos Principal to OS
   user account in the [3]Hadoop in Secure Mode documentation for details
   about how the rule works.
   The primary name of the Kerberos principal. By default, this mapping
   rule extracts the first part from the provided principal. For example,
   if the principal format is <Name1>/<Name2>@realm, the default rule
   extracts only Name1 from the principal and Name1 as the client’s
   identity on server side.
   drill.exec.security.user.encryption.sasl.enabled Drill client
   (ODBC/JDBC) to Drillbit Enables/disables encryption for the
   communication path between the Drill client and Drillbit. false
   drill.exec.security.bit.auth.use_login_principal Drilbit to Drillbit
   When set to true, the Drillbit uses the same logged in service
   principal configured with drill.exec.security.auth.principal for the
   Drillbit to Drillbit communication paths. When this parameter is set to
   false, a principal is constructed using the hostname from ZooKeeper for
   the remote Drillbit and keeping the primary and realm information the
   same as the logged in principal set by
   drill.exec.security.auth.principal . false
   drill.exec.security.bit.encryption.sasl.enabled Drillbit to Drillbit
   Enables/disables encryption for the communication path between the
   Drillbits. false

Steps to Enable Kerberos Authentication and Encryption

   Complete the following steps to enable Drill to use Kerberos for
   authentication and encryption:
    1. Create a Kerberos principal identity and a keytab file. You can
       create one principal for each Drillbit or one principal for all
       Drillbits in a cluster.
       Note: The adminstrator must own the drill.keytab file and have the
       ability to read the file.
          + For a single principal per node in cluster:
    # kadmin
    : addprinc -randkey <username>/<FQDN>@<REALM>.COM
    : ktadd -k /opt/mapr/conf/drill.keytab <username>/<FQDN>@<REALM>.COM

          + For a single principal per cluster, use <clustername> instead
            of <FQDN>:
    # kadmin
    : addprinc -randkey <username>/<clustername>@<REALM>.COM
    : ktadd -k /opt/mapr/conf/drill.keytab <username>/<clustername>@<REALM>.COM
       Note: The instance name must be lowercase. If _HOST is set as the
       instance name in the principal, it is replaced with the fully
       qualified domain name of that host for the instance name. For
       example, if a Drillbit running on host01.aws.lab uses
       drill/_HOST@<EXAMPLE>.COM as the principal, the canonicalized
       principal is drill/host01.aws.lab@<EXAMPLE>.COM.
    2. Add the Kerberos principal identity, keytab file, and parameters
       specific to Kerberos to the drill-override.conf file. You can use
       the following configuration examples for enabling authentication,
       encryption, or both between the Drill client and Drillbit and
       between Drillbits.

        Example 1: Enabling Kerberos Authentication Between the Drill
                Client and Drillbit

      drill.exec: {
        cluster-id: "drillbits1",
        zk.connect: "qa102-81.qa.lab:5181,qa102-82.qa.lab:5181,qa102-83.qa.lab:5
181",
        impersonation: {
          enabled: true,
          max_chained_user_hops: 3
        },
        security: {
                user.auth.enabled:true,
                auth.mechanisms:["KERBEROS"],
                auth.principal:"drill/<clustername>@<REALM>.COM",
                auth.keytab:"/etc/drill/conf/drill.keytab"
              }
        }

        Example 2: Enabling Kerberos Authentication and Encryption Between
                the Drill Client and Drillbit

      drill.exec: {
        cluster-id: "drillbits1",
        zk.connect: "qa102-81.qa.lab:5181,qa102-82.qa.lab:5181,qa102-83.qa.lab:5
181",
        impersonation: {
          enabled: true,
          max_chained_user_hops: 3
        },
        security: {
                user.auth.enabled:true,
                auth.mechanisms:["KERBEROS"],
                auth.principal:"drill/<clustername>@<REALM>.COM",
                auth.keytab:"/etc/drill/conf/drill.keytab",
             user.encryption.sasl.enabled: true
              }
            }
        }

        Example 3: Enabling Kerberos Authentication Between Drill Client
                and Drillbits and Between Drillbits

      drill.exec: {
        cluster-id: "drillbits1",
        zk.connect: "qa102-81.qa.lab:5181,qa102-82.qa.lab:5181,qa102-83.qa.lab:5
181",
        impersonation: {
          enabled: true,
          max_chained_user_hops: 3
        },
        security: {
                user.auth.enabled:true,
                auth.mechanisms:["KERBEROS"],
                auth.principal:"drill/<clustername>@<REALM>.COM",
                auth.keytab:"/etc/drill/conf/drill.keytab"
              }
        security.bit: {
                auth.enabled: true,
                auth.mechanism: "Kerberos",
                auth.use_login_principal: true
               }
        }

        Example 4: Enabling Kerberos Authentication and Encryption Between
                Drill Client and Drillbits and Between Drillbits

      drill.exec: {
        cluster-id: "drillbits1",
        zk.connect: "qa102-81.qa.lab:5181,qa102-82.qa.lab:5181,qa102-83.qa.lab:5
181",
        impersonation: {
          enabled: true,
          max_chained_user_hops: 3
        },
        security: {
                user.auth.enabled:true,
                auth.mechanisms:["KERBEROS"],
                auth.principal:"drill/<clustername>@<REALM>.COM",
                auth.keytab:"/etc/drill/conf/drill.keytab",
                user.encryption.sasl.enabled: true
              }
        security.bit: {
                auth.enabled: true,
                auth.mechanism: "Kerberos",
                auth.use_login_principal: true,
                encryption.sasl.enabled: true
               }
        }

                Note: In examples 3 and 4 above, the Drillbit will use the
                same logged in service principal as configured in
                drill.exec.security.auth.principal.

        Example 5: Enabling Kerberos Authentication and Encryption Between
                Drill Client and Drillbits and Between Drillbits. For
                Drillbit to Drillbit authentication, where the service
                principal is created using the hostname from ZooKeeper for
                a remote Drillbit as an instance name. The primary and the
                realm component of the service principal is used from the
                drill.exec.security.auth.principal parameter.

      drill.exec: {
        cluster-id: "drillbits1",
        zk.connect: "qa102-81.qa.lab:5181,qa102-82.qa.lab:5181,qa102-83.qa.lab:5
181",
        impersonation: {
          enabled: true,
          max_chained_user_hops: 3
        },
        security: {
                user.auth.enabled:true,
                auth.mechanisms:["KERBEROS"],
                auth.principal:"drill/<clustername>@<REALM>.COM",
                auth.keytab:"/etc/drill/conf/drill.keytab",
                user.encryption.sasl.enabled: true
              }
        security.bit: {
                auth.enabled: true,
                auth.mechanism: "Kerberos",
                encryption.sasl.enabled: true
               }
        }

                Note: For the configuration in example 5, if the hostname
                of the remote Drillbit known to ZooKeeper is
                host01.aws.lab, then the service principal used by a
                Drillbit to authenticate with the remote Drillbit will be
                drill/host01.aws.lab@<REALM>.COM.

    3. Restart the Drillbit process on each Drill node.
$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <node host names
 separated by a space>
