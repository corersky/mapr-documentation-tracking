Configuring Drill to Use libjpam

   You can configure Drill to use libjpam for Plain authentication between
   a client, such as ODBC, and the Drillbit.
   To configure Drill to use libjpam, complete the following steps:
    1. Copy the libjpam.so file from /opt/mapr/lib to a directory that
       does not contain other Hadoop components, for example /opt/pam/.
    2. Add the following line to
       /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-env.sh, including the
       directory where the libjpam.so file is located, as shown:
export DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS="$DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS -Djava.library.path=<directory>"
Example: export DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS="$DRILLBIT_JAVA_OPTS -Djava.library.path=/opt
/pam/"
    3. Add the following configuration to the drill.exec block in
       /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf:
drill.exec: {
             cluster-id: "drillbits1",
             zk.connect: "qa102-81.qa.lab:5181,qa102-82.qa.lab:5181,qa102-83.qa.
lab:5181",
             impersonation: {
               enabled: true,
               max_chained_user_hops: 3
          },
             security: {
                auth.mechanisms : ["PLAIN"],
                 },
              security.user.auth: {
                enabled: true,
                packages += "org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.user.security",
                impl: "pam",
                pam_profiles: [ "sudo", "login", "mapr-admin" ]
         }
       }

    4. (Optional) To add or remove different PAM profiles, add or delete
       the profile names in the pam_profiles array portion of the
       configuration:
pam_profiles: [ "sudo", "login" ]
    5. Restart the Drillbit process on each Drill node, as shown:
/opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/bin/drillbit.sh restart
