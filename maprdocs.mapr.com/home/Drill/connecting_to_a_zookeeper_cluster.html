Connecting to a ZooKeeper Cluster

   The following is the format of a connection URL for connecting to a
   ZooKeeper cluster, where serverlist is a comma-separated list of
   servers in your ZooKeeper cluster, and clustername is the unique name
   of the drillbit cluster that you want to use:
jdbc:drill:zk=<serverlist>/drill/<clustername>

   Optionally, you can specify any of the connection properties supported
   by the driver. For a list of the properties available in the driver,
   see .

   Optional Settings

   The following is the format of a connection URL that specifies some
   optional settings:
jdbc:drill:zk=<serverlist>/drill/<clustername><clustername>;
<property1>=<value><value>;
<property2>=<value><value>;...

   Example

   To connect to a ZooKeeper cluster and authenticate the connection with
   Plain authentication (a username and password), you would use the
   following connection URL:
jdbc:drill:zk=192.168.39.43:5181, 192.168.1.1:31010/drill/drillbits1;
auth=PLAIN;
UID=<username>;
PWD=<password>
