Step 1: Configure Drill

   Drill configuration under Drill-on-YARN differs from Drill
   configuration under Warden. You must create a site directory to contain
   the site-specific files for Drill. Drill-on-YARN copies the site
   directory to every node so that each node has the configuration
   settings. Having a site directory also simplifies upgrades because you
   can just delete the old Drill distribution and install the new one
   while the site-specific files remain unchanged in the site directory.

   The drill-env.sh file contains only custom configurations.
   MapR-specific configuration settings reside in distrib-env.sh, a file
   separate from the site-specific settings. When you migrate an existing
   Drill installation to run under YARN, you must modify the drill-env.sh
   to remove the Drill and MapR settings, leaving only your site-specific
   settings.
   When you finish configuring Drill, use the site directory to test
   Drill, including starting, checking status, and stopping Drill.
   Note: If you installed the mapr-drill-yarn package on nodes other than
   the Drill-on-YARN client in order to make SQLLine accessible to users,
   the site directory must be accessible from all nodes. You can copy the
   configurations across all the nodes, as you did when you ran Drill
   under the Warden service. Alternatively, you can put the site directory
   in a shared file system nfs mount to extend the configuration. When
   users launch SQLLine, they should provide the ZooKeeper connection
   string to launch Drill.

Create the Site Directory

   To create the “site” directory, complete the following steps as the
   same user that installed Drill and will run the Drill-on-YARN client
   application:
    1. Create the site directory and an environment variable for the
       directory:
export DRILL_SITE=/opt/mapr/drill/site
mkdir $DRILL_SITE
       Note: The variable is not required and used for convenience in the
       documentation.
    2. Copy the drill-env.sh, drill-override.conf, drill-on-yarn.conf, and
       distrib-env.sh files from $DRILL_HOME/conf/ into the site
       directory. In the following example, $DRILL_HOME is the location of
       the new Drill installation (usually
       /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>).
cp $DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-override.conf $DRILL_SITE
cp $DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-env.sh $DRILL_SITE
cp $DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-on-yarn.conf $DRILL_SITE
cp $DRILL_HOME/conf/distrib-env.sh $DRILL_SITE
       Note: Copy any configuration changes from drill-env.sh file in the
       previous Drill installation over to the drill-env.sh file in the
       site directory. Do not include the memory settings when you copy
       over your previous configurations. These changes must be made in
       the drill-on-yarn.conf file described in Step 3: Configure YARN to
       Run Drill.
       Note: Never modify distrib-env.sh. The distrib-env.sh script
       contains MapR settings that you should not change. You copy this
       file to the site directory because it often contains values set
       during Drill installation. When you upgrade Drill, replace the file
       with the latest version from $DRILL_HOME/conf.
    3. If you developed custom code (data sources or user-defined
       functions), place the Java JAR files in $DRILL_SITE/jars. If you
       have code from your prior Drill installation, copy the JAR files
       from $PREV_DRILL/jars/3rdparty to $DRILL_SITE/jars.
cp $PREV_DRILL/jars/3rdparty/yourJarName.jar $DRILL_SITE/jars
       Note: Copy only the JAR files that you added. Do not copy JAR files
       that shipped with the prior Drill version.
    4. Add native libraries to the site directory. If you used a native
       library, such as the JPAM library, in prior versions of Drill,
       place the native libraries in $DRILL_SITE/lib to enable YARN to
       automatically copy (localize) them to each node that runs Drill.
cp native_libraries $DRILL_SITE/lib

Modify the drill-env.sh File

   Copy any configuration changes from drill-env.sh file in the previous
   Drill installation over to the drill-env.sh file in the site directory.
   Memory settings under Drill-on-YARN are now part of the
   drill-on-yarn.conf file. Modify the memory settings in
   $DRILL_SITE/drill-env.sh, as shown below, to ensure that the Drill
   memory settings match the amount of memory that Drill-on-YARN requires.

   To modify drill-env.sh, complete the following steps:
    1. Review each line in $PREV_DRILL/conf/drill-env.sh for settings you
       added, and copy them into the new $DRILL_SITE/drill-env.sh file.
       Note: If you do not recall whether you customized settings, you can
       compare your file with the original version of drill-env.sh that
       shipped with the prior Drill version.
    2. Locate the following lines in drill-env.sh and note the values:
DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY="<value>"
DRILL_HEAP="<value>"
       Replace those lines with the following lines, substituting the
       values in the new lines with the values from the old lines:
export DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY=${DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY:-"<value>"}
export DRILL_HEAP=${DRILL_HEAP:-"<value>"}
       Note: If you do not intend to run Drill outside of YARN, you can
       remove the two lines shown above from drill-env.sh.
       Note: If you do not make this change, Drill ignores the memory
       settings in the drill-on-yarn.conf file. If you are installing
       Drill fresh, and do not have an existing file, you can skip this
       step. Files in Drill 1.8 and later have the correct format.
       Note: When you install Drill, the MapR installer automatically adds
       the HADOOP_HOME variable, which points the current MapR-provided
       Hadoop to your distrib-env.sh. If HADOOP_HOME is located elsewhere,
       change this location in drill-env.sh

Use the Site Directory to Test Drill

   You will use the site directory each time you start Drill using the
   --site or --config option. Use the option to verify that the
   configuration works by starting Drill as a stand-alone service on a
   single node.
drillbit.sh --site $DRILL_SITE start

   Wait a few seconds and then verify that Drill continues to run:
drillbit.sh --site $DRILL_SITE status

   You can also use the Drill Web Console for the Drillbit to verify that
   Drill has the proper settings. Once satisfied that the configuration is
   connect, stop Drill:
drillbit.sh --site $DRILL_SITE stop

   Note: If you find that specifying the --site option becomes tedious,
   you can set the DRILL_CONF_DIR variable in your environment:
export DRILL_CONF_DIR="$DRILL_SITE"
drillbit.sh start
