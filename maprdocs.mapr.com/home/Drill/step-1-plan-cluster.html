Step 1: Plan the Clusters

   Decide which nodes in the MapR cluster you want to run Drill, and which
   nodes you want to run the OJAI Distributed Query Service.

   The nodes you select to run Drill can form one or more Drill clusters,
   while the nodes you select to run the OJAI Distributed Query Service
   can form another Drill cluster. You can configure multiple Drill
   clusters.
   For example, if you have a ten node MapR cluster, you can configure one
   Drill cluster to run analytical queries and one OJAI Distributed Query
   Service cluster to run OJAI operational queries, as shown:

   Note: Track the nodes that you want to group into a cluster, as this
   information is needed to configure node topology and volumes. Also note
   the memory requirements of each service.
   Note: Only non-overlapping Drill clusters are supported. You cannot
   install more than one Drillbit on a MapR server node.
