Configuring Inbound Impersonation

   Administrators can configure inbound impersonation. You can define
   administrative users through the security.admin.user_groups and
   security.admin.users options.
   Complete the following steps to enable inbound impersonation:
    1. If user impersonation is not enabled, you must enable it before
       configuring inbound impersonation. To enable user impersonation,
       edit /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/drill-override.conf and set
       the option to true, as shown:
{
      drill.exec.impersonation.enabled: true,
      ...
      }
    2. Define inbound impersonation policies. For example, the following
       ALTER SYSTEM statement authorizes:
          + puser1 to impersonate any user (use * as a wildcard character)
          + puser2 to impersonate euser1 and all users in egroup2
          + all users in pgroup3 to impersonate all users in egroup3
ALTER SYSTEM SET `exec.impersonation.inbound_policies`='[
  { proxy_principals : { users: ["puser1"] },
    target_principals: { users: ["*"] } },
  { proxy_principals : { users: ["puser2"] },
    target_principals: { users: ["euser1"], groups :  ["egroup2"] } },
  { proxy_principals : { groups: ["pgroup3"] },
    target_principals: { groups: ["egroup3"] } } ]';
       Policy format:
{ proxy_principals : { users : ["...", "..."], groups : ["...", "..."] },
  target_principals: { users : ["...", "..."], groups : ["...", "..."] } }
    3. Ensure that the proxy user (application) passes the username of the
       impersonation target user to Drill when creating a connection
       through the impersonation_target connection property. For example,
       through sqlline:
bin/sqlline â€“u "jdbc:drill:schema=dfs;zk=myclusterzk;impersonation_target=euser1
" -n puser1 -p ppass1

   Note: In this example, puser1 is the user submitting the queries. This
   user is authenticated. Since this user is authorized to impersonate any
   user, queries through the established connection are run as euser1.
