Installing the Drill Sandbox

Prerequisites

   The MapR Sandbox with Drill runs on VMware Player and VirtualBox
   (recommended), free desktop applications that you can use to run a
   virtual machine on a Windows, Mac, or Linux PC.

   Before you install the MapR Sandbox with Drill, verify that the host
   system meets the following prerequisites:
     * VMware Player or VirtualBox is installed.
     * At least 20 GB free hard disk space, at least 4 physical cores, and
       8 GB of RAM is available. Performance increases with more RAM and
       free hard disk space.
     * Uses one of the following 64-bit x86 architectures:
     *
          + A 1.3 GHz or faster AMD CPU with segment-limit support in long
            mode
          + A 1.3 GHz or faster Intel CPU with VT-x support
     * If you have an Intel CPU with VT-x support, verify that VT-x
       support is enabled in the host system BIOS. The BIOS settings that
       must be enabled for VT-x support vary depending on the system
       vendor. See the VMware knowledge base article at
       [1]http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003944 for information about how to
       determine if VT-x support is enabled.
