Configuring SPNEGO on the Drillbit (Web Server)

   To configure SPNEGO on the web server, complete the following steps:
    1. Generate a Kerberos principal on each web server that will receive
       inbound SPNEGO traffic. Each principal must have a corresponding
       keytab. The principal must have the following form:
"HTTP/<client-known-server-hostname@realm>"

   Example: "HTTP/example.QA.LAB@QA.LAB"
   //In this example, the client known server hostname is example.QA.LAB.
       Note: If HTTPS is enabled on the Drillbit (web server), the SPNEGO
       principal should also start with "HTTP/", not "HTTPS/" even though
       the URL includes HTTPS.
    2. Update the /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf
       file on each Drillbit with the following server-side SPNEGO
       configurations:
          + To enable SPNEGO, add the following configuration to
            drill-override.conf:
impersonation: {
                    enabled: true,
                    max_chained_user_hops: 3
              },
              drill.exec.http: {
                    spnego.auth.principal:"HTTP/hostname@realm",
                    spnego.auth.keytab:"path/to/keytab",
                    auth.mechanisms: ["SPNEGO"]
              }
      }
      //The default authentication mechanism is "FORM".
          + To enable SPNEGO and FORM authentication, add the following
            configuration to drill-override.conf:
impersonation: {
               enabled: true,
               max_chained_user_hops: 3
             },
             security.user.auth: {
                     enabled: true,
                     packages += "org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.user.security",
                     impl: "pam4j",
                     pam_profiles: [ "sudo", "login" ]
              }
            drill.exec.http: {
                     spnego.auth.principal:"HTTP/hostname@realm",
                     spnego.auth.keytab:"path/to/keytab",
                     auth.mechanisms: ["SPNEGO", "FORM"]
            }
      }
    3. (Optional) To configure the mapping from a Kerberos principal to a
       user account used by Drill, update the
       drill.exec.security.auth.auth_to_local property in the
       drill-override.conf file with custom rules, as described in
       [1]Mapping from Kerberos Principal to OS user account.
       Note: Drill uses a Hadoop Kerberos name and rules to transform the
       client Kerberos principal to the principal Drill uses internally as
       the client’s identity. By default, this mapping rule extracts the
       first portion from the provided principal. For example, if the
       principal format is Name1/Name2@realm, the default rule extracts
       only Name1 from the principal and stores Name1 as the client’s
       identity on server side. Drill uses the short name, for example
       Name1, as the user account known to Drill. This user account name
       is used to determine if the authenticated user has administrative
       privileges.
