Step 3: Define Node Topologies

   Node topologies restrict data to a designated set of nodes. When you
   define a topology, data is only replicated on the nodes within the
   topology. Node topologies improve query performance because data is
   localized to the nodes specified in the topology instead of being
   distributed across the entire MapR cluster.

   You can create node topologies for the Drill clusters in the MapR
   Control System or from the CLI. See [1]Changing Topology for One or
   More Nodes for instrcutions.
   When you create a topology, you define the nodes that form a Drill
   cluster, as shown in the following image:

   The image above shows a topology named T1 for the Drill cluster that
   will ultimately become the OJAI Distributed Query Service cluster and
   T2 for the Drill cluster that will remain a Drill service cluster.
