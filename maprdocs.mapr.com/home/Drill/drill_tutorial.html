Drill Tutorial

   MapR includes Drill as part of the Hadoop distribution. The MapR
   Sandbox with Drill is a fully functional single-node cluster that
   simulates Drill in a Hadoop environment. Business and technical
   analysts, product managers, and developers can use the sandbox
   environment to get a feel for the power and capabilities of Drill by
   performing various types of queries. Refer to the [1]Drill web site and

   Drill by running SQL queries directly on the local file system.
