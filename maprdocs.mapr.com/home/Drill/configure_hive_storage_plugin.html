Configuring the Hive Storage Plugin

   Drill can work with only one version of Hive in a given cluster. To
   access Hive tables using custom SerDes or InputFormat/OutputFormat, all
   nodes running Drill must have the SerDes or InputFormat/OutputFormat
   JAR files in the following location:
   <drill_installation_directory>/jars/3rdparty.
   To query across multiple versions of Hive from Drill, install each
   version of Hive on a separate cluster. For example, you have Drill and
   Hive 0.13 deployed in a production cluster, while a customer is testing
   Hive 1.0 on a test cluster. Drill can query data from Hive tables on
   the test cluster as well as Hive tables on the production cluster. You
   must define separate storage plugins, each corresponding to a specific
   Hive version of the metastore.
   Note: As of Drill 1.13, Drill contains updated Hive libraries with Hive
   version 2.1.1-mapr-1710. With this update, Drill supports queries on
   transactional (ACID) and non-transactional Hive bucketed ORC tables.
   The updated libraries are backward compatible with earlier versions of
   the Hive server and metastore.

   Configuring a Hive Remote Metastore
   A remote Hive metastore configuration runs as a separate service
   outside of Hive. The metastore service communicates with the Hive
   database over JDBC. Point Drill to the Hive metastore service address,
   and provide the connection parameters in the hive storage plugin
   configuration to configure a connection to Drill. The hive storage
   plugin (located on the Storage tab in the Drill Web Console) has the
   following default configuration when you install Drill:
{
 "type": "hive",
 "enabled": true,
 "configProps": {
  "hive.metastore.uris": "",
  "javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL": "jdbc:derby:;databaseName=../sample-data/dri
ll_hive_db;create=true",
  "hive.metastore.warehouse.dir": "/tmp/drill_hive_wh",
  "fs.default.name": "file:///",
  "hive.metastore.sasl.enabled": "false",
  "datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll": "true"
 }
}

   Complete the following steps to modify the default hive storage plugin
   configuration for your MapR-FS environment:
    1. Verify that Hive is running.
    2. Issue the following command to start the Hive metastore service on
       the system specified in the hive.metastore.uris: hive --service
       metastore
    3. [1]Start the Drill Web Console.
    4. Select the Storage tab. If [2]Web Console security is enabled, you
       must have administrator privileges to perform this step.
    5. In the list of disabled storage plugins in the Drill Web Console,
       click Update next to hive.
    6. Update the following hive storage plugin parameters to match the
       system environment:
          + "hive.metstore.uris"
          + "jdbc:<database>://<host:port>/<metastore database>"
          + Change the default location of files to suit your environment.
            For example, change "fs.default.name": "file:///" to the
            MapR-FS location: maprfs:///
          + To run Drill and Hive in a secure MapR cluster, change the
            "hive.metastore.sasl.enabled" parameter to "true".
          + Change the "datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll" property setting
            for your system environment. When enabled,
            "datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll" initializes the Hive
            metastore schema.
               o In a production environment, remove the
                 "datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll" property from the hive
                 storage plugin configuration; the property is not
                 required because the preferred schema information is
                 already created for the Hive metastore service.
               o In a test environment with an embedded Hive metastore,
                 you can disable (set to false) this property after the
                 first query on the Hive data source that you submit from
                 Drill. Alternatively, use the [3]Hive schema tool to
                 initialize or upgrade the Hive metastore schema. Using
                 the Hive schema tool is recommended for queries on
                 transactional tables. Run the schematool command as an
                 initialization step, as shown:
/opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/bin/schematool -dbType <databaseType> -initSchema
    7. Click Enable in the Web Console to enable the Hive storage plugin
       configuration.
