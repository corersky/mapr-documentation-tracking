Connection URL for Plain Authentication using the Apache JDBC Driver to
connect via SQLLine

   When Plain authentication is enabled, each user that accesses the
   Drillbit process through a client, must provide username and password
   credentials for access.

Connecting to Drill from SQLLine

   Include the –n and –p parameters with your username and password when
   launching SQLLine, as shown in the following example:
sqlline –u jdbc:drill:zk=10.10.11.112:5181 –n <username> –p <password>

   Alternatively, you can launch SQLLine and then issue the !connect
   command to hide the password.
   Complete the following steps to hide the password:
    1. Run the sqlline script, as shown:
$ /etc/drill/bin/sqlline

    2. At the prompt, enter the !connect command followed by
 jdbc:drill:zk=zk=<zk name>[:<port>][,<zk name2>[:<port>]...]
       , as shown:
`sqlline> !connect jdbc:drill:zk=localhost:5181 scan complete in 1385m`s
    3. When prompted, enter a username and password; the password is
       hidden as it is typed, as shown:
Enter username for jdbc:drill:zk=localhost:5181: yourusername
Enter password for jdbc:drill:zk=localhost:5181: *************

Connecting to Drill from BI Tools

   When you connect to Drill from a BI tool, such as Tableau, the ODBC
   driver prompts you for the authentication type, username, and password.
   For PAM, select Basic Authentication in the Authentication Type
   drop-down menu.
