Configuring Drill to Run Under YARN

   To run Drill under YARN, you must have the YARN version of Drill
   installed on the node designated as the Drill-on-YARN client. If you
   have not already planned your cluster and installed the YARN-ready
   version of Drill, see [1]Install Drill to Run Under YARN and then
   return to this topic to configure Drill to run as a YARN application.

   Configuring Drill to run under YARN requires modifications to Drill,
   Drill-on-YARN, and YARN configuration files. The following sections
   provide the information needed to make the changes to the

   under YARN and validate the cluster configuration and status of the
   Drill nodes.

   Complete the following steps to configure Drill to run under YARN,
