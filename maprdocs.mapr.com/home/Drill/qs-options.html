Index Planning and Execution Options for Operational Queries

   The following table lists the index planning and execution options for
   operational queries that you can enable, disable, or modify:
   Option Description Default Value Possible Values
   exec.query.progress.update Enable or disable updating transient query
   state in ZooKeeper. Disable this option for short running operational
   queries. When disabled, you do not see the query state , such as
   STARTING and RUNNING in the Drill Web Console. true true|false
   exec.udf.use_dynamic Enable or disable using dynamic UDFs for the
   queries. Disable this option for operational queries. When disabled,
   you cannot use dynamic UDFs for queries. true true|false
   exec.query_profile.save Enable or disable saving query profiles for the
   queries. Disable this option for operational queries. When disabled,
   Drill does not save query profiles and they are not available for
   analysis or debugging. true true|false
   planner.use_simple_optimizer Enable or disable using simple optimizer
   for queries. Simple optimizer applies fewer rules to reduce planning
   time and is meant to be used only for simple operational queries that
   use limit, sort, and filter. This optimizer applies rules for
   leveraging secondary indexes when index planning is enabled. Enable
   this option for operational queries. false true|false
