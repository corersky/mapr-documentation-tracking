Covering and Non-Covering Queries

   Drill uses a cost-based approach to determine an optimal query plan.
   When queries are eligible for index planning, the queries are either
   covering or non-covering.

   For covering queries, only the index is needed to process the query.
   Drill creates an index-based query plan that includes an index scan.
   Covering queries avoid the overhead of fetching data from the primary
   table.
   For non-covering queries, the index only contains a subset of the data
   required to process the query. Drill creates a query plan that includes
   an index scan and a join back to the primary table. In some scenarios,
   a full table scan is more cost efficient than an index scan and Drill
   will not create an index plan.
   Note: (Drill 1.11 only) You must enable the
   planner.index.force_sort_noncovering option for Drill to return the
   results of a non-covering query in sorted order. See [1]Index Planning
   and Execution Configuration Options
   .

   Indexes for covering and non-covering queries can contain indexed
   fields, or a combination of indexed and included fields. MapR-DB stores
   included fields in the index. Each field added to the index increases
   the storage requirement for the index. As the storage size increases,
   the cost of reading the index also increases. Likewise, for the cost of
   adding and updating documents. Consider the impact on storage and
   updates when adding included fields to an index.

       [2]Selection and Execution of Secondary Indexes.

       index-based plans, see [3]Queries that Benefit from Secondary
       Indexes.

Covering and Non-Covering Query Examples

   A query can be covering or non-covering based on the fields referenced
   in the query and the fields on which an index is created and/or
   includes.

   The following query examples use an index, l_comp_1, created on a
   table, lineitem.
   The l_comp_1 index was created using the maprcli table index add
   command, as shown:
maprcli table index add -path /drill/testdata/tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/range/lineite
m -index l_comp_1 -indexedfields L_LINENUMBER,L_ORDERKEY -includedfields L_LINES
TATUS,L_QUANTITY

   Covering Query Example
   The following query references the L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY,
   L_LINENUMBER, and L_ORDERKEY fields in the lineitem table:
SELECT L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHERE L_LINENUMBER = 1 AND L_ORDER
KEY BETWEEN 40 AND 75;

   Because the l_comp_1 index includes all fields referenced in the query,
   Drill creates a query plan that uses the index only.
   Running the [5]EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command with the query shows that Drill
   created a query plan that only uses the index to process the query:
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHERE L_LINENUMBE
R = 1 AND L_ORDERKEY BETWEEN 40 AND 75;

00-00    Screen
00-01      Project(L_LINESTATUS=[$0], L_QUANTITY=[$1])
00-02        Scan(table=[[si, tpch_sf1_maprdb_range, lineitem]], groupscan=[Json
TableGroupScan [ScanSpec=JsonScanSpec [tableName=maprfs:///drill/testdata/tpch/s
f1/maprdb/json/range/lineitem, condition=(((L_LINENUMBER = {"$numberLong":1}) an
d (L_ORDERKEY >= {"$numberLong":40})) and (L_ORDERKEY <= {"$numberLong":75})), i
ndexName=l_comp_1], columns=[`L_LINESTATUS`, `L_QUANTITY`]]])

   Reading the query plan, you can see that the plan includes an index
   scan, as indicated by groupscan=[JsonTableGroupScan and indexName.
   Drill and MapR-DB can process this query using only the index.

   Non-Covering Query Example
   The following query references the L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS,
   L_QUANTITY L_LINENUMBER, and L_ORDERKEY fields in the lineitem table:
SELECT L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHERE L_LINENUMBER =
 1 AND L_ORDERKEY BETWEEN 40 AND 75;

   Because the l_comp_1 index does not include the L_RETURNFLAG field,
   Drill creates a query plan that uses the index, but also includes a
   join on the primary table.
   Running the EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command with the query shows that Drill
   includes an index scan and a table scan:
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT L_RETURNFLAG, L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHE
RE L_LINENUMBER = 1 AND L_ORDERKEY BETWEEN 40 AND 75;

00-00    Screen
00-01      Project(L_RETURNFLAG=[$0], L_LINESTATUS=[$1], L_QUANTITY=[$2])
00-02        Project(L_RETURNFLAG=[$2], L_LINESTATUS=[$3], L_QUANTITY=[$4])
00-03          Project(L_LINENUMBER=[$0], L_ORDERKEY=[$1], L_RETURNFLAG=[$2], L_
LINESTATUS=[$3], L_QUANTITY=[$4])
00-04            RowKeyJoin(condition=[=($5, $6)], joinType=[inner])
00-06              Scan(table=[[si, tpch_sf1_maprdb_range, lineitem]], groupscan
=[RestrictedJsonTableGroupScan [ScanSpec=JsonScanSpec [tableName=maprfs:///drill
/testdata/tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/range/lineitem, condition=(((L_LINENUMBER = {"$nu
mberLong":1}) and (L_ORDERKEY >= {"$numberLong":40})) and (L_ORDERKEY <= {"$numb
erLong":75}))], columns=[`L_LINENUMBER`, `L_ORDERKEY`, `L_RETURNFLAG`, `L_LINEST
ATUS`, `L_QUANTITY`, `_id`], rowcount=60012.15000000001]])
00-05              Scan(table=[[si, tpch_sf1_maprdb_range, lineitem]], groupscan
=[JsonTableGroupScan [ScanSpec=JsonScanSpec [tableName=maprfs:///drill/testdata/
tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/range/lineitem, condition=(((L_LINENUMBER = {"$numberLong":
1}) and (L_ORDERKEY >= {"$numberLong":40})) and (L_ORDERKEY <= {"$numberLong":75
})), indexName=l_comp_1], columns=[`_id`]]])

   Reading the query plan, you can see that the plan includes an index
   scan, as indicated by the groupscan=[JsonTableGroupScan and indexName,
   and also a scan on the primary table, as indicated by the
   groupscan=[RestrictedJsonTableGroupScan and the RowKeyJoin. To process
   this query, Drill and MapR-DB can use the index, but MapR-DB must also
   use the rowkey to perform a join on the primary table to fetch data in
   the L_RETURNFLAG field.

   If this query ran on a regular basis, you could remove the l_comp_1
   index and create a new index that includes all fields referenced in the
   query, including the L_RETURNFLAG field, to improve query performance.
   However, running a query only once or a few times may not justify the
   overhead of removing the old index and creating a new index.
