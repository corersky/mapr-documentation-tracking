Migrate Drill to Run Under YARN

   You can migrate Drill to run under YARN instead of the MapR Warden
   service. When you migrate Drill to run under YARN, you must back up
   configurations, including files and storage plugins, shutdown the Drill
   cluster running under Warden, and uninstall Drill on all Drill nodes in
   the cluster. You may also want to determine which system settings have
   been changed from the Drill defaults.
   Note: Drill-on-YARN is an advanced feature used to manage a production
   Drill cluster. Only skilled Drill and MapR administrators, familiar
   with YARN, should configure Drill to run under YARN. If you are new to
   Drill, consider running Drill under the MapR Warden service until you
   are familiar with Drill and Drill cluster management.

   The sections below provide the tasks required to migrate Drill under
   YARN:

Tasks

   Complete the following tasks when you want to migrate Drill to run
   under YARN:

   Backup configurations and UDFs
          Back up congfiguration files, storage plugin configurations, and
          UDFs (user-defined functions) or custom JAR files. Back up the
          configuration files located in
          /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf, including
          drill-override.conf and drill-env.sh, to preserve your ZooKeeper
          configuration and any options or custom configurations specified
          in the files. Also back up logback.xml if you configured the
          file for the Lilith software.

          + To back up configuration files, go to
            /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf, and copy the files to a
            location outside of the Drill installation directory.
cp <file_name> drill-env.sh /path/to/directory
          + To back up custom JARs or UDFs, go to
            /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/jars/3rdparty and copy the
            JARs ro UDFs to a location outside of the Drill installation
            directory.
          + To back up storage plugin configurations, complete the
            following steps:
              1. [1]Start the Web Console. The Drill node that you use to
                 access the Web Console must be a node that is currently
                 running the Drillbit process.
              2. Click Storage.
              3. Click Update next to a storage plugin.
              4. Copy the configuration to a text file, and save the file.
              5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each storage plugin
                 configuration that you want to save.

   Verify system option settings
          Drill should save set system options when you migrate Drill.
          However, you may want to verify which system options were
          changed from the default settings beforehand. You can run the
          following query to see which system options were changed from
          the defaults:

select * from sys.options where status = 'CHANGED';

          Example:

select * from sys.options where status = 'CHANGED';
+-------------------------------------+----------+---------+----------+---------
-+-------------+-----------+------------+
|                name                 |   kind   |  type   |  status  | num_val
 | string_val  | bool_val  | float_val  |
+-------------------------------------+----------+---------+----------+---------
-+-------------+-----------+------------+
| exec.errors.verbose                 | BOOLEAN  | SYSTEM  | CHANGED  | null
 | null        | true      | null       |
| new_view_default_permissions        | STRING   | SYSTEM  | CHANGED  | null
 | 777         | null      | null       |
| planner.enable_decimal_data_type    | BOOLEAN  | SYSTEM  | CHANGED  | null
 | null        | true      | null       |
| planner.enable_limit0_optimization  | BOOLEAN  | SYSTEM  | CHANGED  | null
 | null        | true      | null       |
+-------------------------------------+----------+---------+----------+---------
-+-------------+-----------+------------+
4 rows selected (0.541 seconds)

          After you migrate, run the query again to verify that the system
          options are still set. If not, set the options.

   Shutdown the Drill cluster
          Issue the following command to shutdown the existing
          Warden-managed Drill cluster:

maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action stop -nodes <node host names sepa
rated by a space>

          Note: Do not shutdown nodes when queries are in progress.

   Verify that Drillbits stopped
          Run the following command to verify that the Drillbit service is
          no longer running on each node:

ps -ef | grep -i drill

          No Drill processes should print to screen when you run this
          command.

          You can also log in to the MCS at https://<host name>:8443 to
          verify the status of the Drillbit service. You should not see
          Drillbit as a listed service.

   Uninstall Drill
          Uninstall Drill and then run configure.sh -R to refresh the
          configuration.
          Issue the command appropriate for your system as root or using
          sudo to uninstall the mapr-drill package:

          Operating System          Command
          RedHat/CentOS    yum remove mapr-drill
          Ubuntu           apt-get remove mapr-drill

          Note: Verify that Drillbit processes stopped.
