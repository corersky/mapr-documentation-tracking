Non-Hashed and Hashed Indexes

   You can create non-hashed and hashed indexes for queries on JSON tables
   in MapR-DB.

   Non-hashed indexes support conditional queries with an ORDER BY clause
   because MapR-DB sorts the data in non-hashed indexes. When processing
   ORDER BY queries, Drill does not have to perform sort operations on the
   data.

   Hashed indexes support the same conditional queries as non-hashed
   indexes, but they do not have a guaranteed sort order. Hashed indexes
   enable MapR-DB to evenly distribute new writes on an index across
   logical partitions to avoid hot spotting. Drill must perform a sort for
   ORDER BY queries that use hashed indexes. Sorting the data can increase
   the CPU costs and negatively impact performance. See [1]Hashed Indexes
   for additional information.

   If you notice performance issues with ORDER BY queries that use hashed
   indexes, review the query plans to see if the plans include sort and
   merge operations. If this is the case, create non-hashed indexes to
   support the queries and achieve the best performance.

Examples of Hashed and Non-Hashed Index Plans for an ORDER BY Query

   The examples here show the difference between a hashed and non-hashed
   index plan for the following query on the lineitem table that contains
   the [2]ORDER BY clause:
SELECT L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHERE L_LINENUMBER = 1 AND L_ORDER
KEY BETWEEN 40 AND 75 ORDER BY L_LINENUMBER;

   Hashed Index Plan Example
   A hashed index, l_hash_comp_1, was created using the maprcli table
   index add command on a table, lineitem, as shown:
maprcli table index add -path /drill/testdata/tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/hash/lineitem
 -index l_hash_comp_1 -indexedfields L_LINENUMBER,L_ORDERKEY -includedfields L_L
INESTATUS,L_QUANTITY -hashed true

   Running the example query with the [3]EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command shows
   that Drill produces an index plan with sort and merge operations to
   process the query when using the hashed index, as follows:
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHERE L_LINENUMBE
R = 1 AND L_ORDERKEY BETWEEN 40 AND 75 ORDER BY L_LINENUMBER;

00-00    Screen
00-01      Project(L_LINESTATUS=[$0], L_QUANTITY=[$1])
00-02        SingleMergeExchange(sort0=[2])
01-01          SelectionVectorRemover
01-02            Sort(sort0=[$2], dir0=[ASC])
01-03              Project(L_LINESTATUS=[$2], L_QUANTITY=[$3], L_LINENUMBER=[$0]
)
01-04                Scan(table=[[si, tpch_sf1_maprdb_hash, lineitem]], groupsca
n=[JsonTableGroupScan [ScanSpec=JsonScanSpec [tableName=maprfs:///drill/testdata
/tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/hash/lineitem, condition=(((L_LINENUMBER = {"$numberLong":
1}) and (L_ORDERKEY >= {"$numberLong":40})) and (L_ORDERKEY <= {"$numberLong":75
})), indexName=l_hash_comp_1], columns=[`L_LINENUMBER`, `L_ORDERKEY`, `L_LINESTA
TUS`, `L_QUANTITY`]]])

   Reading the query plan, you can see that Drill uses the hashed index in
   the plan, as indicated by indexName=l_hash_comp_1. To process the
   query, MapR-DB can use the index, but Drill must sort and merge the
   data, as indicated by the Sort and SingleMergeExchange operations in
   the query plan.

   Using the hashed index plan for this ORDER BY query requires additional
   processing and negatively impacts performance.

   Non-Hashed Index Plan Example
   A non-hashed index, l_comp_1, was created using the maprcli table index
   add command on a table, lineitem, as shown:
maprcli table index add -path /drill/testdata/tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/range/lineite
m -index l_comp_1 -indexedfields L_LINENUMBER,L_ORDERKEY -includedfields L_LINES
TATUS,L_QUANTITY

   Running the example query with the [4]EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command shows
   that Drill produces an index plan without the additional sort and merge
   operations when using the non-hashed index to process the query, as
   follows:
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHERE L_LINENUMBE
R = 1 AND L_ORDERKEY BETWEEN 40 AND 75 ORDER BY L_LINENUMBER;

00-00    Screen
00-01      Project(L_LINESTATUS=[$0], L_QUANTITY=[$1])
00-02        Project(L_LINESTATUS=[$2], L_QUANTITY=[$3], L_LINENUMBER=[$0])
00-03          Scan(table=[[si, tpch_sf1_maprdb_range, lineitem]], groupscan=[Js
onTableGroupScan [ScanSpec=JsonScanSpec [tableName=maprfs:///drill/testdata/tpch
/sf1/maprdb/json/range/lineitem, condition=(((L_LINENUMBER = {"$numberLong":1})
and (L_ORDERKEY >= {"$numberLong":40})) and (L_ORDERKEY <= {"$numberLong":75})),
 indexName=l_comp_1], columns=[`L_LINENUMBER`, `L_ORDERKEY`, `L_LINESTATUS`, `L_
QUANTITY`]]])

   Reading the query plan, you can see that Drill uses the non-hashed
   index plan, as indicated by indexName=l_comp_1. To process the query,
   MapR-DB uses the index and Drill does not have to perform sort and
   merge operations on the data, as indicated by the absence of the Sort
   and SingleMergeExchange operations in the query plan. MapR-DB sorted
   the data in the index when the index was created.
