ODBC Connection Parameters

   Use the SSL ODBC connection parameters to configure a connection to
   Drill through an ODBC tool.
   The following table lists the ODBC connection parameters:
   Note: The Drill ODBC driver does not support password protected PEM/CRT
   files or multiple CRT certificates in a single PEM/CRT file. For
   additional instructions, see the [1]Drill ODBC Driver documentation.
   Name Value Required Description
   SSL Clear (0) No.

   This option specifies whether the cliet uses an SSL encrypted
   connection to communicate with Drill.
     * Enabled(1):The client communicates with Drill using SSL.
     * Disabled(0):SS Lis disabled.

   SSL is configured independently of authentication.

   When authentication and SSL are both enabled, the driver performs the
   specified authentication method over an SSL connection.
   TLSProtocol

   Empty, which defaults to

   tlsv12.
   No

   This property specifies the TLS protocol version used.

   Accepted values are:
     * tlsv1
     * tlsv11
     * tlsv12

   TrustedCerts

   The cacerts.pem file in the \lib subfolder within the Driver's
   installation directory. The exact file path varies depending on the
   version of the driver that is installed.

   For example, the path for the Windows driver is different from the path
   for the Mac OS driver.
   No

   The full path of the PEM file containing Trusted CA certificates, for
   verifying the server. If this option is not set, then the driver
   defaults to using the trusted CA certificates PEM file installed by the
   driver.
   UseSystemTrustStore

   Clear (0)
   No

   This option specifies whether to use a CA certificate from the system
   truststore, or from a specified PEM file.
     * Enabled (1): The driver verifies the connection using a certificate
       in the system truststore
     * Disabled (0): The driver verifies the connection using a specified
       PEM file.

   Note: This option is only available on Windows. If using this option,
   import the certificate into the "Trusted Root Certificate Authorities‚Äù
   certificate store.
   DisableCertificateVerification 0 No

   This property specifies that the driver verifies the host certificate
   against the truststore. Accepted values are:
     * 0: The driver verifies the certificate against the truststore.
     * 1: The driver does not verify the certificate against the
       truststore.

   DisableHostVerification 0 No

   This property specifies if the driver verifies that the host in the
   certificate is the host being connected to. Accepted values are:
     * 0: The driver verifies the certificate against the host being
       connected to.
     * 1: The driver does not verify the certificate against the host.
