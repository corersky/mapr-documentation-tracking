Drill JDBC Driver

   MapR provides a [1]Drill JDBC driver that you can use on all platforms
   to connect BI tools, such as SQuirreL and Spotfire, to Drill. The Drill
   JDBC driver provides read-only access to Drill data sources and
   supports the security features described in [2]Securing Drill.
   You can download and use the [3]Drill JDBC driver provided by MapR
   (recommended) or use the [4]open-source JDBC driver embedded in Drill.
   After you install Drill from the mapr-drill package, you can locate the
   open-source JDBC driver files in the following directories:
     * $DRILL_HOME/jars/jdbc-driver/drill-jdbc-all-1.11.0.jar
     * $DRILL_HOME/jars/drill-jdbc-1.11.0.jar

   Note: The open-source JDBC driver is not tested on the MapR Converged
   Data Platform. The driver supports Kerberos and Plain authentication
   mechanisms, but does not support the MapR-SASL authentication
   mechanism.

Drill JDBC Driver Download and Instructions

   You can download the latest Drill JDBC driver provided by MapR [5]here.
   The documentation for the Drill JDBC 1.5.6 driver is available at .
   Note: The Registering the Driver Class section of the driver
   documentation incorrectly lists the driver classes for MapR as
   com.simba.drill.jdbc41.Driver and com.simba.drill.jdbc41.DataSource.
   The correct driver classes for MapR are:
     * com.mapr.drill.jdbc41.Driver
     * com.mapr.drill.jdbc41.DataSource

   Note: The following information is not included in the documentation
   for the Drill JDBC driver:
     * You can indicate the schema parameter in the connection string, as
       shown in the following example:
jdbc:drill:zk=10.10.100.30:5181,10.10.100.31:5181,10.10.100.32:5181/drill/drillb
its1;schema=hive
     * If using the MapR-SASL or Plain authentication mechanism, you must
       add the Drill JDBC JAR files and /opt/mapr/lib/* to the classpath
       of the third-party client tool, as shown in the following example
       for SQuirreL when the path to the driver is
       C:\driver\MapRDrillJDBC41-1.5.6.1012:
-cp "%SQUIRREL_CP%;C:\driver\MapRDrillJDBC41-1.5.6.1012\*;C:\opt\mapr\lib\*"
       The driver JAR files should appear before /opt/mapr/lib/* in the
       classpath.
     * If you plan to use MapR-SASL for authentication on Windows, a MapR
       user ticket is required. See the Using MapR-SASL for Authentication
       on Windows section below for instructions.

Using MapR-SASL for Authentication on Windows

   Drill is automatically configured with [6]MapR security when you
   install Drill 1.11 and later on a MapR 6.0 cluster configured with
   default security. To successfully connect to Drill from a Windows JDBC
   client, a MapR user ticket must exist on the Windows client in the
   %TEMP% directory or in the location specified by the
   $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable.

   The JDBC driver locates user tickets for the current Windows user in
   the default ticket location, %TEMP%, or in the location specified by
   the environment variable, $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION. See [7]Tickets and
   [8]Generating a MapR User Ticket for more information.
   You can either copy a user ticket that was generated on the MapR
   cluster into the default location (%TEMP%), or you can install the MapR
   client on the Windows client and then run the [9]maprlogin command to
   generate the ticket on the Windows client.
   Note: The JDBC user must be the same as the Windows user that created
   the ticket.

   Example
   If you want to connect to Drill as the mapr user, you must create a
   ticket for the mapr user, as shown:
$ maprlogin password -user mapr
[Password for user 'mapr' at cluster 'Cluster1':]

   The MapR credentials for the mapr user in Cluster1 are written to
   /tmp/maprticket_1000.
   Next, place the ticket in the %TEMP% directory on the Windows client.
   For example, the default location for a Windows 10 user named Tabetha
   Stephens is shown:
'C:\Users\TABETH~1\AppData\Local\Temp/maprticket_Tabetha Stephens'

   To override this location, set the "MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION" global
   variable for the Windows user.
   Note: Using the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION is recommended because the
   %TEMP% directory differs between Windows versions. You may also want to
   set the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION per user on the operating system to
   prevent all users from using the same user ticket on the client.

Avoiding Driver Conflicts

   If you download and use the Drill JDBC driver provided by MapR, rename
   the embedded JDBC driver files to avoid any conflict between the
   downloaded driver and the open-source driver. The embedded JDBC driver
   files are in the following directories after you install Drill:
$DRILL_HOME/jars/jdbc-driver/drill-jdbc-all-1.10.0.jar
$DRILL_HOME/jars/drill-jdbc-1.10.0.jar

   Changing the file extension to rename these files, as shown in the
   following example, prevents Drill or any other application, such as
   SQLLine, from picking up the embedded driver:
$DRILL_HOME/jars/jdbc-driver/drill-jdbc-all-1.10.0.jar.original
$DRILL_HOME/jars/drill-jdbc-1.10.0.jar.original
