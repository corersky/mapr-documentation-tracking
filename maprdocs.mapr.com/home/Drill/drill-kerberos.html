Kerberos

   Drill on MapR supports Kerberos v5 network security authentication and
   encryption. Kerberos is a network authentication protocol built on
   symmetric-key cryptography. Kerberos eliminates the need to store
   passwords locally or send them over the network and reduces the risk of
   impersonation.

   Kerberos provides a security infrastructure called a Kerberos Realm. A
   Kerberos Realm is comprised of clients, services or hosts, and a KDC
   (key-distribution center). The KDC is a trusted third-party service
   that generates tickets to coordinate authentication between a client
   and server or host. Tickets are cached on the client machine, which
   allows for single sign-on.

   Clients use a password or a special file called a “keytab” to get
   tickets from the KDC. Clients exchange the tickets and secret keys with
   the KDC and service or host to prove their identity for access to the
   requested service. This authentication process of exchanging tickets
   and secret keys runs in the background, unseen by the user trying to
   access the service. When a client request to access a service is
   granted, a unique session key is established between the client and
   service. The unique session key proves the authenticity of the user.
   The session key is used for all communication between the client and
   service. Kerberos also supports encryption between the client and
   server to prevent data theft from a man-in-the-middle attack during
   communication.
   A KDC administrator must create the password or keytab for the clients
   and servers, as well as a principal (a name for the user or server
   identity) to securely authenticate using the Kerberos infrastructure.
   Note: Proper setup, configuration, administration, and usage of a
   Kerberos environment is beyond the scope of this documentation. See the
   [1]MIT Kerberos documentation for more detailed information about
   Kerberos.

   The following sections list the prerequisites for using Kerberos with
   Drill and describe the authentication process.

Prerequisites

     * The [2]MapR Drill driver includes the required Kerberos plugin to
       authenticate to secure Kerberos Drill clusters. To use Kerberos
       with Drill, you must have a working Kerberos infrastructure, which
       Drill does not provide.
     * Either a ticket granting ticket (TGT) is pre-generated on the
       client node, or a keytab file and the client principal is available
       to provide in the connection URL for Kerberos authentication
       between the Drill client and Drill server. Drill does not generate
       the TGT.
     * You must be working in a Linux-based or Windows Active Directory
       (AD) Kerberos environment with secure clusters and have a Drill
       server configured for Kerberos.

Client Authentication Process

   This section provides a high-level overview of the Kerberos client
   authentication process. For this overview, assume that Kerberos
   credentials are present in the client.

   The following diagram shows the process of authenticating a client:
   [kerberos-auth-process.png]
    1. The client sends a request for a ticket granting ticket that
       contains the user principal to the Kerberos KDC, a network service
       that supplies tickets and temporary session keys.
    2. The authentication server validates the principal’s identity and
       sends the client a ticket granting ticket and session key encrypted
       with a secret key. A session key is a temporary encryption key used
       for one login session.
    3. Using the ticket granting ticket, the principal requests access to
       a Drillbit service from the ticket granting server.
    4. The ticket granting server checks for a valid ticket granting
       ticket and the principal identity. If the request is valid, the
       ticket granting server returns a ticket granting service ticket.
    5. The client uses the service ticket to request access to the
       Drillbit.
    6. The Drillbit service has access to the keytab, a file that contains
       a list of keys for principals. The key allows the service to
       decrypt the client’s ticket granting service ticket, identify the
       principal, and grant access.

Server Authentication Process

   For Kerberos server authentication information, see the [3]MIT Kerberos
   administration documentation.
