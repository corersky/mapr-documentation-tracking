Plain Authentication

   An administrator can configure Drill to use the Linux pluggable
   authentication module (PAM) for Plain (username and password)
   authentication. PAM provides an authentication module that interfaces
   with any installed PAM authentication entity, such as the local
   operating system password file (/etc/passwd) or LDAP.
   Note: As of Drill 1.13 and MapR 6.0.1 ([1]MEP 5.0), Drill supports
   form-based authentication between the web client and Drillbit.
   Form-based authentication is like Plain authentication in that a user
   is presented with a web form where s/he enters a username and password
   to access restricted web pages. [2]Configuring Drill to Use libpam4j
   includes configuration details. When using form-based authentication,
   you can also configure Drill to use SPNEGO. See [3]SPNEGO for HTTP
   Authentication.

   When using PAM for authentication, each user with permission to run
   Drill queries must exist in the list of users that resides on each
   Drill node in the cluster. The username (including uid) and password
   for each user must be identical across all Drill nodes.
   If you use PAM with /etc/passwd for authentication, verify that the
   users permitted to start the Drill process are part of the shadow user
   group on all nodes in the cluster. This enables Drill to read the
   /etc/shadow file for authentication.
   Note: Plain authentication does not support SASL encryption. You can
   use [4]SSL/TLS for encryption when Plain authentication is enabled. You
   can also enable [5]user impersonation and create views to limit user
   access to data.

Authentication Process Overview

   During the authentication process, the client passes a username and
   password to the Drillbit as part of the connection request, which then
   passes the credentials to PAM. If PAM authenticates the user, the
   connection request passes the authentication phase, and the connection
   is established. The user will be authorized to access Drill and issue
   queries against the file system or other storage plugins, such as Hive.
   The following image illustrates the PAM user authentication process in
   Drill:

   If PAM cannot authenticate the user, the connection request does not
   pass the authentication phase and the user will not be authorized to
   access Drill. The connection is terminated as AUTH_FAILED.

   For more PAM information (including a JPAM User Guide), see [6]JPAM.

Configuring Plain Authentication in Drill

   Drill supports the libjpam and libpam4j libraries. In Drill 1.12 and
   later, the libpam4j library is packaged with Drill. There is no
   download or external dependency required to use libpam4j. Using
   libpam4j is recommended for Drill 1.12 and later.
   Note: You can configure Drill to use multiple types of authenication
   mechanisms. For example, you can configure Drill to use Plain,
   Kerberos, and MapR-SASL; however, only [7]SSL/TLS is supported for
   encryption when Plain authentication is configured with other
   authentication mechanisms.

   The following sections provide information for configuring Drill to use
   libpam4j or libjpam, as well as instructions for connecting to Drill
   from SQLLine and BI tools when Plain authentication is enabled:
