Using ACEs on Views to Limit Data Access

   [1]Drill is a distributed SQL query layer that runs on the MapR
   platform. You can enable [2]user impersonation and [3]create views in
   Drill to control user access to data stored in the MapR platform at the
   row and column levels. Access to data is based on file permissions set
   on the data (source files) and on the view definition files.

   In addition to standard POSIX permissions, MapR supports [4]ACEs
   (access control expressions) to secure data in the distributed file
   system. ACEs are a flexible access control mechanism that applies to
   files, MapR tables, and MapR streams. [5]Setting an ACE (access control
   expression) on a file modifies the file permission to honor the ACE
   setting. Drill honors ACEs set on Drill view files and on the source
   files that views access.

   Each[6] Drill view created has an associated view definition file, with
   a .view.drill extension, on which you can set ACEs to secure the view.

Example

   Frank creates a [7]workspace in the [8]dfs storage plugin configuration
   in Drill that points to his home directory in the distributed file
   system. He then uses Drill to create a table named “employees” that he
   and the HR group can access:
-rwxr----- frank:hr /user/frank/employees

   Joe, a member of the HR and MGR groups, creates a view named
   emp_mgr_view in his home directory to share a subset of the employees
   data with managers that belong to the MGR group:
-rwxr----- joe:mgr /user/joe/emp_mgr_view.drill.view

   Managers in the MGR group have read permission on the
   emp_mgr_view.drill.view file so they can query the emp_mgr_view that
   Joe created and they can create new views from his view.

   Setting ACEs on the underlying data source (the “employees” table) or
   on the view file (emp_mgr_view.drill.view) that accesses the underlying
   data source resets the POSIX mode bits to match the permissions granted
   through ACE settings.
   For example, if Frank issues the following command to apply an ACE to
   the “employees” table, a user must be a member of the EXEC group to
   read data in the “employees” table:
hadoop mfs -setace -R -readfile 'g:exec' employees

   Anyone in the HR group that previously had access to the table can no
   longer access the table data unless they also belong to the EXEC group.
   Running the –getace command on the table lists the ACE settings on the
   table:
hadoop mfs -getace /user/frank/employees
Path: /user/frank/employees
 readfile: g:exec
 writefile:
 executefile:
 readdir:
 addchild:
 deletechild:
 lookupdir:
 inherit: true
 mode: ---------

   Similarly, if Joe issues the following command on the on the
   emp_mgr_view.drill.view file, only members of the HR group can read the
   file. Users that belong to the MGR group can no longer access the data
   through the view, unless they also belong to the HR group.
hadoop mfs -setace -R -readfile 'g:hr' emp_mgr_view.drill.view

   Running the –getace command on view file shows the ACE settings on the
   file:
hadoop mfs -getace /user/joe/emp_mgr_view.drill.view
Path: /user/joe/emp_mgr_view.drill.view
 readfile: g:hr
 writefile:
  executefile:
  readdir:
  addchild:
  deletechild:
  lookupdir:
  inherit: true
  mode: ---------
