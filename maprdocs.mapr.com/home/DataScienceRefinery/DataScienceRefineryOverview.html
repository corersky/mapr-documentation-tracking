MapR Data Science Refinery

   The MapR Data Science Refinery is an easy-to-deploy and scalable data
   science toolkit with native access to all platform assets and superior
   out-of-the-box security.

   The MapR Data Science Refinery offers:

   Access to All Platform Assets
          The MapR FUSE-based POSIX Client allows app servers, web
          servers, and other client nodes and apps to read and write data
          directly and securely to a MapR cluster, like a Linux
          filesystem. In addition, connectors are provided for interacting
          with both MapR-DB and MapR-ES via Apache Spark connectors.

   Superior Security
          The MapR Platform provides enhanced security. Apache Zeppelin on
          MapR leverages and integrates with this security layer using the
          built-in capabilities provided by the [1]MapR Persistent
          Application Container (PACC).

   Extensibility
          Apache Zeppelin is paired with the Helium framework to offer
          pluggable visualization capabilities.

   Simplified Deployment
          A preconfigured Zeppelin Docker container provides the ability
          to leverage MapR as a persistent data store.

Getting Started Using the Data Science Refinery with Zeppelin

   There are multiple ways to deploy the Apache Zeppelin Docker container
   included in the Data Science Refinery as shown in the following
   diagram:

   Note: Starting in version 1.2, you can deploy the Data Science Refinery
   on a MapR cluster node. Make sure you take into consideration the
   resource requirements of the Data Science Refinery, if you choose this
   deployment mode.

   If you are already familiar with Apache Zeppelin on MapR and want to
   skip to the deployment instructions, see [2]Running the Zeppelin
   Container.
