Installation and Upgrade Notes (MapR 6.0.1)

   This page describes considerations for upgrading to Map 6.0.1.

   If you are upgrading from MapR 4.x or 5.x, be sure to review
   [1]Installation and Upgrade Notes (MapR 6.0.0) first.

Upgrading to MapR 6.0.1 Using the MapR Installer

   Note these considerations for upgrading to MapR 6.0.1 [2]using the MapR
   Installer:
   MapR Installer 1.9.0 Before upgrading, [3]update the MapR Installer to
   version 1.9.0 or later. Only MapR Installer 1.9.0 or later can be used
   with MapR 6.0.1 and MEP 5.0.0.
   MapR 6.0.1 and MEP 5.0.0 MapR 6.0.1 requires MEP 5.0.0. MEP 4.x can
   coexist with MapR 6.0.1 only temporarily in the context of an upgrade.
   Version Upgrade Upgrading to MapR 6.0.1 using the MapR Installer
   requires you to perform a [4]version upgrade. Even if the cluster to be
   upgraded is running MapR 6.0.0, you cannot complete the upgrade by
   doing a maintenance update. A maintenance update assumes that the MEP
   version will not change, but upgrading from MapR 6.0.0 to MapR 6.0.1
   requires upgrading the MEP version from 4.x to 5.0.0 or later.
   Changes to Auto-Provisioning Templates MapR 6.0.1 introduces new and
   changed auto-provisioning templates. See the Installer 1.9 information
   in [5]Auto-Provisioning Templates.
   Renamed Services The following services are renamed in MapR Installer
   1.9.0:

   Old Name → New Name

   OJAI Query Service → OJAI Distributed Query Service

   HBase/MapR-DB Common → MapR DataBase
   Enhanced Security for Passwords To support enhanced security, the MapR
   Installer:
     * Implements password verification for every password entered.
     * Requests password information for certain MapR Monitoring
       components if the security mode requires passwords. For more
       information, see the MapR Installer operational changes in
       [6]Operational Changes (MapR 6.0.1).

   MapR DataBase Service and Gateways Installing the MapR DataBase service
   automatically triggers installation of the gateway package, the MapR
   Data Access Gateway, and some streams components, depending on the
   auto-provisioning template you choose.
   Querying Using Secondary Indexes New options are available for
   configuring the cluster to query secondary indexes. See [7]Preparing
   Clusters for Querying using Secondary Indexes on JSON Tables.

Upgrading to MapR 6.0.1 Manually

   Note these considerations for upgrading to MapR 6.0.1 using [8]manual
   steps:
   MapR 6.0.1 and MEP 5.0.0 MapR 6.0.1 requires MEP 5.0.0. MEP 4.x can
   coexist with MapR 6.0.1 only temporarily in the context of an upgrade.
   Querying Using Secondary Indexes New options are available for
   configuring the cluster to query secondary indexes. See [9]Preparing
   Clusters for Querying using Secondary Indexes on JSON Tables.
   MapR DataBase Service and Gateways If you install the mapr-hbase-common
   package, consider installing these additional packages that are
   installed automatically when mapr-hbase-common is installed by the MapR
   Installer:
     * mapr-data-access-gateway
     * mapr-gateway

   Installing Metrics and Logging Components The manual steps for
   installing MapR Monitoring metrics and logging components now include
   steps for specifying passwords for Grafana and Elasticsearch:
     * [10]Step 8: Install Metrics Monitoring
     * [11]Step 9: Install Log Monitoring
