Installation and Upgrade Notes (MapR 6.0.0)

   Read these notes before installing or upgrading to MapR 6.0 or later.

Installing Using the MapR Installer

   You can use the MapR installer to install a new cluster or upgrade a
   currently installed (nonsecure) cluster to MapR 6.0 or later. When you
   use the MapR Installer for a new installation, security is enabled by
   default. To understand what this means, see [1]Built-in Security in
   MapR.

   If you do not want to install a secure cluster, you must deselect the
   Enable MapR Secure Cluster option. See [2]Using the Enable MapR Secure
   Cluster Option.

Installing Without Using the MapR Installer

   You can install the cluster manually and configure security in the
   process. See [3]Installing without the MapR Installer.

Upgrading to MapR 6.0 or Later

   Before upgrading to MapR 6.0 or later, review these notes and
   restrictions. For more information, see [4]Planning the MapR Core
   Upgrade:
   Offline Upgrades [5]Offline upgrades to MapR 6.0 or later are supported
   for clusters running these MapR releases:
     * 3.x
     * 4.0.x
     * 4.1
     * 5.x

   YARN Requirement The cluster to be upgraded must be converted to YARN
   before the upgrade.
   Unsupported Ecosystem Components The following ecosystem components
   were supported on pre-6.0 clusters but are not supported on MapR 6.0 or
   later. Before the upgrade, applications that use these components
   should be disabled, and the packages should be removed:
     * Apache HBase server components (HBase master and regionserver)
     * Apache Mahout
     * Apache Storm

   Upgrading and Security Upgrades using the MapR Installer or Stanzas are
   supported only for clusters running MapR 5.2.x with MEP 3.0.1 or later.
   However, if the cluster is configured for security – either the default
   MapR security or custom security settings – upgrading with the MapR
   Installer or Stanzas is not supported. You must upgrade manually.

   Security is not enabled by default during upgrades. A nonsecure cluster
   that is upgraded will remain a nonsecure cluster. If you have tailored
   security on your cluster before upgrading, you must upgrade manually,
   but your security settings will be preserved through the upgrade.
   Rolling Upgrades [6]Rolling upgrades are subject to these restrictions:
     * Rolling upgrades are supported only for clusters running MapR 5.2.x
       with MEP 3.0.1 or later.
     * Not all ecosystem components support rolling upgrades.
     * Scripted rolling upgrades are not supported.

   MEP 3.0.x and MapR 6.0 or Later MEP 3.0.x is supported on MapR 6.0 or
   later only for upgrade purposes. After upgrading to MapR 6.0 or later,
   you must upgrade MEP 3.0.x to MEP 4.0 or later. Upgrading to MEP 4.0 or
   later must be done before enabling the new features in MapR 6.0 or
   later.
   MapR Monitoring and MapR 6.0 or Later To enable certain features in the
   new MapR Control System, you must install the collectd and OpenTSDB
   components of MapR Monitoring for MapR 6.0 or later.
   MapR-DB JSON Tables with insertionorder Option The insertionorder
   option for MapR-DB JSON tables is not supported as of MapR 6.0. When
   upgrading from MapR 5.x, all existing MapR-DB JSON tables with
   insertionorder option set to true will show a new behavior where
   insertionorder is set to false.

MapR Client Compatibility

   In general, MapR 4.x and 5.x clients will continue to work with a
   cluster that is upgraded to MapR 6.0 or later.

MapR Interoperability Matrix

   See the [7]Interoperability Matrix pages for detailed information about
   MapR server, JDK, client, and ecosystem compatibility.
