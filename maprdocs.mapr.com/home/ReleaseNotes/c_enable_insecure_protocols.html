Requirement to Enable Insecure Protocols

   MapR disables insecure protocols by default. For example, TLSv1 and
   SSLv3 are disabled by default due to their associated security risks.
   In the event that your client environment or crypto libraries cannot be
   upgraded, you can decide to enable insecure protocols.
   Note: Enabling insecure protocols is not recommended as the security of
   communications between the browser and web server is put at risk.
   To enable insecure protocols:
    1. Based on your requirements, add one of the following configurations
       to the core-site.xml file on each node with a service that runs a
       web server:
          + To enable SSLv3:
<property>
 <name>hadoop.ssl.exclude.insecure.protocols</name>
 <value>SSLV3</value>
</property>
          + To enable TLSv1:
<property>
 <name>hadoop.ssl.exclude.insecure.protocols</name>
 <value>TLSV1</value>
</property>
          + To enable all insecure protocols that MapR disables by
            default:
<property>
 <name>hadoop.ssl.exclude.insecure.protocols</name>
 <value></value>
</property
       The core-site.xml is in the following location:
       /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/etc/hadoop/
    2. Restart services associated with web servers.
       Examples:
          + To restart the MCS webserver:
   maprcli node services -webserver restart -nodes <webserver nodes>
          + To restart the ResourceManager service(s):
maprcli node services -name resourcemanager -action restart -nodes <space delimi
ted list of resourcemanager nodes>
