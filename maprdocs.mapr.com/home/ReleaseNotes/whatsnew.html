What's New in Version 6.0.0

   The 6.0.0 MapR release supplies new features for all of the components
   of the converged data platform as well as expanding the MapR Monitoring
   tool. In addition, installing the MapR converged data platform has been
   simplified.

Powerful Data Access on MapR-DB with Native Secondary Indexes.

   MapR-DB has new capabilities and performance improvements in this
   release. You can use the MapR-DB JSON document database to enable
   powerful data access for either operational or analytics applications.
   You can develop new types of applications that support complex
   user-interaction patterns. If you are a business user, you can perform
   optimized and high-performance SQL queries using familiar business
   intelligence and anlytics tools.

   See this page to start using [1]Secondary Indexes

   Here is a summary of the key features added to MapR-DB for this
   release.

   Native Secondary indexes support for MapR-DB JSON tables.
     * Secondary-index support is built into MapR-DB. No external indexing
       system necessary. An administrator, or someone with administrator
       priviledges, can create one or more indexes on each JSON table with
       a unique field. Once created, you can leverage indexes via OJAI
       APIs for application development or via Drill for BI/Analytics
       purposes to improve query performance.
          + Support for single field and composite indexes
          + Support for covering, non-covering and hashed indexes
          + Standard data types support for secondary indexes. This
            includes NULL, BOOLEAN,STRING, BYTE, SHORT,INT,LONG,
            FLOAT,DOUBLE, DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, BINARY
          + Applicability of all enterprise capabilities of MapR such as
            HA, Snapshots, Security to secondary indexes.
          + Global and Automatic index synchronization without application
            developer intervention and/or additional coding
     * Application-level consistency via "Read Your Own Write" support
       allows your application to see the change it makes immediately
       after taking effect on the index table
     * OJAI API and MapR Drill/SQL integrations that leverage indexes to
       increase query performanc

   Self Service Operational Analytics with Optimized MapR Drill and SQL
   Integration with MapR-DB
     * MapR Drill SQL queries will seamlessly leverage MapR-DB secondary
       indexes to signicantly improve query performance.
     * MapR Drill SQL queries will avoid large scans when they are
       unnecessary.
     * MapR-DB provides a statistics and cost-based optimizer for index
       selection. It supports index intersection and a variety of other
       optimizations.
     * MapR-DB provides support for filter and sorting operators.

   Rich Application Development with Apache OJAI enhancements
     * New Sort and Limit operators are available in Apache OJAI APIs
     * Obtain high performance with Apache OJAI API-based queries by
       leveraging MapR-DB secondary indexes
     * MapR-DB provides index support for Filter and Sorting operators

Change Data Capture API on MapR-DB

   Built on the foundation of global-table-replication features, the
   MapR-DB Change Data Capture (CDC) API provides a powerful and
   easy-to-use interface to support real-time integration of changes
   arriving at a MapR-DB table to arbitrary, external systems. You can now
   build an application to consume and process the MapR-DB table data
   changes published as ‘change log’ streams in real time in a highly
   scalable way.

   See this page to get started using [2]Change Data Capture

   CDC enables you to accomplish work such as:
     * Track changes happening to the MapR-DB (Inserts, Updates, Deletes)
       and perform real time processing on the data
     * Synchronize data in MapR-DB with a downstream search index (Such as
       Elasticsearch, Solr), materialized views or in-memory caches.

   The CDC feature includes the following capabilities
     * You can use ordered and “At-least-once” delivery to send a change
       data record stream to each registered change log.
     * The publish/Subscribe model supports the pull model of
       change-data-propagation
     * An arbitrary external system can consume changes in MapR-DB tables
       globally
     * You can use CDC with both MapR-DB Binary and JSON tables.

Redesigned administration platform with expanded functionality for managing
and monitoring your data.

     * New Cluster Overview Dashboard - Get a single-pane-of-glass view of
       your cluster environment to determine cluster utilization, node and
       service health, events that need attention.
     * Enhanced Alarm Management - Handle alarms efficiently with new
       categorization, easy access to information, and selective
       notifications.
     * Intuitive, easy data administration that includes a new Streams
       administrative interface - Navigate and manage all of your volume,
       table, and stream data elements in a consistent way. Each now has a
       dedicated interface.
     * Integration with Spyglass - Analyze metrics and log information
       from Spyglass right within MCS.

Replica Autosetup with Directcopy

   The replica autosetup feature for tables and streams has a new, default
   directcopy option. Replica autosetup with directcopy uses gateways to
   perform all replication setup steps including the initial population of
   data into the replica table or replica stream.
   Replica autosetup with directcopy provides the following benefits:
     * Replica autosetup operations do not block the client from
       submitting additional requests. When setting up replication, the
       process to copy source data to the replica can be time consuming.
       With directcopy, the client does not need to wait for the replica
       autosetup request to complete before submitting another request.
     * Source cluster retries replica autosetup operations in case of
       failure. The source cluster keeps track of the replica autosetup
       progress. This allows the source cluster to resume autosetup
       operations in the event of an intermittent failure. If you choose
       to not use directcopy, user intervention is required if a failure
       occurs.
     * Throttling of copy table or copy stream operations is done by
       default. Throttling prevents the initial copy of data from the
       source to the replica table from consuming all cluster resources.

   Replica autosetup uses the directcopy option by default when you choose
   to automatically set up replication in the MCS and when you use the
   maprcli to automatically setup replication.

Security Enhancements

   Simplified Security. In MapR 6.0, it is easier to enable security. You
   can use the simple "Enable Security" check box in the installer to
   enable security for the core platform and the installed ecosystem
   components. Alternatively, you can use the configure.sh -secure command
   to enable security for the core and the ecosystem components.

   [5]Built-In Security

   Cross-Cluster Security Script. The configure-crosscluster.sh utility,
   which you can use to set up cross-cluster security between two
   clusters, has been enhanced to configure clusters for secure
   communication.

Global Cloud Data Fabric Enablement

   Cloud-Scale Multitenancy, OpenStack Manila Plugin, and File Migration
   Services are built into MapR Converged Data Platform 6.0.

   To support hosting multiple organizations on the same data platform
   while ensuring intra-organization privacy and intra-organization
   policies, you can use the multitenancy and OpenStack Manila features.

   [8]OpenStack Manila

   Real-time, automatic movement of all types of files from edge to cloud
   is available using the File Migration Service. The service deploys to
   each edge site, watches for new files, and immediately transfers them
   to the cloud. It's intelligent use of MapR metadata service ensures
   reliability and performance.

     * [10]Guaranteed minimum replication for IOs
     * [11]Audit all content in the volume
     * [12]Segregate NICs for internal and external clients
     * [13]Balance containers of a volume
     * [14]Enhancements to volume metrics

Enhancements to MapR-Drill

   There are multiple new features for MapR-Drill. See the [15]Drill
   release notes for details.

MapR Container for Developers

   The MapR Container for Developers is a Docker container that enables
   you to create a single node MapR 6.0 cluster. The container is
   lightweight and designed to run on your laptop. It requires no
   additional configuration for you to connect your clients, also running
   on your laptop, to the cluster. See [16]MapR Container for Developers.

New Terminology: MapR Expansion Pack

   MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) replaces all instances of MapR Ecosystem Pack
   (MEP) in MapR 5.2.x and 6.0 documentation. MEPs now contain more than
   just Hadoop Ecosystem components. They can contain connectors and
   developer APIs that provide common Hadoop Ecosystem interfaces (for
   example, Kafka Connect) to MapR components.

   Some MapR user interfaces continue to use the term MapR Ecosystem Pack.
   These interfaces will be updated eventually.
