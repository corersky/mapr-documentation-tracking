List of YARN Enhancements (MapR 6.0.0)

   MapR 6.0 runs the 2.7.0 version of Hadoop. A number of new features
   have been incorporated into the version of Hadoop that MapR Converged
   Data Platform 6.0 uses.
     * YARN by default now limits admin access to default queue. See
       [1]Queue Access Control Lists.
     * Yarn queue - status has been modified. Before this release, it did
       not show information about the queue labels because certain Apache
       properties for retrieving the information are not supported. With
       this release, the MapR "Label" and and "Label Policy" properties
       are provided as outputs to the Yarn queue - status command in lieu
       of the unsupported Apache properties. See [2]yarn queue
     * hadoop fs -ls enhancement. The performance of this command as been
       increased significantly.
     * Incorrect group ownership for container logs when CentralLogging is
       enabled. In 6.0, group ownership with CentralLogging behaves
       correctly.
     * Container allocation has been enhanced to prevent jobs failing
       under certain situations.
     * The YARN Timeline Server is available with Hive-on-Tez. See
       [3]Configuring the Timeline Server to Use the Hive-on-Tez User
       Interface
     * NodeManager Restart is enabled by default. See [4]Configuring
       NodeManager Restart
