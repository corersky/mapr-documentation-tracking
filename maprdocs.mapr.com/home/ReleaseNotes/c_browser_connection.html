Unable to Establish a Secure Connection

   This section describes secure connection issues.

   Recent versions of Safari and Chrome web browsers have removed support
   for older certificate cipher algorithms, including those used by some
   versions of MapR. Because of this, users of these new browser versions
   may lose the ability to log into MapR Control System (MCS).

   A fix for this issue is available in MapR Versions 4.0.2 and later.
   Existing clusters can be patched to workaround this issue. Information
   and installation instructions for this patch are found later in this
   document. For additional fixes that you may also want to apply at this
   time, see Web Browser Security Issues.

Affected Versions

   To determine whether you will be affected, your MapR version must be in
   the range listed in the MapR section below, and you must be accessing
   MCS using a browser version listed in either the Safari or Chrome
   sections.
     * MapR - Versions 3.1, 3.1.1, 4.0.0, and 4.0.1
     * Safari - Versions 7.0 and higher.
     * Chrome - Versions 39.0 and higher.

Symptoms

   Error message for Chrome:
          SSL connection error. Unable to make a secure connection to the server
.
          This maybe a problem with the server,
          or it may be requiring a client authentication certificate that you do
n't have.
          Error code: ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR

          because Safari can't establish a secure connection to the server <serv
er name>.

Patching your Cluster

   The steps to implement the fix for a secure cluster (cluster with
   wire-level security) differ from the steps to implement the fix on a
   non-secure cluster. However, in both cases, you will use the fixssl
   script to generate new versions of the ssl_keystore and ssl_truststore.

   While you are implementing the fix on a non-secure cluster, the
   webserver will experience a brief downtime. The impact on a secure
   cluster will be greater, as more services will need to be restarted for
   the patch to take effect. You have a secure cluster if you use
   wire-level security to encrypt data transmission between the nodes in
   your cluster.
