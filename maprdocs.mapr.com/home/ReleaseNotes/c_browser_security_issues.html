Web Browser Security Issues

   This section describes security issues with web browsers.

   Web browsers and web servers often need to update their security
   requirements and configurations to ensure secure communication.
   Sometimes when web browser security requirements change, the browser is
   no longer able to connect to the MCS or other web interfaces.

   The following fixes are available to resolve browser connection issues
   caused by changes in browser security requirements, or by an
   organization's need to maintain legacy (insecure) protocols:
                           Issue                            Affects MapR Version
 Weak Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Key                          3.x, 4.x, and 5.0
 Unable to Establish a Secure Connection                    3.1.x, 4.0.x
 Requirement to Enable Insecure Protocols (Not Recommended) 5.1
   Note: Based on your MapR version, you may need to apply the fix for
   more than one issue.
