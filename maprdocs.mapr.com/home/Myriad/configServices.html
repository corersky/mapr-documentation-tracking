Configuring Services

   Services, such as JobHistoryServer, can be launched as a task from the
   Myriad Framework.

   To configure services, define the service in the Myriad configuration
   file, myriad-config-default.yml. Once defined, the [1]Myriad Service
   REST API can be used to launch an instance as a task for the service.

   The services and service properties are as follows:
<!-- Define services as a task -->
services:
    serviceName:        # Name of the service
    jvmMaxMemoryMB:     # Memory needed for service
    cpus:               # CPU needed for Service
    ports:              # Map of ports: port property and value
                        # (Default: 0 which indicates that port will be assigned
 randomly)
                        # Uses the syntax, <name>: <value>
    envSettings:        # Any environment settings
    taskName:           # Again service name
    maxInstances:       # If defined maximum number of instances this service ca
n have per myriad framework
    command:            # Command to be executed
    serviceOptsName:    # Name of the env. variable that may need to be set for
the service that will include env. settings

   To configure additional services:
    1. Edit the myriad-config-default.yml file.
    2. For the services property, specify a service and provide the
       appropriate parameters.
       For example, to define a TimeLineServer task:
services:
    jobhistory:
        jvmMaxMemoryMB: 64
        cpus: 0.5
        ports:
           myriad.mapreduce.jobhistory.admin.address: 10033
           myriad.mapreduce.jobhistory.address: 10020
           myriad.mapreduce.jobhistory.webapp.address: 19888
        envSettings:
        taskName: jobhistory
        serviceOptsName: HADOOP_JOB_HISTORYSERVER_OPTS
        command: $YARN_HOME/bin/mapred historyserver
        maxInstances: 1
    timelineserver:
        jvmMaxMemoryMB: 1024
        cpus: 1
        ports:
            myriad.mapreduce.timeline.address: 10200
            myriad.mapreduce.timeline.webapp.address: 8188
        envSettings:
        taskName: timelineserver
        command: $YARN_HOME/bin/yarn timelineserver
        maxInstances: 1

    3. Copy or update the myriad-config-default.yml file on every node in
       the cluster.
    4. Restart the initial Resource Manager from Marathon.
