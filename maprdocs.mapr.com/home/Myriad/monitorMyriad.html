Monitoring Myriad

   Myriad is monitored via several application user interfaces.

   The following user interfaces are used to monitor application
   processes, tasks, configurations, and flexup or flexdow resources:
     * Marathon UI
     * Mesos UI
     * Myriad UI
     * MapR Control System (MCS)

Marathon UI

   The Marathon UI is used to manage application processes. The Apps panel
   provides created, suspended, scaled, and refreshed as well as restarted
   and destroyed. To view task details, click on the application link.
   The following screenshot shows the Marathon home page:

Mesos UI

   The Mesos UI is used to monitor Mesos active and completed tasks,
   provide cluster information, provide active and terminated frameworks,
   Mesos slave information, and Offers.

Myriad UI

   The Myriad UI is used to flexup or flexdown Node Manager instances,
   that is, to allocate more or less resource via a predefined
   configuration as well as to monitor your tasks and display Myriad
   configuration.
     * The main Myriad UI page show the underlying REST API.
     * The Flex button allows you to flex up or flex down instances by
       specifying the profile and number of instances to flex.
       Note: At this time, only one (1) instance is allowed.
     * The Task button shows the current active, killable, pending, and
       staging tasks.
     * The Config button shows the defined profiles and the parameters in
       the Myriad configuration file (myriad-config-default.yml).

   Flexing up and flexing down changes are reflected in the Mesos UI under
   the Myriad Framework name.

MapR Control System (MCS)

   The MapR Control System (MCS) is used as a central access point to
   navigate to Mesos Master, Mesos Slave, Mesos-DNS and Marathon
   information about the configured and running services in your cluster.

   installed and configured:
