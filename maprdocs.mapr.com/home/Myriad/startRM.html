Starting Resource Manager

   A Resource Manager for Myriad must be launched before the Myriad UI
   becomes available.
   The initial Resource Manager is started from Marathon. In addition,
   only one (1) Resource Manager can be launched on a cluster.
   Note: Starting the Resource Manager from the command line results in an
   error, see [1]Troubleshooting Myriad for a workaround.

   To start the Resource Manager:
    1. Launch Marathon with http://hostname:8080.
    2. Click on New App.
    3. Create a new application for the resource manager and specify:
          + ID - Default: rm
          + CPU - 0.2 minimum
          + Memory - 2048 minimum
          + Instances - 1 only
          + Command - env && yarn resourcemanager
       For example:

   CAPTION: Table 1. Application Parameters

       Parameter           Example
       ID        rm
       CPU       0.2
       Memory    2048
       Instances 1
       Command   env && yarn resourcemanager
       Important: Only one instance of Myriad Resource Manager can be
       running. Scaling up instances (specifying more than one instance)
       may result in unpredictable behavior. Creating a new Myriad
       application from Marathon results in a new framework.
    4. Access the Myriad UI with <hostname>:8192
       If you have multiple nodes in your cluster, Myriad may be started
       on any one of the nodes. To obtain the Myriad host, access the
       Mesos UI (http://<hostname>:5050) and check the Active Tasks >
       Hosts panel.
       If the Mesos-DNS entry is added on your local machine, the host can
       be accessed with the following address:
       http://rm.marathon.mesos:8192.
