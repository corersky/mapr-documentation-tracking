Use ORC Storage with Pig

   As of Pig 0.14, MapR supports the Hive ORC storage format for reading
   and writing data. This section presents simple examples of how to use
   ORC storage. For more details, see the [1]Pig documentation.

   ORC is typically used to read (load) and write (store) data as follows:
<VAR_NAME> = load '/path/to/orc/formatted/file' using OrcStorage();
store <VAR_NAME> into '/path/to/output/orc/file' using OrcStorage('');

   You use the grunt shell in Pig to execute these commands.
