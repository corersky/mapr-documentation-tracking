Configure Pig

   Pig runs in MapReduce mode by default. If you want to run Pig in local
   mode (pig -x local), add the following properties to the
   /opt/mapr/pig/pig-<version>/conf/pig.properties file:
fs.file.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.LocalFileSystem
io.file.buffer.size=4096

   The io.file.buffer.size property defines how much data is buffered
   during read and write operations; this value defaults to -1, causing
   Pig to fail when the local file system is used.
