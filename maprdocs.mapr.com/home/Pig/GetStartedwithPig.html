Get Started with Pig

   In this tutorial, we'll use Pig to run a MapReduce application that
   counts the words in the file /in/constitution.txt in the mapr user's
   directory on the cluster, and store the results in the file
   wordcount.txt.
    1. Download the ZIP file that contains [1]constitution.txt and then
       extract the constitution.txt file.
    2. Load the file onto the cluster and place it in the directory
       /user/mapr/in.
    3. In the terminal, type the command pig to start the Pig shell.
    4. At the grunt> prompt, type the following lines (press ENTER after
       each): After you type the last line, Pig starts a MapReduce
       application to count the words in the file constitution.txt.
A = LOAD '/user/mapr/in' USING TextLoader() AS (words:chararray);
B = FOREACH A GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE(*));
C = GROUP B BY $0;
D = FOREACH C GENERATE group, COUNT(B);
STORE D INTO '/user/mapr/wordcount';
    5. When the MapReduce application is complete, type quit to exit the
       Pig shell and take a look at the contents of the directory
       /myvolume/wordcount to see the results.
