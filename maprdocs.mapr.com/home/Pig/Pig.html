Pig

   [pig_logo.png]
   Apache Pigâ„¢ is a platform for analyzing large data sets. It consists of
   a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled
   with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. Pig's infrastructure
   layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of Map-Reduce
   programs. Pig's language layer currently consists of a textual language
   called Pig Latin.

   This section provides documentation about installing, upgrading,
   configuring and using Pig with MapR, but it does not duplicate Apache
   documentation.

   You can also refer to additional documentation available on the
   [1]Apache Pig website.
