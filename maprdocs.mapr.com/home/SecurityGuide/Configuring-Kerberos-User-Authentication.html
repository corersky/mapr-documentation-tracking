Configuring Kerberos

   Describes how Kerberos works with MapR tickets.

Configuring Kerberos for Authentication Using MapR Tickets

   To use Kerberos to generate MapR [1]Managing Tickets for users, enable
   Kerberos on the CLDB by creating a Kerberos identity on the Kerberos
   server used by the cluster and distributing that identity to the other
   CLDB nodes in the cluster.
   Note: You must enable wire-level security on your clusters before using
   Kerberos. See [2]Enabling Wire-level Security.

   MapR clusters do not provide Kerberos infrastructure. This section
   assumes you have a functioning Kerberos realm and your systems have the
   Kerberos client installed. The tips in this section assume a
   Linux-based Kerberos environment, and the specific commands for your
   environment may vary. Please consult with your Kerberos administrator
   for assistance.
   Important:

   If you are using strong encryption with Kerberos with the Oracle JDK,
   you will require a new [3]Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy
   file.

Creating a Kerberos Identity for the CLDB

   The CLDB requires a Kerberos server identity, but no other nodes do. By
   default, this identity takes the form mapr/<cluster name>. You can use
   [4]configure.sh or edit the mapr-clusters.conf file to change this
   default. Use the following commands in a Linux-based Kerberos
   environment to set up the identity:
kadmin
        : addprinc -randkey mapr/my.cluster.com
        : ktadd -k /opt/mapr/conf/mapr.keytab mapr/my.cluster.com

   Copy the resulting mapr.keytab file to the same location on every CLDB
   node. The mapr.keytab file must be owned and readable only by the mapr
   user. You can specify the location of the mapr.keytab file in the
   conf/mapr.login.conf file. The default location for mapr.keytab is
   /opt/mapr/conf.

Updating the keytab File

   You can use the kadmin tool to update the server keys that are stored
   in the keytab file. Because the server tickets used to authenticate to
   the CLDB use the new keys immediately, you must copy the new keytab
   file to all the CLDB servers in the cluster immediately after updating
   the server keys.

   To update the keytab file with a new key, run the following command:
kadmin
        : ktadd -k /opt/mapr/conf/mapr.keytab mapr/my.cluster.com

   The CLDB automatically detects changes to the keytab file on systems
   that use Java 7 or later. Systems that use Java 6 require a CLDB
   restart to detect changes to the keytab file.
   Note:

   Starting with the 4.0.1 release of the MapR software, Java 6 is
   deprecated in favor of Java 7 and Java 8.

Running configure.sh

   After a Kerberos principal is created for the CLDB, that principal is
   added to the mapr.keytab file, and the mapr.keytab file is copied to
   all the CLDB servers, Kerberos user authentication is fully enabled for
   the MapR cluster.

   Two configure.sh parameters are important for Kerberos:
     * -K|-kerberosEnable - lets the rest of the cluster know that
       Kerberos is enabled, so that clients can auto detect Kerberos
       tickets and use them to get MapR tickets.
     * -P "<cldbPrincipal>"- specifies the Kerberos instance which is used
       to form the CLDB Kerberos principal in the form of
       mapr/<instance-name>@<realm-name>. Enclose this value in quotes
       (").

   Run configure.sh on each MapR cluster node, and each MapR client node
   that will communicate with one or more clusters. For more information
   on , see [5]configure.sh.
configure.sh -K -P "<cldbPrincipal>"

   Running configure.sh on each node enters the Kerberos information into
   the local clusters.conf file, so that the following command is all that
   is required for the client to access the cluster:
hadoop fs -ls

   If you do not run configure.sh on each node, the following two commands
   are required from the client:
maprlogin kerberos
hadoop fs -ls

Kerberos Command Summary

     * kinit: Creates a Kerberos ticket. Prompts the user for userid and
       password. After validating, Kerberos creates a ticket file in /tmp
       that is owned by the user. Use the -R option to renew an existing
       ticket. Kerberos credentials expire in 8-10 hours. Expired
       credentials must be renewed or replaced. By default, tickets can be
       renewed for up to 24 hours.
     * klist: Lists the contents of the user's ticket file.
     * kdestroy: Destroys the contents of the user's ticket file. The user
       is no longer authenticated.
     * kadmin: Used to administer Kerberos. The login for this command is
       implicitly <userid>/admin, since administrator ids typically end in
       /admin.
     * ktutil: Kerberos keytab maintenance utility. Used to combine, or
       alter Kerberos keytabs.

Disabling Replay Detection for Kerberos Authentication

   You can set an option in mapr-clusters.conf to disable replay detection
   for Kerberos runtime authentication.
disableReplayDetection=true

   By default, this parameter is set to false, meaning that MapR clients
   enable Kerberos replay detection. Typically, replay detection is
   enabled to prevent potential attacks such as the replay of Kerberos
   packets or multiple login attempts with the same user ID. Set this
   parameter to true only if you want MapR clients not to enforce this
   detection.

   This parameter applies when users attempt an implicit or explicit
   maprlogin, such as by using the maprlogin kerberos command or by
   submitting jobs and other operations with kerberosEnable=true set in
   the mapr-clusters.conf file.

   This parameter is used when applications connect to the cluster using
   Kerberos; mapr-clusters.conf only needs to be updated when it is used
   by such applications. If all Kerberos access to the cluster is from
   clients outside the cluster, only the mapr-clusters.conf file on those
   client machines has to be updated. If Kerberos is used from
   applications running on the cluster, mapr-clusters.conf should be
   updated there as well.
