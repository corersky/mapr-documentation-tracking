Using ACEs for MapR-FS

   Access Control Expressions (ACEs) for MapR-FS allow you to define
   whitelists (to grant access) and blacklists (to deny access) for a
   combination of users, roles, and groups. You can grant different
   permissions to multiple users, groups, and roles for files,
   directories, and whole volume data using boolean expressions and
   subexpressions.

ACEs for Files, Directories, and Whole Volume

   An ACE is defined by a combination of user, group, and/or role
   definitions. You can combine these definitions using the supported
   syntax. For more information, see [1]Syntax of Access Control
   Expressions.

   The examples in the following table demonstrate how ACEs can be used to
   create whitelists, to grant access, and blacklists, to deny access.
   This Access Control Expression... Grants access to... Denies access
   to...
   (u:u1&g:g1) only user 'u1', if user 'u1' is a member of group 'g1'
   users who are not 'u1' and members of group 'g1'
   (g:g1&g:g2)|r:r1 only users who are in both the groups 'g1' and 'g2',
   or users who are assigned role 'r1' users who are not in both the
   groups 'g1' and 'g2', and users who are not assigned role 'r1'
   (g:g1&!g:g2) only users who are in group 'g1' and not in group 'g2'
   users who are in group 'g2', even if they are in group 'g1', and all
   other users
   (g:g1|g:g2) users who are in groups 'g1' or 'g2' only users who are not
   in groups 'g1' or 'g2'
   (g:g1|g:g2)&!r:r1 only users in groups 'g1' or 'g2' and who are not
   assigned role 'r1' users who are not members of groups 'g1' or 'g2',
   users who are assigned role 'r1', even if they are in group 'g1' or
   'g2', and all other users
   (p) everyone none
   (!g:g1&!g:g2&!g:g3) users who are not in groups 'g1', 'g2', and 'g3'
   only users who are in groups 'g1', 'g2', or 'g3'
   ((u:u1|u:u2|u:u3)&g:g1&g:g2)&!r:r1 only users 'u1', 'u2', or 'u3', who
   are also members in groups 'g1' and 'g2', but not assigned role 'r1'
   users who are not 'u1', 'u2', or 'u3' and members of groups 'g1' and
   'g2', and users who are assigned role 'r1'
   (u:u1|u:u2|u:u3)&g:g1|g:g2 only users who are 'u1’, ‘u2', or 'u3' and
   who are members in groups 'g1' or 'g2' users who are not 'u1', 'u2', or
   'u3' and members of groups 'g1' or 'g2'
   Note: The entities — user, group, role, and public — must be the same
   for MapR-FS and MapR-DB ACEs.
