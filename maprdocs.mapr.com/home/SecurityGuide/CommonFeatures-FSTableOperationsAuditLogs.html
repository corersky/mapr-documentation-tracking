Common Features of Audit Logs for Filesystem, Table, and Stream Operations

   Entries for audit logs are initially held in memory until 128
   operations have been logged or 10 seconds have elapsed, whichever
   happens first. At that point, the new log entries are flushed to disk.

   Audit logs are in JSON format, so they can be queried by Drill or
   processed by other third-party tools or your own scripts.

   Audit logs are readable only by the mapr and root users on the cluster
   where the logs are located. These users can also copy and delete audit
   logs.

   The status field in every log entry shows the status of the attempted
   operation. The status codes are taken from the Linux errno.h file. For
   a list of these codes, see [1]Status Codes That Can Appear in Audit
   Logs.

   Audit logs use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the records of
   audited operations.

   When operations are performed on directories, files, or tables that are
   being audited, the full names for those objects, as well as the current
   volume and the name of the user performing the operation, are not
   immediately available to the auditing feature. What are immediately
   available are IDs for those objects and users. Converting IDs to names
   at run-time would be costly for performance. Therefore, audit logs
   contain file identifiers (FIDs) for directories, files, and tables;
   volume identifiers for volume; and user identifiers (UIDs) for users.

   You can resolve identifiers into names by using the [2]expandaudit
   utility. This utility creates a copy of the log files for a specified
   volume, and in that copy are the names of the filesystem objects,
   users, and volumes that are in the audit log records. You can then
   query or process the copy.
   Note: There will be an entry in the audit log for each IP address on a
   node. For example, suppose a node with multiple IP addresses. The audit
   log on this node may show multiple entries of the same operation, each
   associated with a different IP address.
