Authorization Architecture: ACLs and ACEs

   Describes the authorization architecture in MapR.

   An Access Control List (ACL) is a list of users or groups. Each user or
   group in the list is paired with a defined set of permissions that
   limit the actions that the user or group can perform on the object
   secured by the ACL. In MapR, the objects secured by ACLs are the job
   queue, volumes, and the cluster itself.

   A job queue ACL controls who can submit jobs to a queue, kill jobs, or
   modify their priority. A volume-level ACL controls which users and
   groups have administrative access to that volume, and what actions they
   may perform, such as mirroring the volume, altering the volume
   properties, dumping or backing up the volume, or deleting the volume.

   An Access Control Expression (ACE) is a combination of user, group, and
   role definitions. A role is a custom defined name that is determined
   and implemented by your custom authorization code. It can be a property
   of a user or group that defines a set of behaviors that the user or
   group performs regularly. ACEs are used to secure [1]MapR-FS (files,
   directories, and volumes), [2]MapR-DB, and [3]MapR-Streams that use
   native storage (see [4]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with
   ACEs).
