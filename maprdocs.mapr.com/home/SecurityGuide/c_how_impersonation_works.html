How Impersonation Works

   Introduces impersonation functionality, limitations, and core
   requirements.

   When a user attempts to impersonate another user to the MapR-FS or
   MapR-DB systems and the configuration parameters for resolving the UID
   and GIDs on the server (see [1]Resolving Username with UID and GIDs
   During Impersonation) are disabled:
    1. The MapR client looks for that user name in the local operating
       system registry.
    2. If the user name is:
          + Found, MapR sends the user’s UID and GID to the server for
            impersonation.
          + Not found in the local operating system registry, the user
            action is not processed.

   When a user attempts to impersonate another user to the MapR-FS or
   MapR-DB systems and if the configuration parameters for resolving the
   UID and GIDs on the server (see [2]Resolving Username with UID and GIDs
   During Impersonation) are enabled:
    1. The MapR client asks CLDB to look for that user name and resolve
       the UID and GIDs for that user on the server.
    2. If the user name is:
          + Found on the server, the server allows the user to proceed
            with the impersonation.
          + Not found, the user action is not processed.
       Note: If the configuration property for resolving the username is
       set on the client and the configuration property for resolving the
       username is not set on CLDB, the operation will fail with an error.

Limitations on Impersonation

   Impersonation does not work in MapR when you are accessing MapR-FS or
   MapR-DB through a MapR client running on Windows.

Core Requirements for Impersonation

   The mapr superuser is allowed to access to the MapR-FS and MapR-DB
   systems. The following conditions must be met in order for the mapr
   superuser to be able to impersonate another MapR user:
    1. The hadoop.proxyuser.mapr.groups and hadoop.proxyuser.mapr.hosts
       parameters must be set correctly in the core-site.xml file.
       See [3]Enabling Impersonation for the mapr Superuser.
       These settings are not always required. The hadoop proxy user
       functionality is only applicable to ecosystem components included
       in the MapR distribution for Apache Hadoop. If the MapR client
       accesses an ecosystem component, such as HiveServer2, these
       settings may be required. These settings are never needed when the
       MapR client accesses MapR-FS or MapR-DB directly. Enabling
       impersonation here ensures that the correct settings are in place
       if they are needed.
    2. The name of the MapR user that you want the mapr superuser to be
       able to impersonate must appear in the local operating system
       registry where the MapR client is running if server-side
       [4]resolution of UID and GIDs is not enabled.
    3. The UID and GUID of the user name under which the MapR client is
       running must match exactly the UID and GUID for that user name on
       the server.

   For all other users with access to the MapR-FS and MapR-DB systems, the
   following conditions must be met for the user to impersonate another
   user.
    1. A valid servicewithimpersonation ticket must be present for the
       user who intends to impersonate on the system.
    2. The name of the MapR user to impersonate must appear in the local
       operating system registry where the MapR client is running if
       server-side [5]resolution of UID and GIDs is not enabled.
    3. The UID and GUID of the user name under which the MapR client is
       running must match exactly the UID and GUID for that user name on
       the server.

   Note: If a user is not authorized to impersonate, then the operations
   will proceed as the user, not the target user, and some operations will
   succeed, and some will not even if the user has all the permissions for
   these operations. Also, if a user with full access and impersonating
   capability tries to impersonate another user, the operations will
   succeed only if the target user has permissions on the directory.

Component Requirements for Impersonation

   Some MapR ecosystem components have additional requirements to enable
   impersonation.

   The following components must have settings that support impersonation
   in the configuration files indicated, on each node where the component
   resides:
     * Drill: Edit the drill-env.sh file. See [6]Configuring User
       Impersonation in the Apache Drill documentation.
     * Flume: Edit the flume.conf file. See [7]Configure User
       Impersonation for Flume.
     * HBase: Edit the hbasesite.xml file. See [8]Impersonation via the
       HBase REST Gateway.
     * HiveServer2: Edit the hive-site.xml file. See [9]Hive User
       Impersonation.
     * Hue: Edit the hue.ini file. See [10]Configure Hue with Impala.
     * Impala: Does not support impersonation.
     * Oozie: Edit the oozie-site.xml file. See [11]User Impersonation for
       Oozie.
     * Spark: No special settings are required for Spark in MapReduce 2
       (YARN) mode, since Spark automatically inherits the correct
       behavior from YARN. When running standalone, Spark cannot perform
       impersonation and should not be used if security is important.

Application Development Requirements

   You can set up impersonation in an application programmatically.
     * C/C++: Use hb_connection_create_as_user(). See the “C API for
       impersonation” section of [12]Creating C Apps - Binary Tables and
       [13]Impersonation Example..
     * Java: Use UserGroupInformation.doAs(). See [14]Class
       UserGroupInformation in the Hadoop documentation.
