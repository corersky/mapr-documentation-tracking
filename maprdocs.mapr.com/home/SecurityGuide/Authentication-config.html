Configuring Authentication

   Provides information about MapR ticket, Kerberos, Pluggable
   Authentication Module (PAM) authentication.

   Robust authentication prevents third parties from representing
   themselves as legitimate users. The core component of user
   authentication in MapR is the ticket. A ticket is an object that
   contains specific information about a user, an expiration time, and a
   key. Tickets uniquely identify a user and are encrypted to protect
   their contents. Tickets are used to establish sessions between a user
   and the cluster.
   MapR supports two methods of authenticating a user and generating a
   ticket:
     * Kerberos
     * Username/password pairing with PAM

   Both of these methods are mediated by the [1]maprlogin utility. When
   you authenticate with a username/password pair, the system verifies
   credentials using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). You can
   configure the cluster to use any registry that has a PAM module.
