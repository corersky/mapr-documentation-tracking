Setting File and Directory ACEs

   For files and directories, run the [1]hadoop mfs command to set ACEs.
   When ACEs are set, by default, the corresponding POSIX mode bits are
   also set. POSIX mode bits for owner and owning group are deduced by
   evaluating the corresponding ACEs. POSIX mode bits for others is set
   only if "p" is given as the value for an ACE.

   The following table lists the POSIX mode bits that correspond to the
   access types.
                ACEs     POSIX Mode Bits
   File      readfile    r
             writefile   w
             executefile x
   Directory readdir     r
             addchild    w
             deletechild w
             lookupdir   x
   Note: The POSIX mode bit granting write (w) access to directory is set
   only if user, role, or group is granted permission for both (addchild
   and deletechild) access types.

   The hadoop command, by default, sets the POSIX mode bits corresponding
   to the given ACEs, and:
     * Overwrites existing ACE values with new values, if specified, for
       access types that were previously set.
     * Sets ACE values for access types that have not yet been set, if
       specified.
     * Does not modify access types that are not specified with the
       command, whether or not they were previously set.

   Warning: Changing the POSIX mode bits using chmod will not change the
   corresponding ACE setting and may result in different, conflicting
   permissions to files and directories.
