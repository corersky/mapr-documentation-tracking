Setting Up Cross-Cluster Security

   In order for two or more MapR clusters to communicate with one another,
   a secure trust relationship must exist between the clusters. A secure
   trust relationship between clusters is required for running commands
   remotely, creating remote replicas and mirror copies of volumes, and
   accessing data using NFS on the other cluster. The following sections
   describe the [1]quick way to configure both the clusters for mirroring,
   replication, and remote access and the [2]advanced manual way to
   configure the clusters for mirroring, replication, remote access,
   and/or NFS server access.

Quick Configuration

   You can run the [3]configure-crosscluster.sh utility on any CLDB node
   in a cluster to automatically set up a trust relationship between the
   cluster and another cluster. To automatically configure two clusters
   for remote access, mirroring, and replication in both directions:
    1. Log in to the CLDB node on a cluster.
    2. Run the [4]configure-crosscluster.sh utility with the all argument.
       For example:
# /opt/mapr/server/configure-crosscluster.sh create all -remoteip <remote_node_I
P>
       When the utility runs, it performs the following on all the
       clusters:
         a. Updates the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file to include
            the first entry from the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf
            file on the other cluster.
         b. Imports the other cluster's certificate in
            /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore file and copies the updated
            /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore file to all the other nodes on
            the cluster.
         c. Generates a cross-cluster ticket for the other cluster, copies
            the ticket to the CLDB node on the other cluster, merges the
            ticket with the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file on the
            node in the other cluster, and copies the updated
            /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to all other CLDB nodes
            on the other cluster.
       For more information on the arguments, syntax, and options, see
       [5]configure-crosscluster.sh.
    3. Verify access to remote cluster by:
          + Running remote commands on a node in either cluster.
          + Creating mirror volumes on any node in the destination
            cluster.
          + Setting up table and stream replication on tables and streams
            in the source cluster.
       To configure access over NFS, see [6]Configuring Secure Clusters
       for Cross-Cluster NFS Access.

Advanced Configuration

   You can configure the clusters manually for unidirectional or
   bidirectional remote access, mirroring, or replication only. The
   following sections describe the manual steps for:
