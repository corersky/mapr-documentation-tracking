Configuring Access Between Non-Secure MapR and HDFS Clusters

   If the MapR and HDFS clusters are both non-secure, verify that the
   fs.hdfs.impl property in the $HADOOP_HOME/conf/core-site.xml file has
   the following value:
org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem

   No additional configuration is required.
