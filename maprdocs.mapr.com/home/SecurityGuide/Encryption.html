Encryption in MapR

   Describes encryption in a MapR system, which restricts an external
   party's ability to read or modify data.

   Data transmission between nodes in a secure MapR cluster is encrypted,
   preventing an attacker with access to that communication from gaining
   information about the transmission's contents.

   MapR uses several technologies to protect network traffic and data at
   rest:
     * The Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
       protocol secures several channels of HTTP traffic.
     * In compliance with the NIST standard, the Advanced Encryption
       Standard in[1] Galois/Counter Mode (AES/GCM) secures several
       communication channels between cluster components.
     * Kerberos encryption secures several communication paths elsewhere
       in the cluster.

   The [2]Security Protocols Used by MapR in the Architecture section
   includes details on the specific technologies used by particular
   elements of a cluster.
   Nodes with CPUs that support AES encryption at the hardware level will
   provide superior performance on encryption tasks. You can determine if
   a node's CPU supports the AES instruction set by running the following
   command:
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | grep aes
