Enabling Impersonation for any User

   Provides a procedure necessary to implement impersonation for any MapR
   user.

   To enable impersonation for any MapR user:
    1. Log in to the system as root, mapr user, or any user with full
       control.
    2. Generate a servicewithimpersonation ticket for the MapR user.
       For example:
$ maprlogin generateticket -type servicewithimpersonation -user mapruser1 -out /
var/tmp/sample_ticket
    3. Move the ticket to a secure location and share the ticket with the
       user (for whom this ticket was generated).
    4. (Optional) Copy the file to a permanent directory.
