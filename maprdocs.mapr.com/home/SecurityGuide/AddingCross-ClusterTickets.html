Configuring Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster Mirroring and Replication

   Cross-cluster tickets are required on secure clusters that need to pull
   data from another secure cluster and on secure clusters that need to
   push data to another secure cluster. For example:
     * Volume mirroring is a pull operation. The volume data is pulled by
       the destination cluster from the source cluster. Because the
       destination cluster is performing the operation, the destination
       cluster receives a ticket that is generated on the source cluster.
     * Table and streams replication is a push operation. The table or
       stream data is pushed from the source cluster to the destination
       cluster. Because the source cluster is performing the operation,
       the source cluster receives a ticket that is generated on the
       destination cluster.

   You can configure secure clusters for cross-cluster mirroring and
   replication manually (as described below) or automatically by running
   the configure-crosscluster.sh utility. If you choose to run the
   utility, the utility configures the clusters for both mirroring and
   replication in both directions. For more information, see
   [1]configure-crosscluster.sh.

Setting up Secure Clusters Manually for Cross-Cluster Mirroring

   To set up secure clusters for cross-cluster mirroring:
    1. Verify that the user for whom you are configuring access exists in
       the registry on both the clusters and has the following
       permissions:
          + Permissions to mirror volumes on the source cluster.
          + Permissions to create volumes on the destination cluster.
       You can set up access for the mapr user, who already has
       permissions to create volumes and mirror volumes.
    2. Log in to any node on source cluster and perform the following
       steps:
         a. Generate a cross-cluster ticket for the destination cluster
            for this user.
            For example, to generate a cross-cluster for destination
            cluster, run the following command on the source cluster:
source$ /opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin generateticket -type crosscluster -out /tmp/cros
sclusterticket -user destinationclusteruser
         b. Copy the cross-cluster ticket file to any node on destination
            cluster.
            For example:
source$ scp /tmp/crossclusterticket mapr@<dest-ip>:/tmp/sourceClusterTicketFile
    3. Log in to the node in destination cluster where the cross-cluster
       ticket was copied and perform the following steps:
         a. Merge the cross-cluster ticket file with the
            /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file on the node.
            For example, to merge, run the following command:
dest$ cat /tmp/sourceClusterTicketFile >> /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket
         b. Copy the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to the CLDB
            nodes on the destination cluster.
    4. Perform the steps to [2]verify configuration for mirroring.

   You can now create mirror volumes on the destination cluster and set up
   a schedule to pull data from the volumes on the source cluster.
   However, you cannot create volumes on the source cluster that pull data
   from volumes in the destination cluster because the setup described
   above is unidirectional. In order to configure the clusters for
   bidirectional mirroring, repeat the steps above by switching the source
   and destination clusters. For example, suppose there are two clusters,
   clusterA and clusterB, and you performed the steps above for clusterA
   as the source cluster and clusterB as the destination cluster. After
   you complete the steps above, your destination cluster, clusterB can
   pull data from volumes on clusterA. In order for clusterA to mirror
   data on clusterB, perform the steps above with clusterB as the source
   cluster and clusterA as the destination cluster.

Setting up Secure Clusters Manually for Cross-Cluster Replication

   To set up secure clusters for cross-cluster replication:
    1. Verify that the user, for whom you are configuring access, exists
       in the registry on the destination cluster.
    2. Log in to any node on the destination cluster and perform the
       following steps:
         a. Generate a cross-cluster ticket for the source cluster.
            For example, to generate a cross-cluster for the source
            cluster, run the following command on the destination cluster:
dest$ /opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin generateticket -type crosscluster -out /tmp/crossc
lusterticket -user destinationclusteruser
         b. Copy the cross-cluster ticket file to any node on the source
            cluster.
            For example:
dest$ scp /tmp/crossclusterticket mapr@<source-ip>:/tmp/sourceClusterTicketFile
    3. Log in to the node in the source cluster where the cross-cluster
       ticket was copied and perform the following steps:
         a. Merge the cross-cluster ticket file with the
            /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file on the node.
            For example, to merge, run the following command:
cat /tmp/destinationClusterTicketFile >> /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket
         b. Copy the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to all the nodes
            on the source cluster.
    4. Configure the Gateway for table and streams replication.
       See [3]Configuring Gateways for Table and Stream Replication for
       more information.
    5. Perform the steps to [4]verify configuration for replication.

   You can now set up volumes on the source cluster to push data to
   replicas on the destination cluster. However, you cannot create
   replicas on the source cluster that get data from volumes in the
   destination cluster because the setup described above is
   unidirectional. In order to configure the clusters for bidirectional
   replication, repeat the steps above by switching the source and
   destination clusters. For example, suppose there are two clusters,
   clusterA and clusterB, and you performed the steps above for clusterA
   as the source cluster and clusterB as the destination cluster. After
   you complete the steps above, your source cluster, clusterA can push
   data to replicas on clusterB. In order for clusterB to replicate data
   on clusterA, perform the steps above with clusterB as the source
   cluster and clusterA as the destination cluster.

Verifying Cross-Cluster Configuration for Mirroring and Replication

   You can verify the cross-cluster configuration for:
    1. Mirroring by logging in to a node on the destination cluster as the
       user for whom access was configured and creating a mirror volume on
       the destination cluster for a volume on the source cluster.
       You can create mirror volumes using [5]MCS and/or the [6]CLI.
    2. Replication by logging in to a node on the source cluster as the
       user for whom access was configured and creating a replica in the
       destination cluster for a volume, table, and stream on the source
       cluster.
       You can create replicas using MCS and the CLI. To set up
       replication on secure clusters for:
          + Tables, refer to documentation for [7]MCS and/or the [8]CLI.
          + Streams, refer to documentation for for [9]MCS and/or the
            [10]CLI.
