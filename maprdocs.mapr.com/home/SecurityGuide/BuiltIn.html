Built-in Security in MapR

   Introduces a new security setting for MapR platform and ecosystem
   security.

Security with a Single Click

   You can secure new MapR installations with a single click. Wired
   encryption and authentication (including impersonation) for the MapR
   platform and all supported ecosystem products are enabled for new
   installations through the [1]MapR Installer.
     * The [2]Enable MapR Secure Cluster option is checked by default for
       new installations.
     * To disable security, deselect Enable MapR Secure Cluster before
       starting the installation using the MapR Installer. If you need to
       add security later, you can do so by selecting the option during an
       Incremental Install operation.
     * Note that some [3]exceptions to built-in security may require
       manual intervention.

   Note: Before enabling security using the Incremental Install function,
   be sure to review the known issue (IN-1084) related to custom
   certificates. See [4]MapR Installer Known Issues.

Security and Ecosystem Components

   Not all ecosystem components can be secured by the MapR Installer. The
   following table lists the MEP 4.0.0 ecosystem components that support
   security when installed using the MapR Installer or MapR Installer
   Stanzas:
   Component Supports Security Notes
   AsynchHBase N/A Security is not applicable. This component acts as a
   library.
   Drill Yes For more information about Drill security, see [5]Securing
   Drill.
   Flume N/A Flume is installed as a library but works like a service
   after the agents are started. For more information, see [6]Configure a
   Secure MapR-FS Sink.
   HBase REST / Thrift Gateway No Built-in security is not available.
   Hive Yes For more information, see [7]Hive Security.
   Httpfs Yes For more information, see [8]Configuring HttpFS.
   Hue Yes For more information, see [9]Configure Hue with Security.
   Impala No This component can be configured to run on a secure MapR
   cluster. Security must be configured manually.
   Kafka-Connect No Built-in security is not available.
   Kafka-REST Yes For more information, see [10]User Impersonation and
   [11]SSL Security Configuration.
   Livy No For more information, see [12]Configure Livy.
   MapR Installer 1.7 Yes For more information, see [13]Using the Enable
   MapR Secure Cluster Option.
   Myriad N/A This component can be configured to run on a secure MapR
   cluster.
   Oozie Yes For more information, see [14]Configuring Oozie on a Secure
   Cluster.
   Pig N/A Security is not applicable. This component acts as a library.
   Sentry No This component can be configured to run on a secure MapR
   cluster. Security must be configured manually.
   Spark Yes For more information, see [15]Spark configure.sh.
   Sqoop 1 N/A Security is not applicable. This component acts as a
   library.
   Sqoop2 Yes For more information, see [16]Configuring Sqoop2.
   Timeline Server Yes For more information, see [17]Configuring the
   Timeline Server to Use the Hive-on-Tez User Interface.
   MapR Monitoring Components
   collectd Yes Communicates over MapR streams. See [18]Spyglass on
   Streams.
   ElasticSearch Yes For additional steps that you can take to enhance
   security, see [19]Exceptions to Built-in Security in MapR.
   FluentD Yes For additional steps that you can take to enhance security,
   see [20]Exceptions to Built-in Security in MapR.
   Grafana Yes For additional steps that you can take to enhance security,
   see [21]Exceptions to Built-in Security in MapR.
   Kibana Yes For additional steps that you can take to enhance security,
   see [22]Exceptions to Built-in Security in MapR.
   OpenTSDB Yes Communicates over MapR streams. See [23]Spyglass on
   Streams.
