Authentication Architecture: The maprlogin Utility

   Describes the authentication architecture in MapR.

   The [1]maprlogin utility supports user authentication with either
   username and password or Kerberos to generate a unique session token
   called a ticket. The following diagram outlines the process flow:

   On clusters that use Kerberos for authentication, a MapR ticket is
   implicitly obtained for a user that runs a MapR command without first
   using the maprlogin utility. The implicit authentication flow for the
   maprlogin utility first checks for a valid ticket for the user, and
   uses that ticket if it exists. If a ticket does not exist, the
   maprlogin utility checks if Kerberos is enabled for the cluster, then
   checks for an existing valid Kerberos identity. When the maprlogin
   utility finds a valid Kerberos identity, it generates a ticket for that
   Kerberos identity.

   When you explicitly generate a ticket, you have the option to
   authenticate with your username and password or authenticate with
   Kerberos:
    1. The user on the client machine invokes the maprlogin utility, which
       connects to a CLDB node in the cluster using HTTPS. The hostname
       for the CLDB node is specified in the mapr-clusters.conf file.
         a. When using username/password authentication, the node
            authenticates using PAM modules with the Java Authentication
            and Authorization Service (JAAS). The JAAS configuration is
            specified in the [2]mapr.login.conf file. The system can use
            any registry that has a PAM module available.
         b. When using Kerberos to authenticate, the CLDB node verifies
            the Kerberos principal with the keytab file.
    2. After authenticating, the CLDB node uses the standard UNIX APIs
       getpwnam_r and getgrouplist, which are controlled by the
       /etc/nsswitch.conf file, to determine the user's user IDs and group
       IDs.
    3. The CLDB node generates a ticket and returns it to the client
       machine, completing the login communication between the client and
       the CLDB.
    4. After login, the client communicates with a MapR server. The server
       validates that the ticket is properly encrypted, to verify that the
       ticket was issued by the cluster's CLDB.
    5. The server also verifies that the ticket has not expired or been
       blacklisted.
    6. The server checks the ticket for the presence of a privileged
       identity such as the mapr user. Privileged identities have
       impersonation functionality enabled.
    7. The ticket's user and group information are used for authorization
       to the cluster, unless impersonation is in effect.
