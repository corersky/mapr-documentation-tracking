How Tickets Work

   When an authenticated user runs a client, the client uses that user's
   ticket to communicate securely with the server. After [1]Enabling
   Wire-level Security, supported communications channels between client
   and server are encrypted.

   Nodes use tickets to identify themselves to one another in order to
   prevent spoofing, a condition where an untrusted machine presents
   itself as a trusted machine to gain access to the cluster.

User Blacklisting

   System administrators can use the [2]command line interface to
   blacklist a user. A blacklist command invalidates all of a user's
   tickets. Once a blacklist command is received by the CLDB, the name of
   the blacklisted user is sent to all FileServer nodes, which reject any
   request sent by that user that has a ticket older than the blacklist's
   time stamp. Due to the nature of this check, there is no explicit
   removal of a blacklist. Issuing a new ticket with a time stamp more
   recent than the blacklist's time stamp implicitly removes the user from
   the blacklist. To permanently prevent a user from logging in again,
   revoke the user's credentials in the PAM registry.

What Blacklisting Affects

   A blacklisted user cannot access the MapR file system or the CLDB, but
   since blacklisting only revokes a user's existing valid tickets, be
   aware of the following interactions:
     * Blacklisting has no effect on Oozie's cached credentials in
       ~/.oozie-auth-token, and has no effect on Oozie in general, even
       after a restart.
     * Blacklisting does not affect a new authentication with user ID and
       password or with existing Kerberos credentials.
     * Since NFS does not use MapR tickets, blacklisting does not affect
       NFS access.
     * Blacklisted users can still be impersonated as impersonation does
       not check whether a user is blacklisted or not.
