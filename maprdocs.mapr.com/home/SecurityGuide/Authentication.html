Authentication in MapR

   Describes robust MapR authentication that prevents third parties from
   representing themselves as legitimate users.

   Authentication ensures that the identity of the end user or system
   (call principal) is known reliably in a network safe way. The core
   component of user authentication in MapR is the ticket. A ticket is an
   object that contains specific information about a user, an expiration
   time, and a key. Tickets uniquely identify a user and are encrypted to
   protect their contents. Tickets are used to establish sessions between
   a user and the cluster.

   MapR supports two methods of authenticating a user and generating a
   ticket: a username/password pair and Kerberos. Both of these methods
   are mediated by the [1]maprlogin utility. When you authenticate with a
   username/password pair, the system verifies credentials using Pluggable
   Authentication Modules (PAM). You can configure the cluster to use any
   registry that has a PAM module.

   MapR tickets contain the following information:
     * UID (generated from the UNIX user ID)
     * GIDs (group IDs for each group the user belongs to)
     * ticket creation time
     * ticket expiration time (by default, 14 days)
     * renewal expiration time (by default, 30 days from date of ticket
       creation)

   A MapR ticket determines the user's identity and the system uses the
   ticket as the basis for authorization decisions. A MapR cluster with
   security features enabled does not rely on the client-side operating
   system identity.

   The [2]Security Architecture section discusses the implementation
   details of these authentication methods.
