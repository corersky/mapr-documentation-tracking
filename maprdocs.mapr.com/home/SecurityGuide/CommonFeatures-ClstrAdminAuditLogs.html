Viewing Audit Logs for Cluster Administration

   Entries for audit logs are initially held in memory until 128
   operations have been logged or 10 seconds have elapsed, whichever
   happens first. At that point, the new log entries are flushed to disk.

   Audit logs are in JSON format, so they can be queried by Drill or
   processed by other third-party tools or your own scripts.

   Audit logs are readable only by the mapr and root users on the cluster
   where the logs are located. These users can also copy and delete audit
   logs.

   The status field in every log entry shows the status of the attempted
   operation. The status codes are taken from the Linux errno.h file. For
   a list of these codes, see [1]Status Codes That Can Appear in Audit
   Logs.

   Audit logs use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the records of
   audited operations.

   The cleanup of old audit log files is handled by warden either when
   they are older than 10 days (the default retention time) or when they
   are older than the number of days set for the log.retention.time
   parameter in the /opr/map/conf/warden.conf file. To prevent warden from
   removing the log files, by default, cldbaudit* and authaudit* are
   listed under the log.retention.exceptions parameter in the warden.conf
   file.

   To enable warden to automatically cleanup log files, remove cldbaudit*
   and authaudit* from the log.retention.exceptions parameter in the
   warden.conf file and, if you want a shorter cleanup time, set the value
   for log.retention.time parameter in the warden.conf file. The value for
   log.retention.time must be specified in milliseconds.
