Deleting File and Directory ACEs

   You can remove all ACEs associated with a file or directory using the
   [1]hadoop mfs -delace command. When you delete all the ACEs, the system
   sets the ACE for the file or directory to the default value, which is
   the empty string (""). The POSIX mode bits are not reset; if necessary,
   run the chmod command to reset POSIX mode bits.

   You cannot remove specific access types that have been set; instead,
   use the empty string to deny specific types of access. When the empty
   string ("") is used to deny a specific type of access, that type of
   access is denied to all users, groups, and roles. To deny access to
   specific users only, use the negation operator (!). If you use the
   empty string ("") or the negation operation (!) to deny a specific type
   of access, the corresponding POSIX mode bit are also reset to match the
   ACE setting.
