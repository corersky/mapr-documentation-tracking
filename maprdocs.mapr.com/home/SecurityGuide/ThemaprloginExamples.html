maprlogin Command Examples

   Describes common scenarios associated with maprlogin usage.

Generating and Displaying User Ticket

   Generate a user ticket:
$ maprlogin password
[Password for user 'juser' at cluster 'my.cluster.com': ]
MapR credentials of user 'juser' for cluster 'my.cluster.com'
are written to '/tmp/maprticket_1000'

   Display the ticket for the current user. Sample output is shown below.
$ maprlogin print
Opening keyfile /tmp/maprticket_1000
my.cluster.com: user = juser,
created = 'Sun Nov 24 18:59:43 PST 2017', expires = 'Sun Dec 08 18:59:43 PST 201
7',
RenewalTill = 'Tue Dec 24 18:59:43 PST 2017',
uid = 1000, gids = 1000, 4, 24, 27, 30, 46, 109, 124

Generating and Displaying Service Ticket

   Generate a service ticket, longlived_ticket, in /tmp for maprUser1:
$ maprlogin generateticket -type service -out /tmp/ticketwithduration
-duration 30:0:0 -renewal 90:0:0 -user maprUser1
MapR credentials of user 'maprUser1' for cluster 'JSKCluster129_secure'
are written to '/tmp/longlived_ticket'

   Display the service ticket in a specified location:
$ maprlogin print -ticketfile /tmp/ticketwithduration
Opening keyfile /tmp/ticketwithduration
JSKCluster129_secure: user = maprUser1,
created = 'Tue Jun 14 11:12:01 PDT 2017', expires = 'Thu Jul 14 11:12:01 PDT 201
7',
RenewalTill = 'Mon Sep 12 11:12:01 PDT 2017',
uid = 0, gids = 0, CanImpersonate = false

Generating and Printing Service with Impersonation Ticket

   Generate a service with impersonation ticket (in /var/tmp) for
   maprUser1:
$ maprlogin generateticket -type servicewithimpersonation -user maprUser1
-out /var/tmp/impersonationTicketMapRuser1

   After generating the ticket, ensure that maprUser1 has read permissions
   on the ticket. If you move the ticketfile to a different location, set
   the $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable.

   Display the service with impersonation ticket in the specified
   location:
$ maprlogin print -ticketfile /var/tmp/impersonationTcketMaprUser1
Opening keyfile /var/tmp/impersonationTcketMaprUser1
JSKCluster129_secure: user = maprUser1,
created = 'Mon Apr 18 13:46:38 PDT 2017', expires = 'Mon May 02 13:46:38 PDT 201
7',
RenewalTill = 'Wed May 18 13:46:38 PDT 2017',
uid = 501, gids = 502, CanImpersonate = true

Generating and Printing a Tenant Ticket

   Generate a tenant ticket (in /var/tmp) for tenantUser1:
$ maprlogin generateticket -type tenant -ips ipaddress1,ipaddress2,ipaddress3
-cluster myCluster -user tenantUser1 -out /var/tmp/

   Display the tenant ticket in the specified location:
$ maprlogin print -ticketfile /var/tmp/tenant_user_ticket
Opening keyfile /user/cAdmin/tenant_user_ticket.txt
tenantHost: user = tenantUser1,
created = 'Mon Jul 11 07:14:53 UTC 2017', expires = 'Mon Jul 11 07:14:53 UTC 120
17',
RenewalTill = 'Mon Jul 11 07:14:53 UTC 12017',
uid = 500, gids = 500, 42, CanImpersonate = true, tenant = true

Generating and Displaying Cross-Cluster Ticket

   Generate a cross-cluster ticket (in /tmp) for maprUser1:
$ maprlogin generateticket -type crosscluster -out /tmp/CrossClusterTicket -user
 maprUser1
MapR credentials of user 'maprUser1' for cluster 'JSKCluster128_secure'
are written to '/tmp/CrossClusterTicket'

   Display the contents of a cross-cluster ticket in the specified
   location:
$ maprlogin print -ticketfile /tmp/crossclusterTicket
Opening keyfile /tmp/crossclusterTicket
ClusterSecure: user = root,
created = 'Fri May 27 14:29:40 PDT 2017', expires = 'Fri May 27 14:29:40 PDT 120
17',
RenewalTill = 'Fri May 27 14:29:40 PDT 12017',
uid = 0, gids = 0, CanImpersonate = false

Running an Authentication Test

   authtest: This troubleshooting option simulates the behavior of the
   runtime during authentication, going through the [1]authentication
   flow.

   Options: [ -cluster ] Specifies the name of the cluster.

Ending a Session Before the Ticket Expires

   end or logout: Destroys tickets and logs out.

   Options: [ -cluster ] Specifies the name of the cluster. By default,
   deletes all tickets for all clusters.

Renewing a Ticket Before It Expires

   renew: Renews an existing ticket for a specified time period.
   Options:
     * [ -cluster ] - Specifies the name of the cluster.
     * [ -duration ] - Specifies the ticket duration.

   The duration you specify must be valid for the ticket in question,
   given the original -renewal value for the ticket and the life of the
   ticket when the renew command is run:
     * You cannot renew a ticket that has already expired.
     * You can renew the same ticket multiple times.
     * The renewal period (or periods) cannot exceed the available time
       left for the ticket.

   For example, assume that a ticket is created with a duration of 10 days
   and a renewal of 30 days:
maprlogin password -duration 10:0:0 -renewal 30:0:0
     * On the 11th day, the ticket expires and cannot be renewed at all.
     * On the 9th day, you can renew the ticket for any number of days up
       to a maximum of 21.
     * On the 23rd day, you can renew the ticket for any number of days up
       to a maximum of 7.

   Example: Renew a ticket and display the renewed ticket in the specified
   location:
$ maprlogin renew -out /tmp/RenewedsecureClusterTicket
-ticketfile /tmp/secureClusterTicket -duration 1:0:0

$ maprlogin print -ticketfile /tmp/RenewedsecureClusterTicket
Opening keyfile /tmp/RenewedsecureClusterTicket
JSKCluster129_secure: user = root,
created = 'Tue Jun 07 11:53:29 PDT 2017',
expires = 'Wed Jun 08 11:56:56 PDT 2017',
RenewalTill = 'Thu Jul 07 11:53:29 PDT 2017',
uid = 0, gids = 0, CanImpersonate = false

Error Messages when Accessing Secure Clusters without a MapR User Ticket.

   Any user who wants to access a secure cluster must have a MapR user
   ticket. If a user tries to log in without a ticket, an error message
   appears similar to these:
$ hadoop fs -ls
Bad connection to FS. command aborted. exception: failure to login: Unable to ob
tain MapR credentials

$ maprcli node list
ERROR (22) -  You do not have a ticket to communicate with 192.168.57.87:7222.
Retry after obtaining a new ticket using maprlogin
