HTTPS Excluded Ciphers

   By default, the following weak TLS/SSL ciphers are excluded from MapR's
   HTTPS implementation:
     * SSL_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
     * SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
     * SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5

   You can modify this list of excluded ciphers by editing the
   hadoop.ssl.exclude.cipher.suites property in the core-site.xml file.
   Restart the web servers that use the HTTPS protocol after changing the
   list of excluded ciphers. The following web servers use HTTPS:
     * MCS
     * NodeManager
     * ResourceManager
     * HistoryServer
     * CLDB
     * HBase
