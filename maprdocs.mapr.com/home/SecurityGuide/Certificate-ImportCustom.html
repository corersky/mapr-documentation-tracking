Importing Custom SSL Certificates

   You can generate your own ssl_keystore and ssl_truststore files by
   running the configure.sh script with the -nocerts flag. The -nocerts
   flag suppresses automatic generation of keystore and truststore files.
   The location of your own storefiles should also be specified in the
   mapr.login.conf file. Contact MapR Support for assistance in generating
   JKS-format storefiles from your vendor-supplied certificates.

   The default keystore contents are generated during installation. To add
   an existing certificate and its corresponding key from a vendor to the
   keystore, use the keytool command.
   Note: The default password for the keystore is changeit.

   The following steps assume your vendor has delivered the certificate in
   Java KeyStore (JKS) format, or another format supported by the keytool
   utility.
    1. Run the configure.sh script with the -nocerts flag.
    2. Run the keytool command to import your certificate into the
       keystore.
          + Use a syntax similar to the following:
keytool -import -trustcacerts -file
    <certificate>.crt -alias <hostname> -keystore <keystore_location>
    3. Verify that the certificate is now in the keystore using the
       keytool command.
keytool -list -v -keystore <keystore_location>
    4. Contact MapR Support to modify the mapr.login.conf file.
