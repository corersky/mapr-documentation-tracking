Configuring Impersonation without Cluster Security

   Describes how to use impersonation on a non-secure cluster.

   To configure impersonation without enabling cluster security, perform
   the following procedure on the client:
    1. Enable impersonation for each ecosystem component you will use that
       supports impersonation. See Component Requirements for
       Impersonation in [1]How Impersonation Works.
    2. Enable impersonation for the MapR core components. See [2]Enabling
       Impersonation for the mapr Superuser and [3]Enabling Impersonation
       for any User.
    3. On each client system from which you wish to be able to use
       impersonation:
         a. Set a MAPR_IMPERSONATION_ENABLED environment variable with the
            value, true. This value must be set in the environment of any
            process you start that does impersonation.
         b. Create a file in /opt/mapr/conf/proxy/ that has name of the
            mapr superuser or any other user. For the mapr superuser, the
            default file name would be mapr. For all other users, you can
            use their username for the proxy file.
       If the mapr superuser has a different name in your cluster, use
       that name for the proxy file. To verify the mapr superuser name,
       check the mapr.daemon.user= line in the /opt/mapr/conf/daemon.conf
       file on a MapR cluster server.
