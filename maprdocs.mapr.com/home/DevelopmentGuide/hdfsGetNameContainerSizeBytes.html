hdfsGetNameContainerSizeBytes()

   Unique to libMapRClient

   Get the size of the container hosting the path.

   Keeping track of the size of the name container is useful when you are
   creating files that are less than or equal to 64 KB. When the size of
   all of the such files together for one name container exceeds 64 GB,
   operations on the name container can become inefficient. If the size of
   a name container reaches 64 GB, you can switch to a new or different
   volume.
