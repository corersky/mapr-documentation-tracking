Managing Third-Party Libraries

   Any third-party library that is required by a MapReduce program must be
   accessible to the data node that processes the application.

   A data node is a node in the cluster that includes the NodeManager
   role. You can provide the third-party libraries when you submit the
   program, or you can install the third-party libraries on each node that
   processes the application.

Include the third-party libraries with each program

   Including the third-party libraries with each program is the preferred
   method.

   Perform one the following operations to include the third-party jars
   when you submit the program:
     * Package the third-party libraries with the MapReduce jar file. The
       benefit of this method is that the node from which you submit the
       program and the node that runs the program are not required to have
       the libraries files.
     * Use the -libjars parameter to specify the third-party libraries on
       the command line. With this option, the library files are submitted
       to the data node along with the program. The benefit of this method
       is that the node that runs the program does not need to have the
       library files installed. However, the node that submits the program
       must have the library files installed.

Install the third-party libraries on each node that runs the program

   You can also install the third-party libraries on each data node.
   However, this may not be preferred as there could be conflicts between
   library versions or library files.

   To install the third-party libraries on each data node, perform one of
   the following operations:
     * Install the third-party libraries in the following directory on
       each Node Manager node:
       /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x/share/hadoop/common
     * On each node with the NodeManager role, install the required
       third-party libraries and then specify the location(s) of the
       third-party libraries with the HADOOP_CLASSPATH env variable in the
       env_override.sh file. The env_override.sh file is located in the
       following directory: /opt/mapr/conf. For more information about the
       file, see [1]About env_override.sh.
