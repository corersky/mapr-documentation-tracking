hdfs_connect_as_user.c

     * [1]Sample Application
     * [2]Example hdfs_connect_as_user.c File

   This application demonstrates how to create and write to files
   impersonating another user by using the API hdfsConnectAsUser().

   Before running this application, ensure that you have access to a
   cluster running MapR-FS.

   To build and run it, download it from this page and copy it to a MapR
   client or to a system with the mapr-core package installed. Then,
   modify the run.sh script in [3]Building and Running C Applications on
   MapR-FS Clients to point to this sample application. Run the script and
   then run the application.

   The application includes these header files:
     * stdio.h
     * hdfs.h
     * stdlib.h
     * string.h

   Note: The impersonation APIs are defined in hdfs.h.

   The application performs the actions that are described in the
   following sections.

   Takes two usernames and a hostname as input
          After compiling the application, type the following command to
          launch the application and pass in the two usernames (to
          impersonate) and host name:

hdfs_connect_as_user <username1> <username2> <hostname>if (argc < 4) {
  fprintf (stderr, "Provide two usernames to impersonate and the host name\n");
  printf ("USAGE: ./hdfs_connect_as_user mapruser1 mapruser2 10.10.xx.xxx\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

   Stores the values of the arguments
          The application stores the values of the arguments in character
          arrays. The application uses the port, 7222, to connect to the
          given host, and uses character arrays for user directory and
          file path.

char *impersonate_user1 = argv[1];
char *impersonate_user2 = argv[2];
char *host_addr = argv[3];
int port_num = 7222;
char user1_dir[100];
char writePath[100];
int ret_val;

   Populates the directory path and file path
          The application creates a default path for the user directory
          and file.

sprintf(user1_dir, "/tmp/%s_dir", impersonate_user1);
sprintf(writePath, "%s/test_file", user1_dir);

   Sets an RPC timeout
          The hdfsSetRpcTimeout() is specific to the libMapRClient version
          of libhdfs and takes a value that is specified in seconds. The
          default is 99 seconds. If you change this value, set it either
          to 0 (which eliminates timeouts) or to a value greater than 30.

int err = hdfsSetRpcTimeout(30);
if (err) {
  fprintf(stderr, "Failed to set rpc timeout!\n");
  exit(-1);
}

   Connects to the filesystem as the impersonated user
          The application connects to the filesystem as the impersonated
          user (<username1>) using hdfsConnectAsUser(). If successful,
          this operation returns a handle to the filesystem.

printf("Impersonate user: %s\n", impersonate_user1);
printf("Connecting using hdfsConnectAsUser() as user %s\n", impersonate_user1);
hdfsFS fs_handle = hdfsConnectAsUser(host_addr, port_num, impersonate_user1);
if (fs_handle == NULL) {
    printf("hdfsConnectAsUser() failed.\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

   Creates a directory as the impersonated user
          The application creates a directory under /tmp as the
          impersonated user (<username1>).

printf("User1: Create a directory : %s\n", user1_dir);
ret_val = hdfsCreateDirectory(fs_handle, user1_dir);
if (ret_val != EXIT_SUCCESS) {
  printf("hdfsCreateDirectory() failed.\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

   Creates and opens a file
          The application creates a file and opens the file, passing the
          following values to the hdfsOpenFile() function:

          + The handle to the filesystem.
          + A flag to indicate the mode in which to open the file. In this
            case, the flag is O_WRONLY|O_CREAT. This flag creates the file
            and opens it for writing.

          For more details, see hdfsOpenFile() documentation.

printf("User1: Create and write to the file as user1 : %s\n", writePath);
hdfsFile writeFile = hdfsOpenFile(fs_handle, writePath, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, 0, 0,
0);
if(!writeFile) {
  printf("hdfsOpenFile() failed.\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

   Writes to the open file
          The application writes to the open file as the impersonated user
          (<username1>).

char* buffer = "Hello, from user 1!";
tSize num_written_bytes = hdfsWrite(fs_handle, writeFile, (void*)buffer, strlen(
buffer)+1);
if (hdfsFlush(fs_handle, writeFile)) {
  printf("failed to flush %s\n", writePath);
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

   Closes the file
          The application closes the file after successfully writing to
          the file as the impersonated user (<username1>).

printf("User1: Close file %s.\n", writePath);
hdfsCloseFile(fs_handle, writeFile);

   Connects to the filesystem as the impersonating user
          The application connects to the filesystem as the second user
          (<username2>) using hdfsConnectAsUser() and returns a handle to
          the filesystem.

printf("Impersonate user: %s\n", impersonate_user2);
printf("Connecting using hdfsConnectAsUser() as user %s\n", impersonate_user2);
hdfsFS fs_handle2 = hdfsConnectAsUser(host_addr, port_num, impersonate_user2);
if (fs_handle2 == NULL) {
  printf("hdfsConnectAsUser() failed.\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

   Tries to write to the file as the impersonating user
          The application tries to open the file created by the
          impersonated user (<username1>) and write to the file as the
          impersonating user (<username2>). This operation fails as the
          impersonating user (<username2>) is denied access to the file
          created by the impersonated user (<username1>) and the
          application returns error EACCES.

printf("User2: Try opening file created by user1 for writing : %s\n", writePath)
;
hdfsFile writeFile2 = hdfsOpenFile(fs_handle2, writePath, O_WRONLY, 0, 0, 0);
int errNum = errno;
if(writeFile2) {
    printf("User2: hdfsOpenFile() should have failed for %s.\n", impersonate_use
r2);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
} else {
    if (errNum == EACCES) {
        printf("User2: As expected hdfsOpenFile() with EACCES.\n");
    } else {
        printf("User2: hdfsOpenFile() failed with errno:%d expected %d.\n", errN
um, EACCES);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

   Deletes a directory
          The application deletes a directory as the impersonated user
          (<username1>) using the filesystem handle created for this user.

printf("Delete directory : %s\n", user1_dir);
ret_val = hdfsDelete(fs_handle, user1_dir, 1);
if (ret_val != EXIT_SUCCESS) {
  printf("hdfsDelete() failed.\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

   Disconnects the impersonating user
          The application disconnect the impersonating user (<username2>)
          from the filesystem.

printf("Disconnect the impersonation user2.\n");
ret_val = hdfsDisconnect(fs_handle2);
if (ret_val != EXIT_SUCCESS) {
  printf("hdfsDisconnect() failed.\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

   Disconnects the impersonated user
          The application disconnect the impersonated user (<username1>)
          from the filesystem.

printf("Disconnect the impersonation user1.\n");
ret_val = hdfsDisconnect(fs_handle);
if (ret_val != EXIT_SUCCESS) {
  printf("hdfsDisconnect() failed.\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
