hdfsListDirectory()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Gets list of files and directories for a given path. Returns the
   information in a dynamically allocated array of hdfsFileInfo
   structures.

   hdfsFreeFileInfo() should be called to deallocate memory when this
   structure is no longer needed.

   This method is the equivalent of the ls -l command.
