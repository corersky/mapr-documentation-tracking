MapR-FS Application Requirements

   The following tables include the minimal node requirements for building
   and running MapR-FS applications.
     * [1]Java Applications
     * [2]C Applications

                  Node Requirement                 Method(s) to Meet Requirement
   A connection to the MapR cluster.
   Select one of the following options:
     * Install and configure the MapR client.
     * Install the PACC and run an application container.
     * Use the MAPR-FS JAR to connect to the cluster.

   For more information, see [3]Connect to the Cluster.
   Include hadoop-common libraries as a dependency.
   When you compile the application, use the Maven Repository to determine
   the dependencies.The POM file should include the MapR Repository and
   the hadoop-common dependency:
<repositories>
   <repository> <id>mapr-releases</id>
    <url>http://repository.mapr.com/maven/</url>
<snapshots><enabled>false</enabled></snapshots>   <releases><enabled>true</enabl
ed></releases>
</repository>
   </repositories>

<dependencies>
       <dependency>
       <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
       <artifactId>hadoop-common</artifactId>
       <version>${hadoop.version}</version>
       </dependency>
</dependencies>

   When you run the application, include the following in the
   applicationâ€™s classpath: `hadoop classpath`

   For more information, see [4]Compiling and Running a Java Application.
   Note:
   When you develop a Java application, you can use a dependency
   management tool such as Maven to compile your application. However, it
   is recommended that do the following instead:
    1. Compile the Java application without including dependencies
    2. Specify the required classpath when you submit the application to
       the cluster

   If you choose to bundle the JAR file, and there is a mismatch between
   the bundled JAR file and the version that your MapR cluster expects,
   this can result in failures. The failures differ depending on the
   version of MapR you are using. For more information, see [5]Using the
   MapR-FS JAR to Connect to the Cluster.
   Node Requirement Method(s) to Meet Requirement
   A connection to the MapR cluster.
   Select one of the following options:
     * Install and configure the MapR client.
     * Install the PACC and run an application container.

   For more information, see [6]Connect to the Cluster.
   Include the libhdfs libraries and MapR libraries when you compile the
   application. The MapR libraries are available in the following
   location: /opt/mapr/lib

   Link to the libhdfs libraries in the following location:
   MAPR_HOME/hadoop/hadoop-2.x/

   For more information, see [7]Compiling and Running C Applications on
   MapR-FS Clients
