Overview of the MapR-FS C APIs in libMapRClient

   Although you can use the filesystem C APIs to perform other tasks, the
   most common use of the filesystem C APIs is to write to and read from
   files.

   Review the following information for an overview of the steps required
   to use MapR-FS C APIs in libMapRClient:
    1. Create a connection to MapR-FS running on a MapR cluster. For
       information about connections, see [1]Establishing Connections to
       Filesystems.
    2. Create or open a file. You can create explicitly or by calling one
       of the hdfsOpen() APIs and specifying a file that doesnâ€™t exist.
       Opening a file sets the current offset to 0, the first byte in the
       file. You can move file offset explicitly with the hdfsSeek() API.
       Writes done by hdfsWrite() and reads done by hdfsRead() increment
       the offset by the number of bytes written or read.
       Use hdfsTell() to find out what the current offset is.
       For information about how to specify the location of a file to
       create or open, see [2]Specifying Paths to Files and Directories.
    3. Write to or read from the file. When you write to a file, you pass
       a buffer that contains the data that you want to write. Writes can
       be done from the default offset, which is 0 when the file is
       opened, appended to the end of the file, or done from an offset
       that you specify. Write buffers are flushed to the server
       periodically. For more information about writes, see[3]Writing to
       Files.
       When you read from a file, you pass a pointer to a buffer for
       storing the data that is read. Reads can be done from the default
       offset or from an offset that you specify. For more information
       about reads, see [4]Reading from Files.
    4. Close the file.
       Closing a file implicitly flushes any remaining write buffers to
       the server. It also frees resources that are associated with the
       file.
    5. Disconnect from the filesystem.
