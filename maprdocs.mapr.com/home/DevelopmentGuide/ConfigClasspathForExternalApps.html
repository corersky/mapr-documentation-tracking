External Applications and Classpath

   Describes how to configure the class path for external applications.

   MapReduce version 2 applications require the hadoop 2.x or the yarn
   classpath, and other applications that can run on YARN require the yarn
   classpath.

   The method to specify the classpath differs based on how the job or
   application is submitted:
   Method used to Submit the Job Method to Specify Classpath
   The external application uses the hadoop jar or the yarn jar command.
   YARN applications (MapReduce or custom applications) that are submitted
   using the yarn jar command will automatically use the yarn classpath.

   If the external application has a service that submits the job, you can
   set the CLASSPATH environment variable to point to a different
   classpath prior to starting the service. In this case, the hadoop
   classpath that you set in the CLASSPATH environment variable takes
   priority over the hadoop classpath for the hadoop jar command.
   The external application does not use the hadoop jar or the yarn jar
   command.

   Set the classpath using one of the following options:
     * If the external application has a service that submits the job or
       application, you can set the CLASSPATH environment variable to
       point to the hadoop or yarn classpath prior to starting the
       service.
     * Set the classpath within the application.

   Use one of the following methods to get the classpath:
     * hadoop2 classpath or hadoop -yarn classpath: Gets the classpath for
       MRv2 applications.
     * yarn classpath: Gets the classpath for YARN applications (MRv2 or
       other applications that can run on YARN).
