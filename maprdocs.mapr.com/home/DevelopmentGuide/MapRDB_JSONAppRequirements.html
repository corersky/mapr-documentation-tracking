MapR-DB JSON Application Requirements

   The following tables include the minimal node requirements for building
   and running MapR-DB JSON table applications.
     * [1]Java Applications

   Node Requirements Method(s) to Meet Requirement
   A connection to the MapR cluster.
   Select one of the following options:
     * Install and configure the MapR client.
     * Install the PACC and run an application container.
     * Use the MAPR-FS JAR to connect to the cluster.

   For more information, see [2]Connect to the Cluster.
   The OJAI Query Service is installed To use secondary indexes, you may
   need to enable this service. See [3]Preparing Clusters for Querying
   using Secondary Indexes on JSON Tables for more information.
   MapR-DB libraries are configured as a dependency. When you build an
   application, use the Maven Repository to determine the dependencies.
   The POM file should include the MapR Repository and the MapR OJAI
   Driver project.

   When you run the application, provide the dependencies in the
   application's classpath.

   For more information, see [4]Compiling and Running MapR-DB JSON Java
   Applications
   Other items to consider.

   If an ecosystem component, such as Spark, runs or integrates with the
   application, you may need to include additional dependencies in the POM
   file.

   For example, to use the MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark, see
   [5]Configuring the MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark
