Step 5: Build the Application

   Start building an application! This section lists a few of the sample
   applications available on the MapR platform.
   Note: When building and running your application, you may want to use a
   classpath for printing to standard output. The following classpaths are
   available with MapR:

   mapr classpath
          Prints CLASSPATH to standard output. This classpath could be
          used to build your application classpath to run MapR
          applications for YARN and other components.

   mapr clientclasspath
          Prints CLASSPATH for MapR-DB clients to standard output. The
          clientclasspath could be used to build the classpath to run your
          MapR-DB (binary and JSON) and MpaR-ES streams applications.

MapR-DB JSON

   [1]Build Your Java Application
          This section shows how to build a Java application that uses
          OJAI and accesses MapR-DB JSON tables.

   [2]Managing JSON Tables
          This section describes how to create, list, and delete JSON
          tables as well as set permissions and manage column families
          using either the MapR Java API library or the MapR-DB Shell
          commands.

   [3]Creating JSON Documents in OJAI
          This section provides several Java examples of creating a
          document.

   [4]Inserting JSON Documents
          This section shows how to insert a document or data into a
          document store (MapR-DB JSON table) with Java and dbshell.

   [5]Examples: Querying JSON Documents
          This section provides several examples of querying documents.

   [6]MapR-DB JSON MapReduce: Sample App
          This sample Java application extends the Apache Hadoop MapReduce
          framework to read records (JSON documents) from a JSON table and
          inserts new documents into another JSON table. This API library
          allows you to write your own MapReduce applications to write
          data from one JSON table to another.

MapR-DB Binary

   [7]C API Examples
          This section provides examples using the MapR-DB libMapRClient C
          API to operate on MapR-DB binary tables.

   [8]MapR-DB Sample C Application
          This section provides additional sample C applications that
          accesses and performs operations on MapR-DB binary tables.

MapR-ES Streams

   [9]Sample Java Consumer
          This sample Java consumer application iterates through the
          returned records, extracts the value of each message, and prints
          the value to standard output.

   [10]Sample Java Producer
          This sample Java producer application publishes messages to a
          stream topic.

   [11]Developing a MapR-ES C Application
          These sample C applications publish messages to a stream topic
          and consumes the messages.

   [12]Developing MapR-ES Python Applications
          These sample Python applications publish messages to a stream
          topic and consumes the messages.

MapR-FS

   [13]FileAceTest.java
          This Java application demonstrates how to set, get, modify, and
          delete ACEs on files using the Java APIs.

   [14]hdfs_write_revised.c
          This C application demonstrates how to write to files by using
          the hdfsWrite() and hdfsPwrite() APIs.

   [15]hdfs_read_revised.c
          This C application demonstrates how to read from files by using
          the hdfsRead() and hdfsPread() APIs.

   [16]hdfs_connect_as_user.c
          This C application demonstrates how to create and write to files
          impersonating another user by using the hdfsConnectAsUser() API.
