Step 4: Set Up the Development Environment

   Before you start building the application, figure out how your the
   application will connect to the cluster and what the library
   dependencies and installation requirements are.
   Applications are often run on edge nodes which are nodes that are not
   part of the cluster. Setting up an edge node so that it can be used to
   develop and run applications consists of the following steps:
     * Selecting a client that you will use to connect to the cluster.
     * Installing additional clients required for your use case.
     * Determining the application dependencies.

   Note: The dependencies to build and run applications differ based on
   your use case and the various types of data or tools that are part of
   an application.
   The following sub-topics include the various methods to connect to the
   cluster, and minimal requirements to build and run applications.
