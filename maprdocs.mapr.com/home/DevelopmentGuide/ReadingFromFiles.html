Reading from Files

   There are two APIs for reading from files: hdfsRead() and hdfsPread().
   With both hdfsRead() and hdfsPRead(), you pass a pointer to a buffer
   for the runtime to read bytes into and the length of the buffer. There
   maximum length of the buffer is the maximum size of the datatype that
   is used to specify the buffer length. The datatype is a custom
   datatype: tSize, a signed 32-bit integer.

   Both functions return the number of bytes that are actually read.

   For an example of both APIs in action, see [1]hdfs_read_revised.c.

Using hdfsRead()

   Whenever you open a file, the file pointer is placed at offset 0. If
   you want to start reading at an offset other than 0, call hdfsSeek() to
   move the file pointer forward to that offset before you call
   hdfsRead().

   When you call hdfsSeek(), you specify the offset as a value of type
   tOffset, which is a fixed-width, signed 64-byte integer type for
   storing offsets. tOffset is defined in hdfs.h.

   If a file is already open and you are not sure what the current offset
   is, you can find out by calling hdfsTell().

   After hdfsRead() finishes a read operation, the current offset is set
   to the last byte read plus one.

Using hdfsPread()

   With hdfsPread(), you specify the offset at which you want to start
   reading, so you donâ€™t first have to call hdfsSeek() to move to that
   offset.

   However, the offset that you specify does not change the current offset
   in the file. After hdfsPread() finishes the read operation, the current
   offset is not set to the last byte read plus one. Instead, the current
   offset remains as it was before the read operation.
