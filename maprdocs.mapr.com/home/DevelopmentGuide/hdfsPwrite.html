hdfsPwrite()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Writes starting at a specified position in an open file.

   Whereas hdfsWrite() increments the current offset by the amount of
   bytes returned by the API (except in case of error), hdfsPwrite() does
   not change the value of current offset. If the current offset before
   the call to hdfsPwrite() is 0 and you specify the offset 10 for the
   write operation, after the write the current offset remains 0.

   If a call to hdfsPwrite() specifies an offset that is past the end of
   the file, the result is a hole in the file between the previous end of
   the file and the offset at which the write begins.

   You can obtain the size of a file in bytes by calling
   hdfsGetPathInfo().

   Flushes to the server happen automatically at intervals during a write
   operation. After a write operation is finished, either call hdfsFlush()
   explicitly or call hdfsFlush() implicitly by calling hdfsCloseFile() to
   be sure that any data remaining in the write buffer is flushed.

   On error, pending write buffers are flushed to the server.

Signature

tSize hdfsPwrite(hdfsFS fs, hdfsFile file, tOffset position, const void* buffer,
 tSize length)

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   fs The handle of the filesystem where the file is located. Obtain this
   handle with one of the hdfsConnect() APIs.
   file The handle of the file. Obtain this handle with one of the
   hdfsOpenFile() APIs.
   position The offset at which to start writing.
   buffer The data to write.
   length The number of bytes to write. The maximum length is the maximum
   size of tSize.

Return Value

   Returns the number of bytes written, -1 on error.

   Check errno for error codes and meanings.
