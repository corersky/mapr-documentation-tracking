hdfsWrite()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Writes to the specified open file.

   If the file is opened in write-only mode, writes start at offset 0
   because write-only mode causes the content of the file to be truncated
   when the file is opened.

   If the file is opened in append mode, data is appended to the end of
   the file.

   If there are concurrent writes that start at the same offset, only the
   last write to finish persists.

   If a call to hdfsSeek() moves the offset past the end of the file
   before a call to hdfsWrite(), the result is a hole in the file between
   the previous end of the file and the offset at which the write begins.

   You can obtain the size of a file in bytes by calling
   hdfsGetPathInfo().

   Flushes to the server happen automatically at intervals during a write
   operation. After a write operation is finished, either call hdfsFlush()
   explicitly or call hdfsFlush() implicitly by calling hdfsCloseFile() to
   be sure that any data remaining in the write buffer is flushed.

   On error, pending write buffers are flushed to the server.

Signature

tsize hdfsWrite(hdfsFS fs, hdfsFile file, const void* buffer, tSize length)

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   fs The handle of the filesystem where the file is located. Obtain this
   handle with one of the hdfsConnect() APIs.
   file The handle of the file. Obtain this handle with one of the
   hdfsOpenFile() APIs.
   buffer The buffer containing the data to be written.
   length The number of bytes to write. This value cannot be zero. The
   maximum length of the buffer is the maximum size of the tSize data
   type.

Return Value

   Returns the number of bytes written, -1 on error.

   Check errno for error codes and meanings.
