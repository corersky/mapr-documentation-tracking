MapR-ES Application Requirements

   The following tables include the minimal node requirements for building
   and running MapR-ES consumer and producer applications.

Java Applications

   Node Requirement Method(s) to Meet Requirement
   A connection to the MapR cluster.
   Select one of the following options:
     * Install and configure the MapR client.
     * Install the PACC and run an application container.
     * Use the MAPR-FS JAR to connect to the cluster.

   For more information, see [1]Connect to the Cluster.
   The MapR Streams Java Client is installed.

   Install the MapR-ES Java Client. The MapR-ES Java client (mapr-kafka)
   is available as part of the MEP installation. For more information, see
   [2]6.0 Installation.
   Note: The MapR Streams Java Client is include when you install PACC.
   MapR Streams Java client and the MapR Streams project library files are
   configured as an application dependency.

   When you build the application, use the Maven Repository to determine
   the dependencies. The POM file should include the MapR Repository, the
   MapR-ES Java Client dependency, and the MapR-ES project dependency.

   When you run an application, include the dependencies in the
   application's classpath.

   For more information, see [3]Compiling and Running MapR-ES Java Apps
   Other Items

   If an ecosystem component, such as Spark, runs or integrates with the
   application, you may need to include additional dependencies in the POM
   file.
