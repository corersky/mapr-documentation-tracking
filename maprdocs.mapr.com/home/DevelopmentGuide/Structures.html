Structures

   libhdfs defines these structures, which are supported by libMapRClient.

hdfsBuilder

   Supported by libhdfs for hadoop-2.x

   This structure can be passed to hdfsBuilderConnect() for creating
   connections to MapR-FS clusters. In the libMapRClient, four of the
   parameters are ignored. forceNewInstance is ignored, though the header
   file does not indicate this.
struct hdfsBuilder {
    int forceNewInstance;
    const char *nn;
    tPort port;
    const char *kerbTicketCachePath; // Ignored
    const char *userName;            // Ignored
    struct hdfsBuilderConfOpt *opts; // Ignored
};

   Parameters

   nn

   Specifies the CLDB node to connect to when hdfsBuilderConnect() is
   called. This value is set by hdfsBuilderSetNameNode().
     * If default is specified for the host parameter,
       hdfsBuilderConnect() will connect to the first cluster listed in
       the file MAPR_HOME/conf/mapr-clusters.conf. (MAPR_HOME defaults to
       /opt/mapr.)
     * If a hostname or IP address is specified for the host parameter,
       hdfsBuilderConnect(), look in MAPR_HOME/conf/mapr-clusters.conf on
       the client node to match the specified hostname or IP address to a
       CLDB host and port.
          + If they find a match, they try to connect to the cluster and
            all standard features for connections to MapR clusters are
            available. These features include high availability across
            CLDBs and secure connections.
          + If they do not find a match or if they cannot locate a
            mapr-clusters.conf file, they try to connect to the CLDB host
            specified in the call to create the connection. However, the
            standard features for connections to MapR clusters are not
            available. For example, if the cluster is secured, the
            connection will fail.

   port

   Specifies the port to connect to on the CLDB node. This value is set by
   hdfsBuilderSetNameNodePort().

hdfsFileInfo

   Supported by libhdfs for hadoop-2.x

   This structure is returned by hdfsGetPathInfo() and deleted by
   hdfsFreeFileInfo(). It contains information about the file or directory
   that is specified in the call to hdfsGetPathInfo().
   ParameterstObjectKind mKind

   Specifies whether the object is a file or directory.
   char *mName

   Specifies the name of the object.
   tTime mLastMod

   Specifies the epoch time in milliseconds of the last modification to
   the object.
   tOffset mSize

   Specifies the size of the object in bytes.
   short mReplication

   Specifies the count of replicas of the object.
   tOffset mBlockSize

   Specifies the block size for the object.
   char *mOwner

   Specifies the owner of the object.
   char *mGroup

   Specifies the group that is associated with the object.
   short mPermissions

   Specifies the permissions on the object.
   tTime mLastAccess

   Specifies the epoch time in milliseconds at which the object was
   created.
