Data Offload and Purge

   Offload is driven by the MAST Gateway service. For the volumes
   configured for warm or cold tiering, CLDB notifies the MAST Gateway
   service to start the offload. The MAST Gateway service then scans the
   files in the volume and starts the offload by picking the files that
   meet the criteria in the rule associated with the volume.

     * [2]Offloading Data to Cold Tier

   For volumes configured for warm tiering, the MAST Gateway service
   detects the files that meet the criteria in the configured rules,
   collects data to offload from the read-write containers of the
   front-end volume on MFS, and:
    1. Creates the hidden erasure coded volume in the specified topology.
    2. Creates stripes based on the erasure coding scheme.
       For example, for an erasure coding scheme of 4+2 (6), the stripe
       depth is 6x4MB=24MB.
       Note: Data is broken into many fragments (or m pieces) and encoded
       with some extra redundant fragments (or n pieces) to guard against
       disk failures.
    3. Prepares a corresponding metadata on the MapR cluster for the data.
       The MAST Gateway stores the metadata in MapR-DB tables in a
       separate volume associated with the tier.
    4. Offloads the data to the tier.
       Note: Data is offloaded to the tier in the same state, compressed
       or uncompressed, it was stored in the front-end volume. If data
       encryption is enabled on the front-end volume (using dare
       parameter), data is encrypted during and after offload to the
       erasure-coded volume.

   The following illustration shows the CLDB notifying the MAST Gateway
   service to start the offload (#1) and the MAST Gateway fetching data
   from the front-end volume (#2), offloading the data to the associated
   erasure-coded volume (#3), and then writing metadata to the tier volume
   associated with the front-end volume (#4).

   For volumes configured for cold tiering, the MAST Gateway service
   detects the files that meet the criteria in the configured rules,
   collects data to offload from the read-write containers and snapshots
   for the volume on MFS, and:
    1. Packs 64k data chunks into 8MB sized objects.
    2. Creates the bucket on the tier (or remote targe) if the specified
       bucket is already not present on the tier.
    3. Prepares a corresponding metadata on the MapR cluster for the data
       and creates the objects in the tier.
       The MAST Gateway stores the metadata in MapR-DB tables in a
       separate volume associated with the tier.
    4. Offloads the data to the tier using libcurl.
       Note: Data is offloaded to the tier in the same state, compressed
       or uncompressed, it was stored on MFS. If data encryption is
       enabled at the volume level (using the tierencryption parameter),
       data is encrypted during and after offload. See volume create or
       volume modify for more information on the parameter.
       For the offloaded data, the unique object IDs are generated using a
       combination of cluster ID, volume ID, and a unique sequence of
       numbers. For example, the names of the objects in S3 may look
       similar to the following:
0.b258a07.86e.1
0.b258a07.86a.1
0.b258a07.86c.1

   The following illustration shows the CLDB notifying the MAST Gateway
   service to start the offload (#1) and the MAST Gateway fetching data
   from the volume (#2), offloading the data to the third-party storage
   alternative (#3), and then writing metadata to the tier volume
   associated with the volume (#4).

   The MAST Gateway service notifies CLDB when the offload operation
   completes successfully. Entire volumes can be converted from "hot" to
   "warm" or "hot" to "cold" and vice-versa on demand using CLIs. For each
   offloaded volume, MFS stores only the metadata for the offloaded data
   in a volume on the hot tier.
   Note: If the offload fails, an alarm, VOLUME_ALARM_OFFLOAD_FAILURE, is
   raised. Check the log file for more information on the error. For more
   information on logs, see [3]Enabling Debug Logging for MAST Gateway.
   For some errors, CLDB tries to offload the data again after a brief
   wait. For more information, see [4]Retrying Failed Operation.

Purging Data on MFS

   After offloading, metadata is written to the MapR-DB table in a
   separate volume associated with the tier and the data blocks are
   removed from the storage pool in the hot tier. An offload is considered
   successful only when data on all active replicas have been purged (or
   removed from the storage pool to release the disk space on the MapR
   filesystem) in the hot tier.
