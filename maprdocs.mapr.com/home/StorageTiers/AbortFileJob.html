Aborting a Running File-Level Tiering Job

   You can abort an ongoing offload or recall of a file using the MapR
   Control System and the CLI. Aborting a running:
     * Offload operation does not prevent future offloads; if a schedule
       is associated with the volume, data that is still on the cluster is
       automatically offloaded based on the rules as per schedule. You can
       also manually offload data again at any time by running the [1]file
       offload or [2]hadoop mfs command.
     * Recall operation does not prevent future recalls; you can run the
       recall command again to recall the remaining data on the tier.
       Based on the expiry time set on the volume (associated with the
       recalled data), recalled data is offloaded if there are changes or
       purged if there are no changes. See [3]Recalling a Volume to MFS
       for more information.

   For information on aborting a running offload or recall operation using
   (loopbacknfs or FUSE-based) POSIX or NFS clients when maprcli or hadoop
   commands are not available, see [4]Running Tiering Commands when
   maprcli and hadoop Commands are not Available. For information on
   aborting a running volume-level job, see [5]Aborting a Running
   Volume-Level Tiering Job.

Aborting a Running File-Level Offload or Recall Operation Using the CLI and
REST API

     * [6]CLI
     * [7]REST API
