Running Tiering Commands when maprcli and hadoop Commands are not Available

   You can perform offload and/or recall a file with NFS, loopbacknfs, and
   FUSE-based POSIX clients even if [1]maprcli or [2]hadoop commands are
   not available. To perform file-level data tiering operations like
   offload and/or recall using NFS, loopbacknfs, and FUSE-based POSIX
   clients when [3]maprcli or [4]hadoop commands are not available, from
   the mount point, provide the tiering command such as offload, recall,
   tierjobstatus, and/or tierjobabort as described below. When you run the
   command, the command creates a hidden .tier_attributes file that is
   purged immediately after the operation completes.
   Note: When you run the command, the tiering command is triggered
   immediately and storage policy (or rule), if any, at the volume-level
   is ignored.

Usage

/bin/echo "<command> <file-name>" > .tier_attributes

   Note: Do not use echo in the terminal; instead, use /bin/echo.

Options

    Option                            Description
   command The tiering related command to run. The following commands are
   supported:
     * offload
     * recall
     * tierjobstatus
     * tierjobabort

   file-name The name of the file.

Return Values

   On success, the command returns nothing. Otherwise, the command returns
   one of the following:
   Code Message Description
   EEXIST File exists Indicates tier job is queued or is already in
   progress.
   ENOTEMPTY Directory not empty Indicates that tier job queue is full.
   ENOENT No such file or directory Indicates that the specified file or
   job ID does not exist.
   EIO I/O error Indicates that the job could not be submitted. Run the
   tierjobstatus command to determine the reason for this error.
   EINVAL Invalid argument Indicates that the given command is invalid or
   not available. See [5]Options for the list of supported commands.

Examples

   Offload file named test

# /bin/echo "offload test" > .tier_attributes
/bin/echo: write error: File exists

   Recall a file named test

# /bin/echo "recall test" > .tier_attributes
/bin/echo: write error: File exists

   Check the status of a running job for a file

# /bin/echo "tierjobstatus test" > .tier_attributes

   Abort a running job

# /bin/echo "tierjobabort test" > .tier_attributes
/bin/echo: write error: No such file or directory
