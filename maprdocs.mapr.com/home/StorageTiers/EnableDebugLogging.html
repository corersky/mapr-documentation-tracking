Enabling Debug Logging for MAST Gateway

   The MAST Gateway service log file contains alarm messages, error codes,
   and information on the errors. When the mastgateway.log file reaches
   mastgateway.logfile.size.mb/5, a roll over happens and the
   mastgateway.log file is renamed as mastgateway.log.1; also, a new
   mastgateway.log file is created. When the newly created mastgateway.log
   reaches mastgateway.logfile.size.mb/5, a roll over happens again and:
     * The mastgateway.log.1 is renamed as mastgateway.log.2
     * The mastgateway.log is renamed as mastgateway.log.1
     * A new mastgateway.log is created

   This process continues and up to 5 files, whose size is
   mastgateway.logfile.size.mb/5, are created before the oldest log file,
   mastgateway.log.4, is deleted.
   Run the following command to enable debug logging for MAST Gateway:
maprcli trace setlevel -module MASTGateway -level Debug -port 8660
