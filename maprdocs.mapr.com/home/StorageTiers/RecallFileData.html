Recalling a File to MFS Using the CLI and REST API

   You can recall individual files from a storage tier. When you recall a
   file, the MAST Gateway fetches a copy of the data to the cluster. Based
   on the expiration time setting on the volume, recalled data is
   automatically:
     * Offloaded again based on the storage policy (rules) if there are
       changes to the recalled data.
     * Purged when the compactor runs if there are no changes to the
       recalled data.

   See [1]Data Reads, Writes, and Recalls for more information.
   Note: You can recall all data from the tier to the volume. See
   [2]Recalling a Volume to MFS for more information.

Recalling a File Manually Using the CLI

   Run one of the following commands to recall a file:
     *
hadoop mfs -recall <pathToFile>
       For more information, see [3]hadoop mfs.
     *
maprcli file recall -name <pathToFile>
       For more information, see [4]file recall.

   Note: For information on recalling files using (loopbacknfs or
   FUSE-based) POSIX or NFS clients when maprcli or hadoop commands are
   not available, see [5]Running Tiering Commands when maprcli and hadoop
   Commands are not Available.

Recalling a File Using the REST API

   Send a request of type POST to the URL. For example, send a request
   similar to the following:
curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us/rest/file/recall?name=fileName' --user mapr:m
apr
