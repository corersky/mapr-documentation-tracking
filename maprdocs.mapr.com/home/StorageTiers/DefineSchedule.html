Defining a Schedule for Offloading Data

   You can create a schedule using the MapR Control System, the CLI, and
   REST API. After creating a schedule, you can associate it with the
   tiering-enabled volume when you create or modify the volume. If a
   schedule for offloading data is associated with the volume, data is
   offloaded automatically as scheduled based on the rules associated with
   the volume for offloading data. You can also manually trigger the
   maprcli command to offload data.

   The following schedules are available out-of-the-box for offloading
   data:
          Schedule Name        Schedule ID
   Critical data               1
   Important data              2
   Normal data                 3
   Internal Automatic Schedule 4

   For volumes enabled for warm tiering, the Internal Automatic Schedule
   is used by default for offloading data if you do not explicitly assign
   a schedule. For volumes enabled for cold tiering, you must assign a
   schedule to automatically offload data; if you do not assign a
   schedule, data is not offloaded automatically and you must manually run
   the offload command to offload data. You can also create a custom
   schedule and associate it with the volume.
   Note: You cannot remove a schedule associated with a tiering-enabled
   volume.

   See [1]Creating a Schedule for more information.

Defining a Schedule Using the CLI and REST API

     * [2]CLI
     * [3]REST

   Run the following command to create a schedule:
maprcli schedule create -schedule <schedule_objects>

   Send a request of type POST to create a schedule. For example:
curl -k -X POST 'https://<host>:8443/rest/schedule/create?schedule=<schedule_obj
ects>' --user mapr:mapr

   For more inforamtion, see [4]schedule create.
