Static vs. Dynamic Provisioning

   Kubernetes makes a distinction between static and dynamic provisioning
   of storage.

   In static provisioning, a MapR administrator first creates MapR volumes
   (mount points) and then ensures that they are mounted, and a Kubernetes
   administrator exposes those MapR mount points in Kubernetes through
   Kubernetes PersistentVolumes. In a typical static-provisioning
   scenario, a Pod author requests that a Kubernetes admin create a
   PersistentVolume that references an existing MapR mount point with a
   dataset that the Pod author is interested in. This PersistentVolume
   references the MapR FlexVolume plug-in. The FlexVolume plug-in mounts
   and unmounts MapR mount points for the requesting Pod.

   In dynamic provisioning, a Kubernetes administrator creates a set of
   StorageClasses for Pods to invoke. Each StorageClass has a predefined
   set of storage characteristics. Examples of these characteristics
   include the MapR volume advisory quota size and snapshot rules. The Pod
   creator searches the predefined Storage Classes for the one that best
   matches the creator's requirements. When the Pod references this
   StorageClass through a PersistentVolumeClaim, the StorageClass calls
   the MapR Dynamic Provisioner to allocate storage for the requesting Pod
   dynamically.
   To leverage MapR-FS with a Kubernetes cluster, you can create a
   PersistentVolume in Kubernetes. This diagram shows the two ways in
   which the PersistentVolume can be provisioned:

Static Provisioning Implementation

   To accomplish static provisioning, the MapR KDF FlexVolume plug-in is
   deployed to all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster via a Kubernetes
   [1]DaemonSet. The volume plug-in uses the [2]Basic or Platinum POSIX
   client to mount the MapR filesystem (MapR-FS). The information that the
   POSIX client uses to connect to MapR is contained in a Kubernetes
   Volume or PersistentVolume. A MapR ticket inside a Secret, referenced
   by the Kubernetes Volume or PersistentVolume spec, is used to pass
   secure data to the filesystem.

Dynamic Provisioning Implementation

   To accomplish dynamic provisioning, the MapR KDF provisioner is
   deployed as a [3]Kubernetes Deployment to a single node in the
   Kubernetes cluster. The provisioner requests the creation of MapR
   volumes when a container is launched. You can scale your provisioner
   deployment to multiple nodes for high availability. If a provisioner
   Pod is deleted, a new provisioner is started on another worker node in
   the cluster.

   A Kubernetes Administrator must configure at least one storage class
   with MapR parameters (for example, mirroring, snapshots, quotas, and
   other parameters) for use during creation of the MapR volume. The
   storage class passes MapR administrative credentials to the provisioner
   through a Kubernetes Secret. Security for the provisioner is handled
   through role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.
