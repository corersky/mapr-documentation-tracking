Installing MapR and Kubernetes Software on the Same Nodes

   This section describes how to install the configuration files for the
   MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes. In this configuration, MapR and
   Kubernetes software can coexist on the same nodes if certain version
   requirements are met.
   Note: This procedure is presented as a developer preview. Developer
   previews are not tested for production environments, and should be used
   with caution.
   Important: These steps require installing a MapR 6.0.1 or later cluster
   and deploying version 1.0.1 of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes.

Before Installation

   Before installing the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes, note these
   preinstallation requirements:
     * This procedure assumes that the Kubernetes cluster is already
       installed and functioning normally.
     * Ensure that all Kubernetes nodes use the same Linux distribution.
       For example, all nodes can be CentOS nodes, or all nodes can be
       Ubuntu nodes. But a cluster with a mixture of CentOS and Ubuntu
       nodes is not supported.
     * This procedure requires stopping Warden and Zookeeper on all nodes
       in the MapR cluster and then restarting Warden and Zookeeper on all
       nodes. The steps cannot be performed online one node at a time.
     * Do not install the MapR client on a node where the volume plug-in
       configuration file is installed. The MapR client can be installed
       on a node in the Kubernetes cluster, but it must be installed
       before the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes is installed on the same
       Kubernetes cluster.

   CAUTION:
   Do not try to install the volume plug-in without following the steps
   below. Doing so can cause MapR libraries to be overwritten.

Install the MapR 6.0.1 or Later Cluster on the Kubernetes Nodes

   Use any of the methods described in [1]Installing with the MapR
   Installer to install a MapR 6.0.1 or later cluster on the existing
   Kubernetes nodes.

Install the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes

   Use these steps to install the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes on the
   Kubernetes cluster:
    1. On the MapR cluster, stop all running jobs.
    2. Stop Warden on all MapR cluster nodes
service mapr-warden stop
    3. Stop Zookeeper on all MapR Zookeeper nodes:
service mapr-zookeeper stop
    4. Deploy the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes components by using
       steps 1 through 6 of [2]Installing MapR and Kubernetes Software on
       Separate Nodes.
    5. Configure the MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable to ensure that MapR
       software does not use the docker0 network interface on each node.
       See [3]Designating NICs for MapR.
       If MAPR_SUBNETS is not set, the CLDB uses all NICs present on the
       node. When Docker is installed on a node, thedocker0 bridge is
       created as a virtual NIC for use by the Docker containers. You must
       configure the MAPR_SUBNET setting to include the physical NICs that
       you want the CLDB to use and exclude the docker0 network interface.
       In this way, you can avoid issues with duplicate or non-routable IP
       addresses. For more information about docker0, see [4]Docker
       container networking.
    6. On all MapR Zookeepr nodes, start Zookeeper:
service mapr-zookeeper start
    7. On all MapR nodes, start Warden
service mapr-warden start
