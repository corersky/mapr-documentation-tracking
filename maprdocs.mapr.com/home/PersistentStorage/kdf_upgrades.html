Upgrading the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes

   This section describes how to upgrade the plug-in and dynamic
   provisioner, or upgrade Pods with attached volumes.

Upgrading the Plug-in and Provisioner

   Before upgrading the plug-in, stop any Pods using the plug-in. You may
   want to quiesce any traffic hitting the Pod before shutdown. Failure to
   shut down the Pods before replacing the plug-in can lead to the Pod not
   being able to access its data until it is restarted.

   Removing the plug-in does not kill existing Pods. The Pods should only
   lose their mounted storage when a new version of the plug-in is
   installed and the libraries used to communicate with MapR software are
   deleted.

   Upgrading the provisioner does not require stopping Pods, but dynamic
   provisioning (creating MapR volumes for new PersistentVolumeClaims)
   will be unavailable during the provisioner upgrade.

   Use these steps to upgrade the plug-in:
    1. Stop any Pods using the the plug-in to be upgraded. Before shutting
       down the Pod, you might want to quiesce any traffic hitting the
       Pod.
       Note: If any Pods that use the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes are
       not shut down during the plug-in upgrade, those Pods will have
       mount access removed and will need to be deleted and re-created as
       new Pods. If existing Pods need to be removed or are stuck in the
       Terminating state, you can delete them forcefully by using the
       kubectl delete pod command:
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <pod-namespace> --force --grace-period=0
    2. Download the new plug-in. See [1]Downloads.
    3. Delete the old plug-in:
kubectl delete -f kdf-<old_plugin>.yaml
    4. Deploy the new plugin:
kubectl create -f kdf-<new_plugin>.yaml

Upgrading Pods with Attached Volumes

   Pods with mounted volumes can be patched in place. See [2]Update API
   Objects in Place Using kubectl patch. Volumes will disappear only when
   the Pod is deleted. Patching a Pod does not affect the mount. When a
   Pod is deleted, a volume disappears. However, if you delete a Pod using
   a PersistentVolume and you leave the PVC alive, you can remount the
   PersistentVolumeClaim and its PersistentVolume with a new Pod. In this
   scenario, there is no disruption or need to recreate the
   PersistentVolume.
