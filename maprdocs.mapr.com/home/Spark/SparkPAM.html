PAM Authentication for Spark

   Spark supports PAM authentication on secure MapR clusters.

   In MEP-5.0.0, PAM authentication and encryption is enabled by default
   for all Spark Web UIs. After running configure.sh, if the cluster is
   secure and Spark is installed, Spark will be configured using PAM.
   Note: Spark PAM is available in Spark-2.2.1 from MEP-5.0 and in
   Spark-2.1.0 from MEP-4.1.1.

   See [1]Configuring PAM for information on how PAM works with MapR.
