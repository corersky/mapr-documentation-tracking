Loading Data from MapR-DB Using the MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark

   The MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark supports loading data as an
   Apache Spark RDD. Starting in the MEP 4.0 release, the connector
   introduces support for Apache Spark DataFrames and Datasets. DataFrames
   and Datasets perform better than RDDs. Whether you load your MapR-DB
   data as a DataFrame or Dataset depends on the APIs you prefer to use.
   It is also possible to convert an RDD to a DataFrame.
