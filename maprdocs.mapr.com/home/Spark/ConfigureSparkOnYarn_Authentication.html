Configure Authentication for Spark on YARN

   When authentication is enabled, authentication keys are randomly
   generated for each job.
   Note: Starting in MEP 4.0, for secure clusters, you can skip this step.
   For new installs done through the 6.0 MapR Installer, the installer
   enables this configuration. For manual installs and upgrades,
   [1]running configure.sh -R, as the final step in the configuration
   process, enables these settings.

   Complete the following step to manually configure authentication on a
   non-secure cluster or in versions earlier than MEP 4.0:
    1. Configure the following property in the spark-defaults.conf file on
       each Spark node:
spark.authenticate true
       The spark-defaults.conf file is in the following location:
       /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/conf/
    2. If you have configured an external shuffle service, you must also
       add the following property to [2]yarn-site.xml on each Spark node:
<property>
      <name>spark.authenticate</name>
      <value>true</value>
</property>
