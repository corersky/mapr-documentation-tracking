Configure SASL Encryption for Spark on YARN

   Note: Starting in MEP 4.0, for secure clusters, you can skip the steps
   outlined in this section. For new installs done through the 6.0 MapR
   Installer, the installer enables this configuration. For manual
   installs and upgrades, [1]running configure.sh -R, as the final step in
   the configuration process, enables these settings.

   Complete the following steps to manually enable SASL encryption on a
   non-secure cluster or in versions earlier than MEP 4.0:
    1. Verify that authentication is enabled, or configure authentication.
       SASL encryption uses the same authentication keys.
       For more information, see [2]Configure Authentication for Spark on
       YARN
    2. Configure the following property in the spark-defaults.conf file on
       each spark node.
spark.authenticate.enableSaslEncryption true
       The spark-defaults.conf file is in the following location:
       /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/conf/
