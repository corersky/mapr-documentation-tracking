Using Spark on YARN

   This section includes information about using Spark on YARN in a MapR
   cluster.

   For a simple test of your Spark installation, run the following command
   as the mapr user:
     * On Spark 2.0.1 or later:
/opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/bin/run-example --master yarn --deploy-mode clie
nt SparkPi 10
     * On Spark 1.6.1:
MASTER=yarn-client /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/bin/run-example org.apache.sp
ark.examples.SparkPi 10

   Note: These commands will fail if it is run as the root user.

   For more information about running Spark applications, see the
   [1]Apache Spark documentation.
