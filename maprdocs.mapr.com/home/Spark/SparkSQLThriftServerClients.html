Spark Thrift Server Clients

   With Spark Thrift server, you can use JDBC and ODBC connection
   interfaces that enable a variety of external tools to access Spark and
   run SQL queries.
     * The ODBC interface is used by BI tools (often produced by MapR
       partners such as [1]Tableau or [2]Microstrategy).
     * The JDBC interface is used by clients such as SQuirrel SQL or the
       Beeline simple SQL shell.

   MapR Hive JDBC clients that connect to HiveServer2 can also connect to
   Spark Thrift server without additional configuration. For details about
   clients, see [3]HiveServer2 Clients and [4]Connecting to HiveServer2.
   Important: Starting in the MEP 4.0 release, if you start and stop the
   Spark Thrift server using Warden, the connection port number is 2304.
   If you start and stop by running the
   /opt/mapr/spark/<spark-version/sbin/{start,stop}-thriftserver.sh
   scripts, the port number is 10000.

MapR-SASL JDBC Connection String Format

   If you start and stop the Spark Thrift server through Warden, starting
   in MEP 4.0, then the JDBC connection string format for MapR-SASL
   environments is:
jdbc:hive2://<hostname>:2304/default;auth=maprsasl

   Otherwise, it is:
jdbc:hive2://<hostname>:10000/default;auth=maprsasl

Kerberos JDBC Connection String Format

   If you start and stop the Spark Thrift server through Warden, starting
   in MEP 4.0, then the JDBC connection string format for clusters secured
   with Kerberos is:
jdbc:hive2://<hostname>:2304/default;principal=mapr/<FQDN@REALM>

   Otherwise, it is:
jdbc:hive2://<hostname>:10000/default;principal=mapr/<FQDN@REALM>
