Configuring Spark Thrift Server Encryption

   Spark Thrift server encryption is supported when authentication is
   enabled.
   Note: Starting in MEP 4.0, for secure clusters, you can skip the steps
   outlined in this section. For new installs done through the 6.0 MapR
   Installer, the installer enables this configuration. For manual
   installs and upgrades, [1]running configure.sh -R enables these
   settings.
   To manually configure encryption with MapR-SASL or Kerberos
   authentication on a non-secure cluster or in versions earlier than MEP
   4.0, complete the following steps:
    1. Set the hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop property in hive-site.xml to
       the value, auth-conf. The SASL Quality of Protection (QOP), or
       sasl.qop, setting and the authentication with confidentiality
       (auth-conf) value support authentication.
<property>
            <name>hive.server2.thrift.sasl.qop</name>
            <value>auth-conf</value>
</property>
    2. Restart Spark Thrift server to apply this change.
       Important: The MapR administrative user (generally, the account
       named mapr) should start Spark Thrift server. Then, process
       identifier (PID) files will be owned by this user, and
       impersonation support (where applicable) will function correctly.
./sbin/stop-thriftserver.sh
./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh
