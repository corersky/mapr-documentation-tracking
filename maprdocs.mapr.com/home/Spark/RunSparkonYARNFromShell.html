Run Spark from the Spark Shell

   In yarn-client mode, complete the following steps to run Spark from the
   Spark shell:
    1. Navigate to the Spark-on-YARN installation directory, and insert
       your Spark version into the command. For example: 2.0.1
cd /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/
    2. Issue the following command to run Spark from the Spark shell:
          + On Spark 2.0.1 and later:
./bin/spark-shell --master yarn --deploy-mode client
          + On Spark 1.6.1:
MASTER=yarn-client ./bin/spark-shell
       Note: You must use yarn-client mode to run Spark from the Spark
       shell. The yarn-cluster mode is not supported.
