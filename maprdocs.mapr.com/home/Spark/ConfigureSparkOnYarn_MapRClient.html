Configure MapR Client Node to Run Spark Applications

   When Spark runs on YARN, MapR client nodes require the
   hadoop-yarn-server-web-proxy JAR file to run Spark applications. On
   Windows, the client node also requires an update to the
   SPARK_DIST_CLASSPATH. A MapR client node (a node with the mapr-client
   package, but without mapr-core packages) is also known as an edge node.

   The mapr-client package does not include the JAR file required to run
   Spark applications. Therefore, you must copy the
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/share/hadoop/yarn/hadoop-yarn-server-web-
   proxy-<version>.jar from a MapR cluster node to the same location on
   the MapR client node from which you want to run the Spark application.
