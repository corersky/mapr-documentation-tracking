Spark JDBC and ODBC Drivers

   MapR provides JDBC and ODBC drivers so you can write SQL queries that
   access the Apache Spark data processing engine. This section provides
   instructions on how to download the drivers, and install and configure
   them.

   You can download the Spark JDBC driver from
   [1]http://package.mapr.com/tools/MapR-JDBC/MapR_Spark/ and the Spark
   ODBC driver from
   [2]http://package.mapr.com/tools/MapR-ODBC/MapR_Spark/.

   After downloading the driver, refer to the documentation at [3]Spark
   JDBC Driver to install and configure the JDBC driver and [4]Spark ODBC
   Driver for the ODBC driver. A copy of the documentation is also
   available in each download package.
   Note: When connecting to the Spark Thrift Server using beeline and the
   JDBC driver, you may encounter the following error:
"Unsupported transaction isolation level: 4"

   To avoid this error, pass the isolation parameter to beeline as
   follows:
bin/beeline --isolation=default
