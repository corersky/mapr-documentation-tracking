Integrate Spark with MapR-ES

   Integrate Spark with MapR Streams to enable Spark to query MapR-ES for
   new messages at a given interval, process any new messages that are
   available, and also publish messages into MapR-ES.

   You can use Spark to access MapR-ES through Sparkâ€™s receiver-less,
   direct approach.

   For more information, see the [1]Apache Spark documentation.
   Note: Before you integrate Spark with MapR-ES, verify that the Streams
   Client is install on all Spark nodes. For more information, see the
   [2]Installing MapR and/or MapR Ecosystem Components.
