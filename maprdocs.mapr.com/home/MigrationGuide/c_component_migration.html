Component Migration

   This section describes how to migrate customized components to MapR
   Hadoop.

   MapR Hadoop features the complete Hadoop distribution including
   components such as Hive. There are a few things to know about migrating
   Hive, or about migrating custom components you have patched yourself.

Custom Components

   If you have applied your own patches to a component and wish to
   continue to use that customized component with the MapR distribution,
   you should keep the following considerations in mind:
     * MapR libraries: All Hadoop components must point to MapR for the
       Hadoop libraries. Change any absolute paths. Do not hardcode
       hdfs:// or maprfs:// into your applications. This is also true of
       Hadoop ecosystem components that are not included in the MapR
       Hadoop distribution (such as Cascading). For more information see
       [1]Working with MapR-FS.
     * Component compatibility: Before you commit to the migration of a
       customized component (for example, customized HBase), check the
       MapR release notes to see if MapR Technologies has issued a patch
       that satisfies your business requirements. MapR Technologies
       publishes a list of Hadoop common patches and MapR patches with
       each release and makes those patches available for our customers to
       take, build, and deploy.
     * ZooKeeper coordination service: Certain components depend on
       ZooKeeper. When you migrate your customized component from the HDFS
       cluster to the MapR cluster, make sure it points correctly to the
       MapR ZooKeeper service.
