Migrating to MapR

   Provides instructions for migrating business-critical data and
   applications from an Apache Hadoop cluster to a MapR cluster.

   This guide provides instructions for migrating business-critical data
   and applications from an Apache Hadoop cluster to a MapR cluster.

   The MapR distribution is 100% API-compatible with Apache Hadoop, and
   migration is a relatively straightforward process. The additional
   features available in MapR provide new ways to interact with your data.
   In particular, MapR provides a fully read/write storage layer that can
   be mounted as a filesystem via NFS, allowing existing processes, legacy
   workflows, and desktop applications full access to the entire cluster.

   Migration consists of planning, deployment, and migration of
   components, applications, data, and nodes.

   up-to-date information about migration issues.
