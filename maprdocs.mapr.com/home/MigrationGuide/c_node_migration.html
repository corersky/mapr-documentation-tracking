Node Migration

   You can add decommissioned HDFS data nodes to your MapR cluster.

   Once you have loaded your data and tested and tuned your applications,
   you can add decommission HDFS data-nodes and add them to the MapR
   cluster.

   This is a three-step process:
     * Decommissioning nodes on an Apache Hadoop cluster: The Hadoop
       decommission feature enables you to gracefully remove a set of
       existing data-nodes from a cluster while it is running, without
       data loss. For more information, see the [1]Hadoop Wiki FAQ.
     * Meeting minimum hardware and software requirements: Ensure that
       every data-node you want to add to the MapR cluster meets the
       hardware, software, and configuration [2]requirements.
     * Adding Nodes to a MapR cluster: You can add those data-nodes to the
       MapR cluster. For more information, see [3]Adding Nodes to a
       Cluster.
