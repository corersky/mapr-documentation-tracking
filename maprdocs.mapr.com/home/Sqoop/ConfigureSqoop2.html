Configuring Sqoop2

   This section provides information about configuring Sqoop2 with MapR,
   but it does not duplicate Apache documentation.

   Starting with the MEP 4.0 release, for secure clusters, Sqoop2 is
   configured to enable MapR-SASL and SSL. Prior to the MEP 4.0 release,
   by default, Sqoop2 is not configured with any type of security or
   encryption.

   For additional configuration details, see the [1]Apache Sqoop website.
