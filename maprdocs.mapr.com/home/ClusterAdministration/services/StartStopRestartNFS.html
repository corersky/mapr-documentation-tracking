   NFSv3 Server
          The command to stop, start, or restart MapR NFSv3 server is:

maprcli node services -nodes <node names> -nfs stop|start|restart

          For complete reference, see [4]node services.

   Note: When NFS server is stopped, the VIPs associated with the server
   are released and CLDB attempts to reassign the VIPs to other available
   NFS servers.
