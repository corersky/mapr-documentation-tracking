Viewing Drill Information

   You can view information on Drill using MCS.

Viewing Drill Information Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and click Services.
    2. Click on Drill in the Services pane.
       The Drill information page displays the following:
          + [1]Summary
          + [2]Drill Bits
       The Summary tab displays the following panes:

   Information Displays the number of Drillbits and the number of
   completed and in-progress queries.
   Resource Utilization The percentage of CPU, memory, and disk space
   utilized by Drill.
   Running Fragments The number of query fragments running in the Drillbit
   during the selected date and time range. You can select a preset (last
   15 minutes, last 1 hour, last 12 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days, last
   90 days) or custom time range and zoom in (by clicking and dragging
   your mouse in the pane) for a more granular view.

   For more information on fragments, see [3]Drill Query Execution.
   Memory Used The amount of direct memory used by the JVM during the
   selected date and time range. You can select a preset (last 15 minutes,
   last 1 hour, last 12 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days, last 90 days) or
   custom time range and zoom in (by clicking and dragging your mouse in
   the pane) for a more granular view.

   To configure the amount of direct memory allocated to a Drillbit for
   query processing in a Drill cluster, see [4]Configuring Drill Memory.
   Queries The number of queries during the selected time range. You can
   select a preset (last 15 minutes, last 1 hour, last 12 hours, last 7
   days, last 30 days, last 90 days) or custom time range and zoom in (by
   clicking and dragging your mouse in the pane) for a more granular view.
       Note: The metrics collection infrastructure must be installed
       during installation to visualize the metrics in the various panes.
       If the metrics collection infrastructure is not installed, perform
       an [5]Incremental Install to install the metrics collection
       infrastructure.
       The Drill Bits tab displays the list of Drillbits. See [6]Viewing
       the List of Drillbits.
