Viewing Node Metrics

   You can view node metrics through the MapR Control System.
   Note: The metrics collection infrastructure must be installed during
   installation to visualize the metrics in the various panes. If the
   metrics collection infrastructure is not installed, perform an
   [1]Incremental Install to visualize the metrics described below.

Monitoring Node Metrics Using MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Metrics tab in the [2]node information
   page.
   CPU Shows the amount of CPU time used by:
     * Processes with a positive nice value
     * User processes
     * System processes

   Also shows amount of CPU time spent:
     * Idle
     * Waiting for I/O operations

   Memory Shows the amount of used and available memory on the node.
   Network I/O Shows the number of bytes received and bytes sent.
   Swap Shows the amount of used and available swap space on the node.
   System Disk IOPS Shows the number of disk read and write operations on
   the node.
   System Disk Throughput Shows the amount of time to process disk reads
   and writes in kilobytes.
   MFS IOPS Shows the number of MFS read and write operations.
   MFS Throughput Shows the amount of time to process reads and writes
   from MFS in kilobytes.

   You can view metrics for a custom or specific time period (last 15
   minutes, last 1 hour, last 12 hours, last 24 hours, last 7 days, last
   30 days, or last 90 days) and click and drag the mouse in the chart to
   zoom in and view metrics at a granular level.
