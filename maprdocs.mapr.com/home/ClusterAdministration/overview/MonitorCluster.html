Monitoring the Cluster

   You can view the cluster health, disk, memory, CPU utilization metrics,
   and alarms on the cluster using MCS and the CLI.

Monitoring Cluster Health Using the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and click Overview.

   The Overview page displays the following panes:
     * [1]Node Health — the health of the nodes on the cluster, by service
       (default) or topology
     * [2]Active Alarms — a summary of active alarms for the cluster
     * [3]Cluster Utilization — CPU, memory, and disk space usage
     * [4]Yarn — the number of running and queued applications, number of
       Node Managers, and percent of memory and CPU's used relative to the
       amount configured
     * [5]Volume Data — the number of mounted and unmounted volumes on the
       cluster

   Note: During installation using the MapR Installer, you can configure
   metrics and logging using settings on the Monitoring page of the MapR
   Installer user interface. The metrics collection infrastructure must be
   installed because the MapR Control System relies on these metrics to
   provide graphs and charts in the panes. If the metrics collection
   infrastructure is not installed, you cannot visualize the metrics in
   the various panes. If you want, you can install metrics collection or
   logging by selecting the feature during an [6]Incremental Install.

Viewing Cluster Utilization Information in the MapR Control System

   The Cluster Utilization pane in the Overview page displays the
   following for:
     * CPU — Percentage of cores currently utilized and total cores
     * Memory — Percentage of memory (in GB) currently utlized and total
       memory (in GB)
     * Disk — Percentage of space (in GB) currently utilized and total
       disk space (in GB)

   The Cluster Utilization pane also shows the amount of raw data and the
   savings (in percentage) after compression.

   The Utilization Trend pane shows CPU, memory, and disk usage trend for
   the specified time range. To view utilization trend for a time range,
   you can either choose the time range from the dropdown menu (which can
   be for the last 15 minutes, last hour, last 12 hours, last day, last 7
   days, last 30 days, or last 90 days) or select a custom time range, and
   zoom in (by clicking and dragging the cursor in the pane) for a more
   granular view. Click Reset Zoom to zoom out and return to selected
   date/time range view. If there were any alarms during the selected
   date/time range, the Alarms pane above shows:
     * When the alarm was raised
     * The severity of the alarm
          + [severeAlarm.png] — an error
          + [warningAlarm.png] — a warning
          + [infoAlarm.png] — information

Monitoring Cluster Alarms in the MapR Control System

   See [7]Viewing Active Cluster Alarms for more information.

Retrieving Cluster Information Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to retrieve cluster health and disk space information
   is:
maprcli dashboard info -cluster <cluster>

   The utilization field in the output shows the total and utilized amount
   of disk space, memory, and CPU for the cluster, which can also be
   visualized in MCS. For example:
# /opt/mapr/bin/maprcli dashboard info -json
{
        "timestamp":1525230746268,
        "timeofday":"2018-05-01 08:12:26.268 GMT-0700 PM",
        "status":"OK",
        "total":1,
        "data":[
                {
                        ...
                        "utilization":{
                                "cpu":{
                                        "util":7,
                                        "total":8,
                                        "active":0
                                },
                                "memory":{
                                        "total":15886,
                                        "active":11281
                                },
                                "disk_space":{
                                        "total":273,
                                        "active":0
                                },
                                "compression":{
                                        "compressed":0,
                                        "uncompressed":0
                                }
                        },
                        ...
                }
        ]
}
