Monitoring Volumes

   You can monitor volume:
     * [1]Mount information
     * [2]Disk usage
     * [3]Alarms
     * [4]Metrics

Monitoring Volume Disk Usage Using the MapR Control System

   You can view:
     * Volumes that use the most amount of allocated disk space in the Top
       Volume Utilization pane under Data > Volumes.
     * Disk usage trend for a volume in the Usage Trends pane in the
       Summary tab of the [5]volume information page. You can select a
       preset (last 15 minutes, last 1 hour, last 12 hours, last 7 days,
       last 30 days, or last 90 days) or custom time range and zoom in (by
       clicking and dragging the cursor in the pane) for a more granular
       view. If necessary, click Reset Zoom to return to the default view.

   Note: The metrics collection infrastructure must be installed during
   installation to visualize the metrics in the various panes. If the
   metrics collection infrastructure is not installed, perform an
   [6]Incremental Install to view the charts described here.

Monitoring Volume Alarms in the MapR Control System

   See [7]Viewing Active Volume Alarms.

Viewing Volume Mount Information in the MapR Control System

   You can view the number of mounted and unmounted volumes on the cluster
   in the Volumes pane under Overview. The pane displays:
     * The total number of volumes on the cluster
     * The number of mounted and unmounted volumes
     * The percentage of volumes mounted

Visualizing Volume Metrics

   MapR provides Volume dashboard that displays various volume metrics
   including raw data size, snapshot size, total size (including the
   snapshot size), and volume utilization trends. For more information,
   see [8]Sample Dashboards in Grafana. In addition, if the volume metric
   collection feature is enabled on MFS as described in [9]Enabling Volume
   Metric Collection, you can also visualize the following metrics for the
   volume: number of IOs, throughput, and latency. For more information,
   see [10]Collecting Volume Metrics.
