Managing the Cluster

   You can add licenses, set up auditing of cluster administration,
   configure disk space balancer tool settings and Role Balancer settings,
   configure how MapReduce porgrams run, allocate quotas for users and
   groups and set cluster reserve limit, and generate DNS Gateway record
   for table replication using the MapR Control System (click Admin >
   Cluster Settings) and the CLI.
