Enabling and Disabling Auditing of Data Access Operations

   You can enable or disable auditing of data-access operations using MCS
   and the CLI. See [1]Auditing Data Access Operations for the complete
   list of data-access operations that can be audited.

Enabling and Disabling Auditing of Data Access Operations Using MCS

   To enable or disable auditing of data-access operations on a cluster:
    1. Log in to MapR Control System and click Admin > Cluster Settings >
       Auditing.
    2. Set the following:

   Enabled Move the slider to Yes to enable or toNo to disable data
   auditing.
   Maximum Size Set the size in GB, which when reached causes an alarm to
   be sent to the dashboard in MCS. The alarm is to notify the cluster
   administrator that the audit log size is large enough that the
   administrator might want to take action. The audit log continues to
   grow until the administrator takes action or until the retention period
   ends.
   Retain Logs for Set the period of time in days to keep the data in the
   audit log. After this period elapses, the content of the file is
   deleted and new entries are added to the file until the retention
   period elapses.
    3. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.
       This action does not cause auditing to start for operations within
       the volumes. It only sets a flag that says you allow auditing of
       individual volumes to be enabled when volume is created or
       modified.

Enabling and Disabling Auditing of Data Access Operations Using the CLI or
REST API

    1. To enable or disable auditing of filesystem, table, and streams
       operations on a cluster, run the [2]maprcli audit data command.
       This command does not cause auditing to start for operations within
       those volumes. It only sets a flag that says you allow auditing of
       individual volumes to be enabled with the [3]maprcli volume audit
       command. The audit logs for file operations, table operations, and
       stream operations are affected by the value that you set for the
       -retention parameter.
    2. To enable or disable auditing for a particular volume, run the
       [4]maprcli volume audit command. To verify that auditing is enabled
       for a volume, run the [5]maprcli volume info command.
       You can grep with the search term 'audited\|coalesce'.
maprcli volume info -name <volume_name> -json | grep -i 'audited\|coalesce'
       The output of the command should look like this, with a 1 for the
       audited key and the value for the coalesceinterval key:
       "audited":1, "coalesceInterval":2
    3. To enable or disable auditing for a particular directory, file,
       MapR-DB table, or streams that existed in a volume at the time that
       you ran the [6]maprcli volume audit command, run the [7]hadoop mfs
       command with the -setaudit parameter.
hadoop mfs -setaudit <on|off> <directory|file|table>
       Note: Wildcards are not supported for the names of filesystem
       objects in this command.
       Enabling auditing on a directory does not enable auditing on the
       files that already exist in the directory, though new files and
       directories created in the directory will have auditing enabled.
       For example, if you run this command on the root directory of a
       volume, all new files, directories, and tables that are
       subsequently created in the volume are audited. The creation of
       those objects is also audited.

   After enabling auditing, if you create a:
     * Snapshot of a volume, the snapshot inherits the audit settings of
       the original volume.
     * Local mirror or remote mirror of a volume, you must run the
       [8]maprcli volume audit command to enable auditing on the mirror
       volume. Auditing for particular directories, files, and MapR-DB
       tables in a mirror volume is enabled automatically if auditing is
       enabled for them in the source volume.
