Adding a License

   You can add a license through the MapR Control System and using the
   CLI.

Adding a License Using the MapR Control System

   Complete the following steps to add a license using the MapR Control
   System:
    1. On a machine that is connected to the cluster and to the Internet,
       perform the following steps to open the MapR Control System:
         a. In a browser, view the MapR Control System by navigating to
            the node that is running the MapR Control System:
            https:/<webserver>/:8443.
            Your computer won't have an HTTPS certificate yet, so the
            browser will warn you that the connection is not trustworthy.
            You can ignore the warning this time.
         b. Log in to the MapR Control System as the administrative user
            you designated earlier.
            Until a license is applied, the MapR Control System dashboard
            might show some nodes in the amber "degraded" state. Don't
            worry if not all nodes are green and "healthy" at this stage.
    2. In the MapR Control System, go to Admin > Cluster Settings >
       Licenses.
    3. Add a license using the following options:

   Import License Allows you to import a license from the server. You must
   enter your credentials in the Import License window to retrieve your
   license information.
   Upload License Allows you to upload your license file via browser.
   Cut/Paste License Allows you to copy and paste license key in the Copy
   and Paste License window.
   Get a Free Trial License Navigates to the MapR licensing form online to
   get a trial license.
    4. Click Submit.
       If the cluster is already registered, the license is applied
       automatically. Otherwise, go to MapR.com and follow the
       instructions there to register the cluster.

Adding a License Using the CLI or the REST API

   To add a license from the CLI:
    1. Obtain a valid license file from MapR.
    2. Copy the license file to a cluster node.
    3. Run the following command to add the license:
maprcli license add [ -cluster <name> ] -license <filename> -is_file true
       See [1]license add for complete reference information.
