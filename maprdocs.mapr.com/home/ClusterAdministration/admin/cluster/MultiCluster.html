Managing Another Unsecure Cluster Using MCS

   When logged into the MapR Control System of a cluster, you can go to
   the MapR Control System on another unsecure cluster. To navigate to the
   MCS on another unsecure cluster:
   Select the name of the cluster to go to from the dropdown list
   associated with the name of the cluster you are logged into.
   After a few minutes, the MCS login page for the other cluster displays.
