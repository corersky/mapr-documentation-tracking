Configuring Bin Size

   The number of bins used by the disk balancer is not constant and is
   determined by the sizes of different bins. You can configure the size
   of each of the bins (Below Average, Average, Above Average, and
   Overused) individually at run time. The larger the size of the bins,
   the greater the chance that two SPs that are in the vicinity of each
   other with respect to utilization fall in the same bin.

   The default size of overused bins is only 3%, because SPs in this bin
   must be balanced at a finer granularity. The default size of above
   average, average, and below average bins is 20%. You can aggressively
   balance the storage pools across bins by reducing the size of each bin,
   forcing the SPs to fall into different bins. To reduce the size of each
   bin, specify the value for the following parameters using the maprcli
   config save command:
   Parameter Description
   dbal.above.avg.bin.size Specifies the bin size (%) of SPs whose usage
   is above the cluster average. The default is 20%.
   dbal.avg.bin.size Specifies the bin size (%) of SPs whose usage is in
   the average range. The default is 20%.
   dbal.below.avg.bin.size Specifies the bin size (%) of SPs whose usage
   is below the cluster average. The default is 20%.
   dbal.overused.bin.size Specifies the bin size (%) of SPs whose usage is
   in the overused range. The default is 3%.

   For example, to reduce the size of the Below Average bin to 10%, run
   the following command:
maprcli config save -values {"dbal.below.avg.bin.size":"10"}
