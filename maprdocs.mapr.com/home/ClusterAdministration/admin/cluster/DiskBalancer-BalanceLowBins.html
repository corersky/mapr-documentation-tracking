Balancing Average and Below Average Bins

   Although the chief utility of the disk balancer is to balance highly
   utilized storage pools in Overused and Above Average bins, the disk
   balancer balances storage pools that are less utilized, for example, to
   distribute workload evenly across the nodes or if a new node is added
   to the topology to add more storage. By default, the disk balancer
   performs this kind of balancing less frequently than the balancing of
   disk space utilization.

   The disk balancer balances storage pools in Average and Below Average
   bins every 6 hours by default. You can configure the interval by the
   setting the value (in minutes) for the parameter
   dbal.below.avg.bins.balancing.frequency using the marpcli config save
   command. For example:
maprcli config save -values {"dbal.below.avg.bins.balancing.frequency":"360"}

   Note: The disk balancer considers storage pools in these two bins only:
    1. When there is not already too much SP balancing activity in the
       highly utilized bins.
    2. If container movement out of SPs in the highly utilized bins is not
       possible.
