Retrieving Role Balancer Status Using the CLI

   You can use the [1]maprcli dump rolebalancerinfo command to see the
   number of active replication role switches. During a replication role
   switch, the replication role balancer selects a master or intermediate
   data container and switches its replication role to that of a tail data
   container.
   Example:
# maprcli dump rolebalancerinfo -json
{
    "timestamp":1335835436698,
    "status":"OK",
    "total":1,
    "data":[
             {
                "containerid": 36659,
                "Tail IP:Port":"10.50.60.123:5660-",
                "Updates blocked Since":"Wed May 23 05:48:15 PDT 2012"
             }

    ]
}
