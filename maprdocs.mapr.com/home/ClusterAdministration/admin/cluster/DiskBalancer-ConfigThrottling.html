Configuring Throttling

   Although balancing storage pool disk space use is important, it
   requires network, computation, and disk bandwidth that must be shared
   with other functions. Hence, the number of container moves at any point
   of time is throttled. By default, the maximum number of container moves
   is 10% of the number of nodes in the cluster. However, you can
   configure the throttling factor (percentage) by setting the parameter
   cldb.balancer.disk.max.switches.in.nodes.percentage using the maprcli
   command.

   For example, to reset the throttling factor to 12% of the number of
   nodes in the cluster, run the following command:
maprcli config save -values {"cldb.balancer.disk.max.switches.in.nodes.percentag
e":"12"}
