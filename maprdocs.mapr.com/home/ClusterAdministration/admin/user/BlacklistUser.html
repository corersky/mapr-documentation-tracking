Blacklisting Users Using the CLI

   You can blacklist users using the CLI. When a user is blacklisted, all
   existing tickets for the user are canceled and any request sent by the
   user that has a ticket older than the blacklist's timestamp is
   rejected. For more information, see [1]How Tickets Work.

Blacklisting Users Using the CLI or REST API
