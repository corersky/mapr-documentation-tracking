Setting the Refresh Rate in the MapR Control System

   You can configure how frequently you want to refresh the graphs and
   data in the panes. To set refresh rate:
    1. Log in to MCS and click [colRefresh.png] to display the Refresh
       Rate window.
    2. Log in to MCS and click Settings from the [userIcon.png] dropdown
       menu.
    3. Enter the refresh rate in seconds.
       In v6.0, the minimum refresh interval rate is 5 seconds and by
       default, graphs are refreshed every 15 seconds. In v6.0.1, the
       minimum and default refresh interval rate is 30 seconds.
    4. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.
