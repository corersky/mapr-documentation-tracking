Modifying Multiple Volumes

   You can modify volumes using MCS and the CLI.

Modifying Volumes Using the MapR Control System

   To edit multiple volumes, in the Summary tab under Data > Volumes:
    1. Select the volumes to edit in the Volumes pane and click Edit
       Volume(s) from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Edit Volumes page displays. You can edit certain volume
       properties, authorization settings, usage settings, and schedule
       settings for the selected volumes.
    2. Modify one or more of the following settings.
       Note: If the selected volumes share the same settings, the fields
       are pre-populated with the current value. If the selected volumes
       contain different settings, only the fields that have been set in
       all the selected volumes display.

        Properties

   SETTINGS Accountable Entity The entity accountable for this volumeâ€™s
   usage.
   AUDITING Enable Auditing Specifies whether auditing of operations on
   directories, files, and tables in the volumes is enabled.
   Coalesce Interval Interval of time used when logging multiple instance
   of an operation on a node from a client IP, if auditing is enabled.
   REPLICATION Replication Desired and minimum number of copies of the
   volumes.
   Name Container Replication Desired and minimum number of copies of the
   name container associated with the volumes.

        Authorization

   ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS Users and groups that have permissions to
   perform administrative operations on this volume.

        Usage

   Volume Advisory Quota Allocated disk space, which when exceeded raises
   an alarm but does not prevent writes.
   Volume Hard Quota Allocated disk space, which when exceeded prevents
   further writes.

        Schedule

   Snapshot Schedule Schedule for creating snapshots of this volume.
   Mirror Schedule Schedule for running mirroring operation for the
   volumes.

   Note: This is available only if all the selected volumes are mirror
   volumes.

       Note: To undo a change to a specific setting, click the associated
       [revertChange.png] . This action will revert the value to the
       current setting.
    3. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

Modifying Volumes Using the CLI or REST API
