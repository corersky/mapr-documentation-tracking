       Accountable Entities pane.

    3. Verify the list of users/groups and modify or set the following for
       the users/groups:
         a. Hard quota, which raises an alarm when the limit is reached
            and prevents further writes.
         b. Advisory quota, which raises an alarm when the threshold is
            reached, but does not prevent further writes.
       Note: Both, advisory and hard, quotas can be expressed in megabytes
       (MB), which is the default, gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB).
