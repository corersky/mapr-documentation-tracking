Preserving one or more Snapshots

   You can preserve a snapshot using the [1]volume snapshot preserve
   command, or you can preserve snapshots using the MapR Control System.

Preserving Snapshots Using the MapR Control System

   You can preserve a snapshot to prevent it from expiring. To preserve
   one or more snapshots, in the Snapshots tab (under Data > Volumes):
    1. Select the snapshot(s) you want to preserve.
    2. Click Preserve Snapshot to preserve the snapshot(s).
       The Preserve Snapshot(s) confirmation dialog displays.
    3. Verify the list of snapshots to preserve and click Preserve
       Snapshots.
       The Expires On column for the selected snapshots will show No
       Expiration. You cannot set an expiration date for a preserved
       snapshot; instead, if necessary, remove the preserved snapshot.

Preserving Snapshots Associated with a Volume Using the MapR Control System

   You can preserve a snapshot to prevent it from expiring. To preserve
   one or more snapshots (and prevent them from expiring) associated with
   a volume:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Snapshots tab in the [2]volume
       information page.
       The list of snapshots associated with the volume displays.
    2. Select the snapshots to preserve and click Preserve Snapshot.
       The Preserve Snapshot(s) confirmation dialog displays.
    3. Verify the list of snapshots to preserve and click Preserve
       Snapshots.
       The Expires On column for the selected snapshots will show No
       Expiration. You cannot set an expiration date for a preserved
       snapshot; instead, if necessary, remove the preserved snapshot.

Preserving Snapshots Using the CLI or the REST API

   The basic command to preserve the snapshots is:
maprcli volume snapshot preserve

   For complete reference information, see [3]volume snapshot preserve.
