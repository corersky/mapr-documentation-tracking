Setting Quota for a Volume

   You can set quotas for a volume using MCS and the CLI.

Setting Quota for a Volume Using the MapR Control System

   To set volume quotas, in the Summary tab under Data > Volumes:
    1. Ensure that the Usage column is displayed in the Volumes pane.
       If necessary, customize the columns to see the Usage column.
    2. Click the Set Quota link associated with the volume for which you
       want to set quotas.
       The Set Quota dialog displays.
    3. Specify the following:
         a. Hard quota, which raises an alarm when the threshold is
            reached and prevents further writes.
         b. Advisory quota, which raises an alarm when the threshold is
            reached, but does not prevent further writes.
       Note: Both, advisory and hard, quotas can be expressed in megabytes
       (MB), gigabytes (GB), which is the default, or terabytes (TB).
       Advisory quota cannot be greater than hard quota.
    4. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

 <quota>
