Changing Volume Type

   You can convert a standard volume to a mirror volume and promote a
   mirror volume to a standard volume.

   A standard volume with one or more associated mirror volumes can be
   converted to a mirror volume that mirrors one of the its associated
   mirror volumes. The mirror volume that the converted standard volume is
   set to mirror must then be promoted to a standard volume. The converted
   standard volume then becomes a read-only copy of the promoted mirror
   volume.
   Note: Standard volumes that do not have one or more associated mirror
   volumes cannot be converted to mirror volumes.

   A mirror volume is a read-only physical copy of a standard volume. In
   general, mirror volumes are created for the purpose of preventing or
   minimizing data loss. Mirror volumes are also used to improve
   performance or to make copies of data for use in other clusters without
   impacting production. Mirror volumes can be changed to read-write
   volumes by converting the mirror volumes to standard volumes.

   The following topics include procedures for converting a standard
   volume to a mirror volume and vice versa.
