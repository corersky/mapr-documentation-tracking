Filtering the List of Volumes

   The filter lets you build search expressions to provide sophisticated
   filtering capabilities for locating specific data on views that display
   a large number of volumes. Expressions are implicitly connected by the
   AND operator.

Filtering the List in the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and click Data > Volumes to filter volumes in the
       Volumes pane.
    2. Click [filterMenu.png] and and select one of the following from the
       Add Filter dropdown menu:
          + Volume — to filter the list by volume name
          + Mount Path — to filter the list by mount path
          + Creator — to filter the list by entity or volume owner
          + Total Size — to filter the list by size of volume
          + Usage — to filter the list by amount of disk used
          + Replication Factor — to filter the list by replication factor
          + Physical Toplogy — to filter by the rack path
          + Quota — to filter by hard quota
    3. Specify the value in the dropdown field for the selected filter (to
       filter the list of volumes by) and click Filter.
       As you make selections and specify the filtering criteria, the pane
       displays only the volumes that match the specified filtering
       criteria.
    4. Click:
          + Add Filter to add another filtering criteria.
          + [removeSelection.png] to remove a filtering criteria.
          + [deleteFilters.png] to clear all filter settings.

Filtering the List Using the CLI

   The [1]volume list command can be used with the -filter option, which
   let you specify large numbers of volumes by matching specified values
   in specified fields rather than by typing each name explicitly. For
   example, you can display all volumes whose owner is root and whose name
   begins with test as follows:
maprcli volume list -filter [n=="test*"]and[on=="root"]
