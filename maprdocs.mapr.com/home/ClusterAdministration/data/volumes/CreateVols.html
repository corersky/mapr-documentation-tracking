Creating a Volume

   You can create a new (Standard or Mirror) volume using MCS and/or the
   CLI.

Creating a Volume Using the MapR Control System

   To create a new (Standard or Mirror) volume using MCS:
    1. Go to Data > Volumes and click Create Volume.
       The Create New Volume page displays.
    2. Select the Volume Type under SETTINGS in the Properties tab.
       Choose:
          + Standard Volume to create a read-write volume.
          + Mirror Volume to create a volume that is a read-only copy of a
            source volume.
            Tip: See also: [1]Mirror Types.
    3. Specify the following required settings in the Properties tab:
          + [2]Standard Volume
          + [3]Mirror Volume

   Volume Name Enter a name for the volume. A volume name can include
   alphanumeric characters and the following characters: . (dot), _
   (underscore), and - (dash).

   Note: Do not begin the volume name with mapr. as mapr. is used for
   system volumes. If you use mapr. at the start of the volume name, the
   volume may not display in the default view of the list of volumes in
   MCS; you must select the Include System Volumes checkbox in the Volumes
   pane to view volumes with names beginning with mapr..
   Accountable Entity Select the type, user or group, of accountable
   entity and enter the name of the entity in the associated text field.
       Steps 4 to 7 are optional and allow you to define optional volume
       properties (for auditing and replication), volume access, volume
       quota, and volume (snapshot and/or mirror) schedule. If these are
       not defined, default values, where available, are used. You can
       skip to step 8 to create a standard volume with basic settings.

   Volume Name Enter a name for the volume. A volume name can include
   alphanumeric characters and the following characters: . (dot), _
   (underscore), and - (dash).

   Note: Do not begin the volume name with mapr. as mapr. is used for
   system volumes. If you use mapr. at the start of the volume name, the
   volume may not display in the default view of the list of volumes in
   MCS; you must select the Include System Volumes checkbox in the Volumes
   pane to view volumes with names beginning with mapr..
   Source Volume Cluster Enter the name of the cluster on which the source
   volume exists. Mirroring only works between two secure clusters or
   between two non-secure clusters. Mirroring does not work when one
   cluster is secure and the other is non-secure.

   Note: When setting up mirror volumes for mirroring between clusters,
   for the mirroring operation to run successfully, servers in one cluster
   cannot use the same IP addresses as servers in the other cluster. For
   example, if node A in cluster A has a private IP address of
   10.10.20.29, no server in cluster B can have the same private IP
   address. Also, all the servers in destination cluster must be able to
   reach all the servers in the source cluster and vice versa. For
   example, suppose 10.10.20.29 is the only IP address used by node A in
   cluster A; then all servers in cluster B should be able to reach the IP
   address 10.10.20.29.
   Source Volume Name Enter the name of the source volume, from which the
   mirror volume pulls data, (after selecting the source volume cluster).
   If the source volume is on:
          + Same cluster, you will create a local mirror volume, which is
            useful for load balancing or for providing a read-only copy of
            a data set. See [4]Local Mirroring for more information.
          + Another cluster, you will create a remote mirror volume, which
            is useful for offsite backup, for data transfer to remote
            facilities, and for load and latency balancing. See
            [5]Creating Remote Mirrors for more information.

   For information on setting up mirror cascades, see [6]Mirror Cascades.
   Accountable Entity Select the type, user or group, of accountable
   entity and enter the name of the entity in the associated text field.
       Steps 4 to 6 are optional and allow you to define optional volume
       properties (for auditing and replication), volume access, and
       volume quota. If these are not defined, default values, where
       available, will be applied. You can skip to:
          + (Optional) Step 7 to associate a mirroring schedule or a
            snapshot schedule with the mirror volume.
            The mirroring schedule specifies how often to run the
            mirroring operation, which copies data (that has changed at
            the file-block level since the last data transfer) directly
            from the source, even if the files in the source volume are
            being written to or deleted.
            The snapshot schedule specifies how often to take a snapshot
            of the mirror volume for the purpose of preserving the state
            of the mirror before a subsequent mirroring operation.
          + Step 8 to create a mirror volume with basic settings.
    4. (Optional) Specify the following in the Properties tab:
          + [7]Standard Volume
          + [8]Mirror Volume

   SETTINGS Volume Access Specify whether volume is read-only or
   read/write volume. Data on a read-only volume can only be read and data
   can both be read from and written to a read/write volume. By default,
   volume is created with read/write access.
   Mount Specify whether to automatically mount (Yes) or not mount (No)
   the volume after creation. By default, volumes are mounted immediately
   after creation.

   Note: If the mount point is specified while creating a volume, new
   volumes can inherit properties from the parent volume.
   Mount Path Specify the path to mount the volume. This is required if
   the value for Mount is Yes.

   Note: The path must be relative to / and cannot be in the form of a
   global namespace path (for example, /mapr/<cluster-name>/).
   Wire Encryption Specify whether (Yes) or not (No) to encrypt data in
   the volume during transmission. This setting has no effect in a
   non-secure cluster.
   Topology Select the rack path to the volume. The default topology is
   /data.
   AUDITING Audit Specify whether to enable (Yes) or disable (No) auditing
   of volume.

   Note: When you create a snapshot of the volume, the snapshot will
   inherit the audit settings of this volume.
   Coalesce Interval Specify the interval of time (in minutes) to use for
   logging multiple READ, WRITE, or GETATTR operations on one file from
   one client IP address, if auditing is enabled. The default value is 60
   minutes.
   REPLICATION Replication Specify the minimum (Min Target) and desired
   (Max Target) number of copies for the volume data. The default minimum
   is 2 and the default maximum is 3.
   Name Container Replication Specify the minimum (Min Target) and desired
   (Max Target) number of copies for the name container associated with
   the volume. The default minimum is 2 and the default maximum is 3.
   Guarantee Min Replication (Available from v6.0.1) Specify whether (Yes)
   or not (No) to enforce minimum number of copies. If this is enabled
   (Yes), writes succeed only when the minimum number of copies exist.

   For more information, see [9]Understanding Replication.
   Optimize Replication Specify the basis for the replication factor:
          + High throughput, or cascading replication, where volumes are
            replicated sequentially on intermediate and tail containers.
          + Low latency, or star replication, where volumes are replicated
            on multiple containers in parallel.

   The default value is high throughput. See [10]Selecting a Replication
   Type for High Availability.

   SETTINGS Mount Specify whether to automatically mount (Yes) or not
   mount (No) the volume after creation. By default, volumes are mounted
   immediately after creation.
   Mount Path Specify the path to mount the volume. This is required if
   the value for Mount is Yes.

   Note: The path must be relative to / and cannot be in the form of a
   global namespace path (for example, /mapr/<cluster-name>/).
   Wire Encryption Specify whether (Yes) or not (No) to encrypt data in
   the volume during transmission. This setting has no effect in a
   non-secure cluster.
   Topology Select the rack path to the volume. The default topology is
   /data.
   AUDITING Audit Specify whether to enable (Yes) or disable (No) auditing
   of volume.

   Note: Auditing for particular directories, files, and MapR-DB tables in
   the mirror volume is enabled automatically if auditing is enabled for
   them in the source volume.
   Coalesce Interval Specify the interval of time (in minutes) to use when
   logging multiple READ, WRITE, or GETATTR operations on one file from
   one client IP address, if auditing is enabled. The default value is 60
   minutes.
   REPLICATION Replication Specify the minimum (Minimum Replication) and
   desired (Replication) number of copies for the volume data. The default
   minimum is 2 and the default target is 3.
   Name Container Replication Specify the minimum and desired number of
   copies for the name container associated with the volume. The default
   minimum is 2 and the default replication factor is 3.
   Guarantee Min Replication (Available from v6.0.1) Specify whether (Yes)
   or not (No) to enforce minimum number of copies. If this is enabled
   (Yes), writes succeed only when the minimum number of copies exist.

   For more information, see [11]Understanding Replication.
   Optimize Replication Specify the basis for the replication factor:
          + High throughput, or cascading replication, where volumes are
            replicated sequentially on intermediate and tail containers.
          + Low latency, or star replication, where volumes are replicated
            on multiple containers in parallel.

   The default value is high throughput. See [12]Selecting a Replication
   Type for High Availability.
    5. (Optional) Specify the following volume (administrative and user)
       access control settings in the Authorization tab:

   ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS The users and/or groups that have one or more
   of the following permissions:

        Dump & Backup
                Transport large amount of data or copies of the volume on
                physical media to a remote cluster using backup files.

        Restore & Mirror
                Restore a volume from a dump file and create mirror
                volumes, which is a read-only copy of the source volume.

        Edit
                Edit volume properties, create and delete snapshots.

        Delete
                Delete the volume.

        Admin
                View and edit access control settings (but cannot perform
                volume operations).

        Full Control
                Perform all volume-related administrative operations
                except changing access control settings.

   To define administrative access control settings for another user or
   group, click Add Another button.

   Note: To perform this action from the command line, refer to [13]acl
   set.
   By default, the root user and the volume creator have full control
   permissions on the volume.

        Root Directory Permission
                Set read, write, and/or execute permissons on the root
                directory for users, groups and others.

   USER ACCESS CONTROLS SThe users, groups, and/or roles that have and/or
   do not have access to read and/or write to the volume.

   To grant or block access to users, groups, and/or roles, from the:
          + Basic settings, select the type — public, (OR) user, group, or
            role — from the drop-down menu, specify the name of the user,
            group, or role, and select one or more checkbox to grant
            permissions.
            Tip: Click [cloneACE.png] to create a copy of the associated
            access control setting. Click [deleteRow.png] to remove the
            associated access control expression.
            To add access control expressions for another user, group, or
            role, click Add Another and repeat this step.
          + Advanced settings, or specify public (p) or user (u), group
            (g), and/or role (r) who have and/or do not have the type of
            access using the following boolean expressions and
            subexpressions:
               o ! — Negation operator.
               o & — AND operation.
               o | — OR operation.
            Use (), parentheses, for subexpressions.
            Note: You cannot specify user, group, or role individually if
            access is granted to all users (public).
            Alternatively, click [editPencil.png] associated with the type
            of access to use the Access Control Expression window to
            define access for public or users, group, and/or role. See
            [14]Defining ACEs for more information.

   Note: If you switch from Basic to Advanced, the basic settings, if any,
   will be carried over to the advanced settings. If you switch from
   Advanced to Basic, all the settings will be lost because the
   subexpressions and AND (&) and negation (!) operations that are
   supported by advanced settings are not supported in the basic settings.
   By default, access is granted to all users (public). If access is
   granted to all users (public), access cannot also be granted
   individually to users, groups, and/or roles.
    6. Define the amount of disk space (optional) in megabytes (MB),
       gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB) to allocate to the volume in the
       Usage tab:
       By default, there is no limit on the disk space.
       Warning: If the quota set for the mirror volume is less than the
       quota set for its source volume, the CLDB raises an alarm. The
       mirroring operation will not fail, but you must decide whether to
       add space and increase the mirror volume quota, or remove unwanted
       space from the source volume and decrease its quota.

   Advisory Quota The limit, which when reached, an alarm is raised.
   Hard Quota The limit, which when reached, no further writes are
   allowed.
       Note: The value for advisory quota cannot be greater than the value
       for hard quota.
       The graph shows the currently used (across volumes), reserve limit
       (which is 90% of the total disk space on the cluster), and total
       amount of disk space at the cluster level.
    7. (Optional) Select the schedule(s) to associate with the volume in
       the Schedule tab.
          + [15]Standard Volume
          + [16]Mirror Volume
       The snapshot schedule specifies when snapshots should be
       automatically created.
       Note: If this is not defined, snapshots will not be automatically
       created for this volume.
       Each snapshot created by a schedule has an expiration date that
       determines how long the snapshot is retained.
       You can choose:

   Snapshot Schedule The snapshot schedule specifies how often to take a
   snapshot of the mirror volume for the purpose of preserving the state
   of the mirror before a subsequent mirror operation. This way, if
   corrupt data is copied from the source volume's snapshot into the
   mirror volume, the mirror contents can be rolled back to the snapshot.
   Each snapshot created by a schedule has an expiration date that
   determines how long the snapshot is retained.
   Mirror Schedule The mirror schedule specifies how frequently the mirror
   volume must be synchronize with the source volume. In case of a
   disaster (or any type of data loss on a read-write source volume), the
   data can be recovered from the mirror volume, but any data written to
   the source volume since the last successful mirror operation will not
   be on the mirror volume. Therefore, you should set the mirror schedule
   such that it meets your RPO (Recovery Point Objective).

   Tip: For best performance, select a mirroring schedule according to the
   anticipated rate of data changes and the available bandwidth for
   mirroring. See also: [17]Guidelines for Setting Mirror Schedules.
       When selecting a schedule, you can choose your custom schedule, if
       it exists, or one of the (following) defaults:
          + Critical data
          + Important data
          + Normal data
    8. Click Create Volume to create the volume.

     * If you created a remote mirror, edit the mapr-clusters.conf file so
       that each cluster can resolve the nodes in the other cluster. For
       more information, see [18]Setting Up Cross-Mirroring Between
       Unsecure Clusters.
     * If the source volume at the primary datacenter is in a secure
       cluster, the destination cluster needs authorization to pull data
       from the source cluster in order to create a mirror volume.
       Authorization can be granted by means of a cross-cluster ticket
       generated by the source cluster administrator. For more
       information, see [19]Configuring Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster
       Mirroring and Replication.

Creating a Volume Using the CLI or the REST API

   The basic command to create a volume is:
maprcli volume create -name <name>

   You can create a standard read-write volume and/or a (local or remote)
   mirror volume.
     * [20]Standard Volume
     * [21]Local Mirror Volume
     * [22]Remote Mirror Volume

   The basic command to create a standard volume is:
maprcli volume create -name <volume name> -path <volume path> -type rw

   When creating and mounting a volume, the location of the mount point
   can be specified using the path parameter. The volume that is last in
   the path parameter is referred to as the parent volume. (The parent
   volume is the volume on which the volume link is created.)

   For complete reference information, see [23]volume create.
    1. Log in to the node on the cluster where you want to create the
       mirror.
    2. Use the [24]volume create command to create the mirror volume.
       Specify the source volume name, provide a name for the mirror
       volume, and specify the type as mirror. Optionally, associate a
       schedule with the volume. For example:
maprcli volume create -name volume-a -source volume-a -type mirror -schedule 2
       For complete reference information, see [25]volume create.

    1. Log in to the node on the cluster where you wish to create the
       mirror.
    2. Use the volume create command to create the mirror volume.
       Specify the source volume and cluster in the format
       <volume>@<cluster>, provide a name for the mirror volume, and
       specify the type as mirror. Optionally, associate a schedule with
       the volume. For example:
maprcli volume create -name volume-a -source volume-a@cluster-1 -type mirror -sc
hedule 2
       When creating and mounting a volume, the location of the mount
       point can be specified using the path parameter. The volume that is
       last in the path parameter is referred to as the parent volume.
       (The parent volume is the volume on which the volume link is
       created.)
       For complete reference information, see [26]volume create.
    3. Ensure that each cluster can resolve the nodes in the other
       cluster.
       See:
          + [27]Setting Up Cross-Mirroring Between Unsecure Clusters for
            more information if both the clusters are non-secure.
          + [28]Configuring Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster Mirroring
            and Replication for more information if both clusters are
            secure.

   For the complete list of supported parameters, see [29]volume create.
