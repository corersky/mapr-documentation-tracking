Stopping the Mirror

   Stopping a mirror halts any replication or synchronization process
   currently in progress. Stopping a mirror does not delete or remove the
   mirror volume. You can stop a mirror using MCS and the CLI.

Stopping the Mirror for Multiple Mirror Volumes Using the MapR Control System

   To stop mirroring, in the Summary tab under Data > Volumes:
    1. Select the mirror volume(s) to stop.
       You cannot stop mirror for:
          + Standard volumes
          + Mirror volumes that are currently not mirroring
    2. Select Stop Mirroring from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Stop Mirroring Volume(s) confirmation dialog displays.
    3. Verify the list of volumes to stop and click Stop Mirroring.
       When a mirroring operation is stopped, replication or
       synchronization processes currently in progress will halt.
