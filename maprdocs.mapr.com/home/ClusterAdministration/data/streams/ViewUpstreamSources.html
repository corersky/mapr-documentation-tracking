Listing all Upstream Sources for a Stream

   You can view the list of upstream sources for a stream using MCS and
   the CLI.

Listing all Upstream Sources for a Stream Using the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Replication tab in the [1]stream
   information page.
   The Upstream Sources pane displays the list of upstream sources for the
   selected stream and for each upstream source, the pane displays the
   following:
   Column Name Column Description
   IDX The index number of the upstream stream.
   Upstream Source Cluster The name of the MapR cluster in which the
   upstream stream is located.
   Upstream Source Path The path and name of the upstream stream.
   UUID The upstream stream's universally unique identifier.
   You can [2]add an upstream source and by selecting the checkbox beside
   a stream, you can decouple the selected upstream stream.
