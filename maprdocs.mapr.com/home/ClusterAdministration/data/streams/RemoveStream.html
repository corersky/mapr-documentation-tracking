Removing Streams

   You can delete a stream using MCS and the CLI. Deleted streams cannot
   be recovered unless they were replicated before deletion. After a
   stream in deleted, producers will not be able to publish messages to
   topics in the stream, and consumers will not be able to read messages
   from topics in the stream.

Removing a Stream Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the [1]stream information page.
    2. Click Remove Stream to display the Remove Stream confirmation
       dialog.
    3. Confirm the action by clicking Remove Stream.

Removing a Stream Using the CLI or REST API

   The command to delete a stream is:
stream delete -path <Stream Path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [2]readAce and [3]writeAce on the volume
     * [4]lookupdir on directories in the path

   For complete reference, see [5]stream delete.
