Administering Streams

   MapR-ES brings integrated publish and subscribe messaging to the MapR
   Converged Data Platform. Producer applications can publish messages to
   topics, which are logical collections of messages, and Consumer
   applications can read those messages at their own pace. Topics are
   grouped into streams, for which administrators can apply security,
   retention, and replication policies.
