Adding a Topic to a Stream

   You can manually add a topic to a stream using the MCS and the CLI.

Adding a Topic to a Stream Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Topics tab in the [1]stream information
       page.
    2. Click Add Topic in the All topics pane.
    3. Specify the name of the topic in the Topic Name field.
       A name can include alphanumeric characters and the following
       characters: . (dot), _ (underscore), and - (hyphen).
    4. Specify the number of partitions to use for the topic.
       After you create the topic, you can increase the number of
       partitions, but you cannot reduce the number. If the topic is
       associated with a stream for change log, you cannot modify the
       partitions after you create the topic.
    5. Click Add Topic to create the topic.
