Setting Up Stream Replication Using the CLI

   You can run the maprcli stream replica autosetup command to set up
   master-slave or multi-master replication from an existing source
   stream.
   Note: This procedure describes how to use the maprcli to automatically
   set up stream replication. As an alternative, you can use the [1]MapR
   Control Service (MCS) to automatically set up table replication or use
   the maprcli to[2] manually set up master-slave replication.
   Before you begin, review the following requirements:
     * You must replicate all of the topics that are in a stream. You
       cannot select only a subset of topics to replicate.
     * The maximum number of replicas that a stream can replicate to is
       64.
     * The maximum number of upstream sources that a replica can accept
       data from is 64.
     * In multi-master replication, names of topics must be unique on all
       streams. Messages are assigned sequential offsets. The offsets for
       messages in a topic in one copy could conflict with the offsets for
       messages in the other copy. As a result, messages could be lost.
     * In many-to-one replication, topics with the same name should not be
       replicated to an aggregate replica.

   Set up replication automatically by following these steps:
    1. Log into both the source and destination clusters.
    2. Run the command maprcli stream replica autosetup:
          + For master-slave replication:
maprcli stream replica autosetup -path <path to source stream> -replica <path to
 replica stream>
            For example, to set up master-slave replication from the
            activity stream in the sanfrancisco cluster to a new activity
            stream in the newyork cluster, you could use this command:
maprcli stream replica autosetup -path
/mapr/sanfrancisco/activity -replica /mapr/newyork/activity
          + For multi-master replication:
maprcli stream replica autosetup -path <path to source stream> -replica <path to
 replica stream> -multimaster yes
            For example, to set up multi-master replication between the
            activity stream in the sanfrancisco cluster and a new activity
            stream in the newyork cluster, you could use this command:
maprcli stream replica autosetup -path /mapr/sanfrancisco/activity
-replica /mapr/newyork/activity -multimaster yes
            Note: The parameter -multimaster is an optional parameter that
            you use to set up multimaster replication.
       Note: By default, maprcli stream replica autosetup sets up
       asynchronous replication. If you want to set up synchronous
       replication or use any of the other optional parameters, see
       [3]stream replica autosetup.
    3. To check the replication status, run [4]stream replica list.
