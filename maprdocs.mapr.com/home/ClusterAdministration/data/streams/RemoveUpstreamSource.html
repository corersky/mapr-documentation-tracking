Removing Upstream Sources for a Stream

   You can un-register a stream as an upstream source for a stream using
   the MCS and the CLI. When you remove a stream as an upstream source for
   a stream, the upstream source stream will stop sending updates to the
   stream.

Removing Upstream Sources for a Stream Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go the Replication tab in the [1]stream
       information page.
    2. Select the upstream sources to remove in the Upstream Sources pane
       and click Remove Upstream Source(s).
       The Remove Upstream Source(s) confirmation window displays.
    3. Verify the list and click Remove Upstream Source.
       This action un-registers the selected stream(s) as upstream
       source(s) for this stream.
