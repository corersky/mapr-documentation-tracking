Viewing Stream Information

   You can view stream information including stream properties, topics,
   and replication settings using MCS and the CLI.

Viewing Stream Information Using the MapR Control System

   To view stream information:
    1. Log in to MCS and click Data > Streams.
    2. Locate the stream ([1]by searching or browsing the volumes or by
       entering the full path to the stream) and click on the stream name.
       The stream information page displays the following tabs:
          + Summary
          + [2]Topics
          + [3]Replication
       You can:
          + [4]Modify the stream
          + [5]Remove the stream
       The Summary tab displays:
          + The active and recent alarms in the Alarms pane.
          + The stream settings and permissions in the Detail pane.

Retrieving Stream Information Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to retrieve stream information is:
maprcli stream info -path <Stream Path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [6]readAce on the volume
     * [7]lookupdir on directories in the path
     *

        adminperm
                When a user with this permission runs the command, the
                output includes the access-control expressions for the
                adminperm and topicperm permissions.

        produceperm, consumeperm, or topicperm
                When a user with one of these permissions runs the
                command, the output does not include any access-control
                expressions.
