Resuming Stream Replication

   You can resume replication from one stream to another stream using MCS
   and the CLI.

Resuming Stream Replication Using the MapR Control System

   To resume one or more replications:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Replication tab in the [1]stream
       information page.
    2. Select the replicas (in Paused state) in the Replicas pane.
       Selecting the checkbox next to a replica makes the Actions dropdown
       menu available.
    3. Select Resume Replication from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Resume Replication confirmation window displays.
    4. Verify the list of replicas to resume and click Resume Replication.
       This action resumes replication from the source stream to the
       selected replica stream(s).

Resuming Stream Replication Using the CLI or REST API

   The command to resume a replication is:
maprcli stream replica resume -path <stream path> -replica <remote stream path>
