Adding Upstream Source for a Stream

   You can register a stream as an upstream source for a stream using MCS
   and the CLI. When you register a stream as an upstream source, the
   registered upstream source stream will send updates to the stream.

Adding Upstream Source for a Stream Using the MapR Control System

   To register a stream as an upstream source:
    1. Log in to MCS and go the [1]stream information page.
    2. Click Add Upstream Source in the Upstream Sources pane.
       The Add Upstream Sources window displays.
    3. Specify the path and name of the source stream in the Upstream
       Source field.
    4. Click Add Upstream Source to register the source stream as an
       upstream source for this stream.

Adding Upstream Source for a Stream Using the CLI or REST API

   The command to add an upstream source is:
maprcli stream upstream add -path <stream path> -upstream <upstream stream path>

   For complete reference information, see [2]stream upstream add.
