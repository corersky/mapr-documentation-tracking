Pausing Table Replication

   You can pause table replication of data from a source MapR-DB binary or
   JSON table to a replica MapR-DB binary or JSON table respectively using
   MCS and the CLI.

Pausing Table Replication Using MCS

    1. Go to the table information page.
       See [1]Viewing Table Information.
    2. Click Replicas to go to that tab.
    3. Select the replicas to pause by clicking the associated checkbox.
       Selecting the checkbox next to a replica makes the Actions dropdown
       menu available.
    4. Select Pause Replication from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Pause Replication confirmation window displays.
    5. Verify the list of replicas to pause and click Pause Replication to
       pause replication on the selected replicas.
       If necessary, click [removeSelection.png] to remove a replica from
       being paused.

   The pause replication, run the following command:
maprcli table replica pause -path <table path> -replica <replica table path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce and writeAce on both the source volume and the target
       volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the paths of both tables
     * readperm and replperm permissions on the source table
