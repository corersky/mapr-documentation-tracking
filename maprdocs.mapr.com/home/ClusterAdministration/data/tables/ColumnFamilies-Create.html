Creating Column Families

   There are several methods that you can use to create column families in
   MapR-DB tables. To create column families, you must have the following
   permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path to the table
     * createrenamefamilyperm on the table

Creating Column Families Using MCS

   To create a column family from MCS, under Data > Tables:
    1. Click:
          + Take me to Add Column Family after creating a new table.
          + Add Column Family in the Column Families tab in the table
            information page.
            See [4]Viewing Table Information.
    2. Specify the following properties to set up column families.
          + [5]JSON Table
          + [6]Binary Table

   Column Family Name The name of the column family.
   JSON Path The path to the column family in dotted notation. For
   example, suppose the table contained JSON documents that were of this
   general structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}

   If you want to create a column family at the field d nested within b,
   your new path would be a.b.d.

   Note: Ensure that the field at which you want to create the column
   family does not yet exist. If the field exists, it could become
   inaccessible after the column family is created.
   Compression The compression setting to use for the column family. Valid
   options are off, lzf, lz4, and zlib. The default setting is the same as
   the compression setting for the directory where the table is located.
   To find out whether a directory is compressed and the type of
   compression, see [7]Turning Compression On or Off on Directories Using
   the CLI.
   Time-to-Live Specifies whether to purge data when the age of the data
   in this column family exceeds the value specified here. Data can remain
   forever or can be purged after specified amount of time (in seconds).
   Setting the value to 0 is equivalent to allowing data to remain
   indefinitely or forever.

   Note: If the value for an existing column family in a JSON table is not
   0, you cannot add another column family.
   In Memory Determines whether preference is given to values of this
   column family for storage with row keys. Because row keys are cached in
   memory in preference to row data, column-family data that is stored
   inline with the row keys is also cached in memory.

   For all column families in a table together, up to 200 bytes of row
   data will be stored inline with each row key. Storing data inline with
   a row key might speed retrieval of the data from a column family
   because disk access can often be avoided. For each column family, up to
   32 bytes can be stored inline with each row key even if this is
   disabled (No), but preference will be given to column families where
   this is enabled (Yes). A column family can have more than 32 bytes
   stored inline if this is enabled.
   If the total number of bytes for all column families together exceeds
   200 for a row, then preference for inclusion within the inline storage
   for that row is given to column families that have this enabled.
   Note: All of the data for a column family will be stored in-line with
   the row key, or none will be. If the contents in a column family for a
   particular row are larger than the maximum number of bytes that are
   allowed to be stored for that column family, no data will be stored
   in-line for that column family.
   By default, this is enabled.

   Column Family Name The name of the column family.
   Version
          + Minimum — The minimum number of versions of column values to
            keep. The default is zero.
          + Maximum — Maximum number of versions of column values to keep.
            The default is one.

   Compression The compression setting to use for the column family. Valid
   options are off, lzf, lz4, and zlib. The default setting is the same as
   the compression setting for the directory where the table is located.
   To find out whether a directory is compressed and the type of
   compression, see [8]Turning Compression On or Off on Directories Using
   the CLI.
   Time-to-Live Specifies whether to purge data when the age of the data
   in this column family exceeds the value specified here. Data can remain
   forever or can be purged after specified amount of time (in seconds).
   Setting the value to 0 is equivalent to allowing data to remain
   indefinitely or forever.
   In Memory Determines whether preference is given to values of this
   column family for storage with row keys. Because row keys are cached in
   memory in preference to row data, column-family data that is stored
   inline with the row keys is also cached in memory.

   For all column families in a table together, up to 200 bytes of row
   data will be stored inline with each row key. Storing data inline with
   a row key might speed retrieval of the data from a column family
   because disk access can often be avoided. For each column family, up to
   32 bytes can be stored inline with each row key even if this is
   disabled (No), but preference will be given to column families where
   this is enabled (Yes). A column family can have more than 32 bytes
   stored inline if this is enabled.
   If the total number of bytes for all column families together exceeds
   200 for a row, then preference for inclusion within the inline storage
   for that row is given to column families that have this enabled.
   Note: All of the data for a column family will be stored in-line with
   the row key, or none will be. If the contents in a column family for a
   particular row are larger than the maximum number of bytes that are
   allowed to be stored for that column family, no data will be stored
   in-line for that column family.
   By default, this is enabled.
    3. Set up access to column families for users, groups, and/or roles.
       You can use either the default permissions or proceed to define new
       permissions for this column family.
          + [9]JSON Table
          + [10]Binary Table

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Traverse Data Can pass over fields in JSON documents. For example,
   suppose that a JSON table contains documents of this general structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" : "value",
               "c" : "value"
          }
}

   Suppose further that the user sjohnson has read permission on a.b, but
   not on a. For sjohnson to read a.b, the user needs the traverse
   permission on a. The user can then pass over field a to a.b. This
   permission is inherited by fields within the column family.
   Set Version Can set or change the maximum and minimum number of
   versions of column values to keep.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Append Data Can do column appends. Column appends require permission
   both at the column-family level and at the column level.
   Set Version Can set or change the maximum and minimum number of
   versions of column values to keep.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.
       By default, all permissions are given to the user creating the
       table.
       To grant or block access to users, groups, and/or roles, from the:
          + Basic settings, select the type — public, (OR) user, group, or
            role — from the drop-down menu, specify the name of the user,
            group, or role, and select one or more checkbox to grant
            permissions.
            Tip: Click [cloneACE.png] to create a copy of the associated
            access control setting. Click [deleteRow.png] to remove the
            associated access control expression.
            To add access control expressions for another user, group, or
            role, click Add Another and repeat this step.
          + Advanced settings, or specify public (p) or user (u), group
            (g), and/or role (r) who have and/or do not have the type of
            access using the following boolean expressions and
            subexpressions:
               o ! — Negation operator.
               o & — AND operation.
               o | — OR operation.
            Use (), parentheses, for subexpressions.
            Note: You cannot specify user, group, or role individually if
            access is granted to all users (public).
            Alternatively, click [editPencil.png] associated with the type
            of access to use the Access Control Expression window to
            define access for public or users, group, and/or role. See
            [11]Defining ACEs for more information.
       Note: If you switch from Basic to Advanced, the basic settings, if
       any, will be carried over to the advanced settings. If you switch
       from Advanced to Basic, all the settings will be lost because the
       subexpressions and AND (&) and negation (!) operations that are
       supported by advanced settings are not supported in the basic
       settings.
    4. Specify:

        Field Permissions (for JSON Tables)
                Specify a name for the field and the permissions to access
                the field. By default, a field inherits permissions from
                the column in which the field is located. Permissions set
                at this level override permissions inherited from the
                column. You can set the following permissions by selecting
                the associated checkbox:

   Read Data Can read from the field. This permission extends to fields
   that are nested below as well unless explicitly denied on any of the
   nested fields.
   Write Data Can delete the field, insert a value into the field, or
   overwrite the field's value.

   Note: Deleting a field also deletes all fields that are nested within
   that field, even those fields on which the write permission is
   explicitly denied.
   JSON Traverse Can descend a hierarchy of fields to access the fields to
   read or write.

                By default, all permissions are given to the user creating
                the table. See [12]Permission Types for Fields and Column
                Families in JSON Tables for more information.

        Column Permission (for Binary Tables)
                Create (by clicking Add Column and specifying a name in
                the Column Name field) and set permissions for columns in
                the column family. You can set the following permissions
                by selecting the associated checkbox:

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Append Data Can do column appends. Column appends require permission
   both at the column-family level and at the column level.

                Note: When a user, group, or role requests to read data
                from, write data to, or append data to a column, MapR-DB
                checks whether that user, group, or role has read or write
                permission for the column family AND read or write
                permission for the column. By default, columns allow read
                and write access to all users; in such cases, only the
                read or write permission for the column family matters.

                However, suppose that a table contains columns col1 and
                col2 in column family cf1, and these columns grant read
                and write permission only to the table creator. A
                different user tries to write data to these columns.
                MapR-DB checks whether this user has write permission on
                cf1 AND col1 AND col2. If the user does not have all three
                permissions, MapR-DB returns an error that says access for
                the write is denied.

                If this user were to try to read from the same two
                columns, MapR-DB would simply not return the data. If the
                user tried to read from those two columns and additional
                columns on which the user had read permissions, the
                results would contain the data for those additional
                columns, but exclude the data for col1 and col2.

                You can add columns to a table at any time. Null columns
                for a given row don't take up any storage space.

                Note: Extremely wide tables with very large numbers of
                columns can sometimes reach the recommended size for a
                table split at a comparatively small number of rows
                because MapR-DB tables split at the row level, not the
                column level.

       To grant or block access to users, groups, and/or roles, from the:
          + Basic settings, select the type — public, (OR) user, group, or
            role — from the drop-down menu, specify the name of the user,
            group, or role, and select one or more checkbox to grant
            permissions.
            Tip: Click [cloneACE.png] to create a copy of the associated
            access control setting. Click [deleteRow.png] to remove the
            associated access control expression.
            To add access control expressions for another user, group, or
            role, click Add Another and repeat this step.
          + Advanced settings, or specify public (p) or user (u), group
            (g), and/or role (r) who have and/or do not have the type of
            access using the following boolean expressions and
            subexpressions:
               o ! — Negation operator.
               o & — AND operation.
               o | — OR operation.
            Use (), parentheses, for subexpressions.
            Note: You cannot specify user, group, or role individually if

            [13]Defining ACEs for more information.
       Note: If you switch from Basic to Advanced, the basic settings, if
       any, will be carried over to the advanced settings. If you switch
       from Advanced to Basic, all the settings will be lost because the
       subexpressions and AND (&) and negation (!) operations that are
       supported by advanced settings are not supported in the basic
       settings.
    5. Click Add Column Family to add the column family to the table.

Creating Column Families Using CLI or the REST API

     * [14]JSON Table
     * [15]Binary Table

   To create a column family in a JSON table, include the parameters
   -jsonpath and -force :
maprcli table cf create -path <path> -cfname <name_of_column_family> -jsonpath
                                <path> -force true

   For the full list of options for this command, see [16]table cf create.
   The -jsonpath parameter specifies the path to the column family. The
   path is in dotted notation. For example, suppose the table contained
   JSON documents that were of this general structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}

   You want to create a column family at the field d in the new path a.b.d
   because you plan to store image files in fields in that column family.
   Important: Ensure that the field at which you want to create the column
   family does not yet exist. Also ensure that there are no secondary
   indexes defined on the field. If the field does exist or is a field in
   an index, the data in the field could become inaccessible after you
   create the column family.

   By default, every time you try to create a non-default column family in
   a JSON table, this command fails and returns a warning message that you
   should ensure there is no existing data at the specified path. Set the
   -force parameter to true if you want to override this warning mechanism
   and create a column family.
   The command to create a column family for a binary table is:
maprcli table cf create -path <path> -cfname <name_of_column_family>

   For the full list of options for this command, see [17]table cf create.

   The format of the value of the -path parameter depends on whether you
   are creating a table on a local cluster or a remote cluster.

Creating a Column Family for a Binary Table Using HBase Shell

   After starting the HBase shell, run the alter command. Type help to see
   a list of commands and their syntax.
