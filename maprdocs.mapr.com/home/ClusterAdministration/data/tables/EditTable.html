Editing Tables

   Use either the maprcli command table edit or MCS to edit the attributes
   of a MapR-DB binary or JSON table. You can also use the HBase shell to
   edit a binary table.

Editing Tables Using MCS

   To edit a (JSON or Binary) table using MCS:
    1. Go to the table information page.
       See [1]Viewing Table Information.
    2. Click Edit Table.
       The Edit Table page displays.
    3. Make changes (optional) to the following properties:

   Auto Split Enable (Yes) or disable (No) auto-splitting of table. If
   enabled, the table will be split automatically into regions as the
   table grows. If disabled, the table can be split manually into regions.
   By default, this is enabled.
   Bulkload Enable (Yes) or disable (No) full bulk load of the table.
   Enable Auditing Enable (Yes) or disable (No) auditing of table
   operations. If auditing is enabled at the cluster and volume levels,
   enabling auditing will cause auditing to start for the table.
    4. Make changes (optional) to the permissions.
         a. Make changes to USER ACCESS CONTROLS under Table Setup and
            Authorization.
            Modify the list of users, groups, and/or roles that have
            and/or do not have the following types of access to the table:

   Admin Can view and edit the permissions for the table.
   Force Pack Can pack table regions.
   Split Merge Can take the following actions:
               o Split the table into regions or merge regions of the
                 table together.
               o Change the size of the region.

   Bulkload Can load this table with bulk loads if the table was created
   with bulk load support.
   Replication Access Can set up replication either to or from a table.
   Create/Rename Column Family Can create column families for this table
   or rename existing column families.
   Delete Column Family Can delete column families associated with the
   table.
            To grant or block access to users, groups, and/or roles, from
            the:
               o Basic settings, select the type — public, (OR) user,
                 group, or role — from the drop-down menu, specify the
                 name of the user, group, or role, and select one or more
                 checkbox to grant permissions.
                 Tip: Click [cloneACE.png] to create a copy of the
                 associated access control setting. Click [deleteRow.png]
                 to remove the associated access control expression.
                 To add access control expressions for another user,
                 group, or role, click Add Another and repeat this step.
               o Advanced settings, or specify public (p) or user (u),
                 group (g), and/or role (r) who have and/or do not have
                 the type of access using the following boolean
                 expressions and subexpressions:
                    # ! — Negation operator.
                    # & — AND operation.
                    # | — OR operation.
                 Use (), parentheses, for subexpressions.
                 Note: You cannot specify user, group, or role
                 individually if access is granted to all users (public).
                 Alternatively, click [editPencil.png] associated with the
                 type of access to use the Access Control Expression
                 window to define access for public or users, group,
                 and/or role. See [2]Defining ACEs for more information.
            Note: If you switch from Basic to Advanced, the basic
            settings, if any, will be carried over to the advanced
            settings. If you switch from Advanced to Basic, all the
            settings will be lost because the subexpressions and AND (&)
            and negation (!) operations that are supported by advanced
            settings are not supported in the basic settings.
         b. Make changes to Default Column Family Authorization.
               o [3]JSON Table
               o [4]Binary Table
            Modify the list of users, groups, and/or roles that have
            and/or do not have the following types of access to the
            default column family:

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Traverse Data Can pass over fields in JSON documents. For example,
   suppose that a JSON table contains documents of this general structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" : "value",
               "c" : "value"
          }
}

   Suppose further that the user sjohnson has read permission on a.b, but
   not on a. For sjohnson to read a.b, the user needs the traverse
   permission on a. The user can then pass over field a to a.b. This
   permission is inherited by fields within the column family.
   Set Version Can set or change the maximum and minimum number of
   versions of column values to keep.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.
            Modify the list of users, groups, and/or roles that have
            and/or do not have the following types of access to the
            default column family:

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Append Data Can do column appends. Column appends require permission
   both at the column-family level and at the column level.
   Set Version Can set or change the maximum and minimum number of
   versions of column values to keep.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.
            To grant or block access to users, groups, and/or roles, from
            the:
               o Basic settings, select the type — public, (OR) user,
                 group, or role — from the drop-down menu, specify the
                 name of the user, group, or role, and select one or more
                 checkbox to grant permissions.
                 Tip: Click [cloneACE.png] to create a copy of the
                 associated access control setting. Click [deleteRow.png]
                 to remove the associated access control expression.
                 To add access control expressions for another user,
                 group, or role, click Add Another and repeat this step.
               o Advanced settings, or specify public (p) or user (u),
                 group (g), and/or role (r) who have and/or do not have
                 the type of access using the following boolean
                 expressions and subexpressions:
                    # ! — Negation operator.
                    # & — AND operation.
                    # | — OR operation.
                 Use (), parentheses, for subexpressions.
                 Note: You cannot specify user, group, or role
                 individually if access is granted to all users (public).
                 Alternatively, click [editPencil.png] associated with the
                 type of access to use the Access Control Expression
                 window to define access for public or users, group,
                 and/or role. See [5]Defining ACEs for more information.
            Note: If you switch from Basic to Advanced, the basic
            settings, if any, will be carried over to the advanced
            settings. If you switch from Advanced to Basic, all the
            settings will be lost because the subexpressions and AND (&)
            and negation (!) operations that are supported by advanced
            settings are not supported in the basic settings.
    5. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

Editing Tables Using the CLI or the REST API

   Run the command maprcli table edit -path <path> .
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   When you edit a table with this command, you can change a number of
   properties.
     * Enable or disable auditing, autosplitting, and bulkloading
     * Set permissions on table
     * Set permissions for default column families

   For full reference for this command, see [6]table edit.

Editing Binary Tables Using HBase Shell

   After starting the HBase shell, run the alter command. Type help to see
   a list of commands and their syntax.
