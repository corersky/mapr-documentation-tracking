Removing Table Replicas

   You can un-register one or more replicas using MCS and the CLI.

Removing Replication Using MCS

    1. Go to the table information page.
       See [1]Viewing Table Information.
    2. Click Replicas to go to that tab.
    3. Select the replicas to remove by clicking the associated checkbox.
       Selecting the checkbox next to a replica makes the Actions
       drop-down menu available.
    4. Select Remove Replica(s) from the Actions drop-down menu.
       The Remove Replica(s) confirmation window displays.
    5. Verify the list of replicas to remove and click Remove Replica.
       If necessary, click [removeSelection.png] to remove a replica.
       The selected replicas are no longer replicas of the source table
       and will no longer receive updates from the source table. You must
       also remove upstream source to remove the association between the
       source table and the replica table. For more information, see
       Removing Upstream Sources.

Removing Replication Using the CLI or REST API

   The un-register a replica, run the following command:
maprcli table replica remove -path <table path> -replica <replica table path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce and writeAce on both the source volume and the target
       volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the paths of both tables
     * readperm and replperm permissions on the source table

   For complete reference, see [2]table replica remove.
