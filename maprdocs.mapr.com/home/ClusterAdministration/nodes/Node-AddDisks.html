Adding Disks to MapR-FS

   You can add disks to MapR-FS using MCS and the CLI. Before adding the
   disks to MapR-FS, add the physical disks to the node or nodes according
   to the correct hardware procedure.
     * If you are removing and replacing failed disks, you must install
       the replacements, then re-add the replacement disks to MapR-FS,
       along with the other disks that were in the same storage pool(s) as
       the failed disks. See [1]Handling Disk Failures for more details.
     * If you are removing disks but not replacing them, you can just
       re-add the other disks that were in the same storage pool(s) as the
       failed disks.

   Note: Disks must be added on CLDB nodes one node at a time when Warden
   and MapR services are running.

Adding Disks Using the MapR Control System

   Complete the following steps to add disks of type MapR-FS using the
   MapR Control System:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Summary tab in the [2]node information
       page.
    2. Select the disks not yet added to MapR-FS in the Disks pane and
       click Add Disk(s) to MapR-FS.
       The Add Disk(s) to MapR-FS confirmation dialog displays.
       Note: You cannot select disks of type System to add.
    3. Review the list and click Add Disk.
       The disks are automatically formatted and properly-sized storage
       pools are automatically allocated.

Adding Disks Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to add disks to a node is:
maprcli disk add -disks <disk names> -host <host>

   Note: This step reformats the disks. Any data on these disks will be
   lost.

   For complete reference information, see [3]disk add.
