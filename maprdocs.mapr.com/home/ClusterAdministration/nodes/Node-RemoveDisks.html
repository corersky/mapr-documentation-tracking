Removing Disks from MapR-FS

   When you remove a disk from MapR-FS, other disks in the storage pool
   are also removed automatically from MapR-FS and are no longer in use
   (they are available but off-line). Their disk storage goes to 0%, and
   they are eligible to be re-added to MapR-FS to build a new storage
   pool. You can either replace the disk and re-add it along with the
   other disks that were in the storage pool, or just re-add the other
   disks if you do not plan to replace the disk you removed. See [1]Adding
   Disks to MapR-FS for more information.
   Warning: Removing a disk in the storage pool that contains Container ID
   1 will shut down CLDB, triggering a CLDB failover. Container ID 1
   contains CLDB data for the master CLDB. From the command-line, run the
   maprcli disk remove command without the -force 1 option first and
   examine the warning messages to make sure you aren't removing the disk
   with Container ID 1. To safely remove such a disk, perform a [2]CLDB
   Failover to make one of the other CLDB nodes the primary CLDB, then
   remove the disk as normal.
   Before removing or replacing disks, make sure the Replication Alarm
   (VOLUME_ALARM_DATA_UNDER_REPLICATED) and Data Alarm
   (VOLUME_ALARM_DATA_UNAVAILABLE) are not raised. These alarms can
   indicate potential or actual data loss. If either alarm is raised, you
   might be able to repair the problem using the /opt/mapr/server/fsck
   utility before removing or replacing disks.
   Note: Using the /opt/mapr/server/fsck utility with the -r flag to
   repair a filesystem risks data loss. Call MapR support before using
   /opt/mapr/server/fsck -r.

Removing Disks from MapR-FS Using the MapR Control System

   Complete the following steps to remove disks using the MapR Control
   System:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Summary tab in the [3]node information
       page.
    2. Select the disks to remove disks in the Disks pane and click Remove
       Disk(s) from MapR-FS.
       The Remove Disk(s) from MapR-FS confirmation dialog displays.
       Warning: One or more disks you selected may have unreplicated data
       on it and this action will forcefully remove the disks.
    3. Review the list and click Remove Disk.
       Wait several minutes while the removal process completes. After you
       remove the disks, any other disks in the same storage pools are
       taken offline and marked as available (not in use by MapR).
    4. Remove the physical disks from the node or nodes according to the
       correct hardware procedure.
    5. From a command line terminal, remove the failed disk log file from
       the /opt/mapr/logs directory.
       These log files are typically named like this:
diskname.failed.info

Removing Disks from MapR-FS Using the CLI or REST API

    1. On the node, determine which disk to remove/replace by examining
       Disk entries in the /opt/mapr/logs/faileddisk.log file.
    2. Run the following command, substituting the hostname or IP address
       for <host> and a list of disks for <disks>
maprcli disk remove -disks <disk names> -host <host>
       Note: This command does not remove a disk containing unreplicated
       data unless forced.
       For complete reference information, see [4]disk remove.
    3. Examine the screen output in response to the command you ran in
       step 2.
       For example:
# maprcli disk remove -host `hostname -f` -disks /dev/sdd
message   host   disk
removed.  host1  /dev/sdd
removed.  host1  /dev/sde
removed.  host1  /dev/sdf
       Make a note of the additional disks removed when the disk is
       removed. For example, the disks /dev/sde and /dev/sdf are part of
       the same storage pool and therefore removed along with the disk
       (/dev/sdd).
    4. Confirm that the removed disks do not appear in the disktab file.
    5. Remove the disk log file from the /opt/mapr/logs directory.
       For failed disks, these log files are typically named in the
       pattern diskname.failed.info.

   When a failed disk has been replaced, it should be [5]added back to
   MapR-FS along with the other disks from the same storage pool that were
   previously removed. If you add only the replacement disk to MapR-FS,
   this will result in a non-optimal storage pool layout, which can lead
   to degraded performance.

   Once the disks are added to MapR-FS, the cluster allocates
   properly-sized storage pools automatically. For example, if you add ten
   disks, MapR allocates two storage pools of three disks each and two
   storage pools of two disks each.
