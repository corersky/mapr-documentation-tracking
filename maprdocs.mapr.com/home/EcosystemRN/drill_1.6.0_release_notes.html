Noteworthy New Features in the MapR Distribution of Drill

   This release provides enhanced query improvements with the following
   bug fixes and improvements:
     * JDK 1.8 support.
     * JSON and binary table support through the MapR-DB format plugin.
     * [5]Inbound impersonation which is useful in a multi-tier
       architecture where queries must run as the end user instead of the
       application user.
     * More [6]custom frames in the window function frame clause.
     * [7]Row count based pruning for Limit N queries
     * [8]Lazy reading of parquet metadata caching
     * [9]Early application of partition pruning in query planning

   Additional bug fixes and enhancements listed in the [10]Apache Drill
   1.6.0 Release Notes.

Resolved Issues

   The following table lists resolved issues in Drill 1.6.0:
   Issue Description
   MD-803 LIMIT 0 optimization applies to the ranking and value window
   functions.
   MD-784 LIMIT 0 optimization applies to the Hive UDF xpath_double.
   MD-781 LIMIT 0 optimization applies to the TRIM function.
   MD-608 Complex data functions FLATTEN and KVGEN no longer return null
   data when you issue queries through the ODBC driver.
   MD-604 EXTRACT function with seconds no longer returns incorrect data
   when you issue queries through the ODBC driver.
   MD-361 Drill honors the Hive skip.header.line.count and
   skip.footer.line.count table properties and skips header and footer
   lines when querying Hive tables created with these properties.

Known Issues

   The following table lists known issues in Drill 1.6.0:
   Issue Description
   MD-851 Pushdown is disabled for columns with TIMESTAMP values which
   makes these columns case-insensitive. See [11]Limitations.
   MD-845 LIMIT 0 optimization does not apply when used in a query with a
   FULL OUTER JOIN and the planner.enable_mergejoin option is set to true.
   MD-817 LIMIT 0 optimization does not apply when a query contains math
   operations between an interval type and a constant.
   MD-802 LIMIT 0 optimization applies to the AVG window function.
   MD-794 LIMIT 0 optimization does not apply when the return type is
   VARBINARY.
   MD-787 LIMIT 0 optimization does not apply to the Hive BIN function.
   MD-786 LIMIT 0 does not apply to the Hive HEX function.
   MD-747 SUM function queries with a decimal argument and LIMIT 0
   optimization returns the wrong data types and nullability.
   MD-727 If you query a column that does not exist in the records of the
   queried table, Drill does not return any rows when it should return
   rows with null values. See [12]Limitations.

Limitations

   (MD-851) Pushdown filtering is disabled on columns with TIMESTAMP
   values, which results in these columns being case-insensitive. For
   example, if a JSON table is created with the following JSON records
   where the “access” columns are not of a particular case:
{"_id":"ID1","name":"Alice","age":"25","access":"2013-10-23 11:11:11","DOB":{"$d
ateDay":"1988-01-01"},"salary":"50.00"}
{"_id":"ID2","name":"Bob","age":"21","access":"2013-10-23 11:11:11","DOB":{"$dat
eDay":"1988-01-01"},"salary":"150.00"}
{"_id":"ID3","name":"Frank","age":"32","ACCESS":"2013-10-23 11:11:11","dob":{"$d
ateDay":"1988-01-01"},"salary":"250.00"}

   Running a query on the “access” column returns all values because Drill
   does not push the filtering process down to MapR-DB to get the subset
   of columns from records where the name is "access" in lowercase.
   Instead, MapR-DB returns every value from each record that has a column
   named "access", regardless of the case. If some records include a
   column named "ACCESS" or "Access," these values are also returned in
   the result set.
SELECT * FROM dfs.`/tmp/data/student_db` where access = timestamp '2013-10-23 11
:11:11';
+------+----------------------+------+-------------+-----------+---------+
| _id  |        access        | age  |     dob     |   name    | salary  |
+------+----------------------+------+-------------+-----------+---------+
| ID1  | 2013-10-23 11:11:11  | 25   | 1988-01-01  | Alice  | 50.00   |
| ID2  | 2013-10-23 11:11:11  | 21   | 1980-12-12  | Bob     | 150.00  |
| ID3  | 2013-10-23 11:11:11  | 32   | 1970-10-12  | Frank      | 250.00  |
+------+----------------------+------+-------------+-----------+---------+
3 rows selected (0.223 seconds)

   In comparison, you can see that a query on the “dob” column in the same
   table produces only one result because the column does not contain
   TIMESTAMP values and is therefore case-sensitive:
SELECT * FROM dfs.`/tmp/data/student_db` where dob = date '1988-01-01';
+------+----------------------+------+-------------+-------+---------+
| _id  |        ACCESS        | age  |     dob     | name  | salary  |
+------+----------------------+------+-------------+-------+---------+
| ID3  | 2013-10-23 11:11:11  | 32   | 1988-01-01  | Frank  | 250.00  |
+------+----------------------+------+-------------+-------+---------+
1 row selected (0.359 seconds)

   Although there are three records with “dob” columns, there is only one
   record with the column name in lowercase.
   (MD-727) If you query one column that is partially or completely
   non-existent in the records of the queried table, Drill does not return
   any rows for the records when it should return the rows with null
   values. For example, if a JSON table is created from the following JSON
   records where only one record has a “time” column with a value and the
   other two records do not have time columns:
{"_id":"student1", "name":"Alice", "street":"123 Ballmer Av", "zipcode":12345, "
state":"CA"},
{"_id":"student2", "name":"Bob", "time":"2016-03-08", "street":"1 Infinite Loop"
, "zipcode":12345, "state":"CA"},
{"_id":"student3", "name":"Frank", "street":"435 Walker Ct", "zipcode":12345, "s
tate":"CA"}

   The query returns only one row for the record in which the time column
   exists with a value instead of returning three rows with two rows
   having null values in the column.
SELECT `time` FROM dfs.`/user/root/students`;
+-----------+
| time      |
+-----------+
| 2016-03-08|
+-----------+

   In comparison, if you query all of the columns in the table, you can
   see that the query returns all records and includes null values for
   records missing a time column.
SELECT * FROM dfs.`/user/root/students`;
+-----------+--------+--------+------------------+----------+-------------+
|    _id    |  name  | state  |      street      | zipcode  |    time     |
+-----------+--------+--------+------------------+----------+-------------+
| student1  | Alice  | CA     | 123 Ballmer Av   | 12345.0  | null        |
| student2  | Bob    | CA     | 1 Infinite Loop  | 12345.0  | 2016-03-08  |
| student3  | Frank  | CA     | 435 Walker Ct    | 12345.0  | null        |
+-----------+--------+--------+------------------+----------+-------------+
3 rows selected (0.314 seconds)
