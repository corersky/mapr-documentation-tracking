Feature Support

     * MapR supports Hive-2.1.1 on Tez-0.8.4. For more information, see
       [9]Tez 0.8.4-1803 (MEP 3.0.3) Release Notes.
     * MapR does not support Hive on Spark, so you cannot use Spark as an
       execution engine for Hive. However, you can run Hive and Spark on
       the same cluster. You can also use Spark SQL and Drill to query
       Hive tables.
     * MapR does not support HDFS encryption in Hive tables.
     * MapR does not support HBase with Hive-2.1.1 starting from
       mapr-core-6.0.0.
     * MapR does not support LLAP with Hive-2.1.1 as Apache Slider is not
       a MapR ecosystem component.
     * Starting from Hive 2.1, Hive needs to run the schematool command as
       an initialization step.

New Features

     * Added PAM authentication support for HiveServer2 Web UI.
     * Added REST API WebHCat SSL encryption support.
     * Added separate files for HiveServer2 and HiveMetastore logs.

Known Issues and Limitations

     * The hive-site.xml file permissions is 640.
     * For accessing and using Hive, administrators have the ability to
       manage permissions for "Other" users. There are at least two
       available options on how to enable the using of hive-site.xml:
         1. Add users who want to work with Hive to a mapr group.
         2. Set permission to 644 to make it world-readable.
