Resolved Issues

   The following table lists resolved issues in Drill 1.6.0 - 1606:
   Issue Description
   DRILL-4715 Queries with multiple, non-trivial expressions no longer
   cause compilation errors at runtime due to memory limits imposed by the
   JVM.
   DRILL-4694 Drill no longer adds extraneous NULL fields to JSON output
   files when you issue the CTAS statement to create JSON output from an
   existing JSON file. A new option, store.json.writer.skip_null_fields,
   controls this behavior. By default, store.json.writer.skip_null_fields
   = true and skips NULL fields. Setting
   store.json.writer.skip_null_fields = false reverts the behavior.
   DRILL-4693 Columns now appear in the correct order when you issue a
   SELECT list expression with the COVERT_FROM function and the format
   type is JSON.
   DRILL-4679 Queries that contain the CONVERT_FROM function with the JSON
   format type no longer fail with the following error when the input data
   has 0 rows due to a filter condition:
Error: SYSTEM ERROR: IllegalStateException: next() returned NONE without first r
eturning OK_NEW_SCHEMA [#16, ProjectRecordBatch]Fragment 0:0

   DRILL-4676 Canceling a query during planning no longer blocks the
   drillbit from accepting new queries.
   DRILL-4657 Running a query with the RANK function no longer produces
   incorrect results when a frame does not fit into two batches of data.
   DRILL-4654 Drill now uses JMX ([3]Java Management Extensions) to
   monitor queries at runtime and provide the following new metrics
   through the Drill Web Console and JConsole:
     * pending/running/completed queries
     * current memory usage (root allocator)

   DRILL-4647 In instances when a drillbit is not running or query
   submission fails, the C++ client correctly propagates failed connection
   errors back to the application.
   DRILL-4476 The UNION ALL operator now supports scenarios where the
   query expression on either side of the UNION ALL operator references an
   empty source.
   DRILL-3714 Queries no longer remain in a CANCELLATION_REQUESTED state
   until the drillbits are restarted.
   MD-850 Queries that contain two numbers CAST as decimals and added
   together no longer result in a data type mismatch.
   MD-849 Queries on JSON files that contain two index levels no longer
   fail with an IndexOutOfBoundsException error.
   MD-815 Queries on INFORMATION_SCHEMA (hive metadata) are significantly
   faster due to the use of a bulk load algorithm when the
   exec.enable_bulk_load_table_list system option is set to true:
ALTER SYSTEM SET `exec.enable_bulk_load_table_list` = true
