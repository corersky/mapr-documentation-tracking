   3024b71 2016-08-01 MAPR-24129: Backported SPARK-16796 so that passwords
   are now masked on the Environment page of the Spark History Server UI.
   7755848 2016-08-16 [MARP-24264] The following patches have been
   backported to resolve the Spark vulnerability to code injection in the
   toCommentSafeString method:
     * [SPARK-11352][SQL][BRANCH-1.5] Escape */ in the generated comments.
     * [SPARK-12138][SQL] Escape \u in the generated comments of codegen
     * [SPARK-15165][SQL] Codegen can break because toCommentSafeString is
       not actually safe

   For more information, see [8]Spark Vulnerability with the
   toCommentSafeString Method.
   04c451a 2016-08-18 [MAPR-24292] MapR-ES consumer no longer fails to
   read the first message when the message contains a single string.
   12df59b 2016-08-25 [MAPR-24263] The Spark assembly and example JAR
   files no longer include a dependency on MapR-FS libraries.

Known Issues

     * MAPR-17271: On secure clusters, the MapR Control System (MCS) does
       not display links for Spark-Master and Spark-HistoryServer.
     * MAPR-19761: On a secure cluster, MapR does not support the Spark
       SQL Thrift JDBC server. When the cluster is secure, the Spark
       Thrift server will not start.
