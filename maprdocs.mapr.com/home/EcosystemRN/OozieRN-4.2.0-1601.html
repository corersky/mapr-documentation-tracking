New in this Release

   This release of Apache Oozie includes the following behavior change
   that is specific to MapR:
     * Whenever you upgrade or get the latest Oozie package, you must
       update the shared libraries on the MapR-FS. When you restart Oozie,
       the shared libraries are no longer automatically updated unless you
       change the cluster MapReduce mode or the default sharedlib
       directory (/oozie/share/) does not exist. See MapR's Oozie upgrade
       documentation for details.

   For details on the features available in the open source version of
   this component, see the [5]Apache Oozie 4.2.0 changelog or the
   [6]Apache Oozie project homepage.
