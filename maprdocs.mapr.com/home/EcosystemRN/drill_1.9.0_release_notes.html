Drill 1.9.0 Release Notes

   The following release notes apply to the 1.9.0 version of the Apache
   Drill component included in the MapR Converged Data Platform.
   Version 1.9.0
   Release Date December 9, 2016
   MapR Version Interoperability MapR Drill 1.9.0 is certified on the MapR
   v5.1.0 and v5.2.0 Converged Data Platform. See [1]Interoperability
   Matrix and [2]Drill Support Matrix.
   Packages See [3]Package Names for MapR Expansion Packs (MEPs)

Noteworthy New Features in the MapR Distribution of Drill

   This release provides enhanced query improvements with the following
   bug fixes and improvements:
     * The [4]Asynchronous Parquet Reader improves the performance of the
       Parquet Scan operator by increasing the speed at which the Parquet
       reader scans, decompresses, and decodes data. This feature is
       disabled by default.
     * [5]Parquet Filter Pushdown optimizes the performance by pruning
       extraneous data from a Parquet file to reduce the amount of data
       that Drill scans and reads when a query on a Parquet file contains
       a filter expression.
     * [6]Dynamic UDFs enable users to register and unregister UDFs in a
       muti-tenant environment using the new CREATE FUNCTION USING JAR and
       DROP FUNCTION USING JAR commands.
     * Support for a variety of JOIN syntax generated by Tableau and other
       BI tools, including joins between tables with NULL column values.
     * HTTPD Format Plugin adds the capability to query HTTP web server
       logs natively and also includes parse_url() and parse_query() UDFs
       that return maps of the URL and the query string.

   Additional bug fixes and enhancements listed in the [7]Apache Drill
   1.9.0 Release Notes.

Default Configuration Changes

   The default value for the store.parquet.block-size parameter is now
   268435456 (256MB), the same size as MapR-FS chunk sizes. Prior to this
   release, the default value was 536870912 (512 MB).

   The planner.enable_limit0_optimization parameter is now enabled by
   default to optimize limit0 queries. Prior to this release, the option
   was disabled by default.

   You can modify parameter values using the [8]ALTER SYSTEM|SESSION
   command.

Resolved Issues

   The following table lists resolved issues in Drill 1.9.0:
   Issue Description
   MD-1217 When you use the JDBC URL format for a direct Drillbit
   connection, the driver can now shuffle between the Drillbits listed in
   the connection string instead of always selecting the first Drillbit
   listed.
   MD-1163 The avgwidth stat for the timestamp data type (int64) is now 8
   instead of 4 bytes.
   MD-540 Query profiles now include the session options used for a query.

Known Issues

   The following table lists the known issues in Drill 1.9.0:
   Issue Description
   MD-1256 The MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION variable in drill-env.sh needs to
   be unset so that a user other than the mapr user can connect to Drill
   through SQLLine and MapR-SASL.
   MD-1229 Hive table partition pruning does not prune out all unnecessary
   partitions in some scenarios.
   MD-1226 MapR-SASL plain authentication goes through Kerberos, by
   default, requiring regular users to have a valid Kerberos ticket when
   connecting to Drill using SQLLine through ZooKeeper.
   MD-1208 Parquet filter pushdown does not prune enough partitions in
   queries where the predicate contains the TIME data type.

Limitations
