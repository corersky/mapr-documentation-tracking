   to re-open the directory that contains the table.

Known Issues

     * MapR-18668: Hue does not work on RedHat/CentOS 7 when it is
       configured to use a MySQL database.
       Workaround:
         1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the Redhat 6
            compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d- -f2)/rhel7-am
d64/rpms/MariaDB-5.5.41-centos7_0-x86_64-compat.rpm
         2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus
            SASL library:
ln -s /lib64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /lib64/libsasl2.so.2
         3. Run the following command to reconfigure Hue:
bash -c "./opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.8.1/build/env/bin/activate; /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.8.
1/build/env/bin/hue syncdb --noinput; /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.8.1/build/env/bin/hue
migrate"
         4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <space separated list of
hostnames>
