   not work on Suse 12.1

Known Issues and Limitations

     * Impersonation is not supported for Kafka REST Proxy for MapR
       Streams. Kafka REST is run as mapr user which means that you must
       explicitly give mapr user permissions to consume and produce
       from/to streams. For example, the consumeperm parameter must be set
       to mapr user to be able to consume and the produceperm parameter
       must be set to mapr user to be able to produce.
