Known Issues and Limitations

     * MapR does not support the integration between Hue 3.9.0 and the
       following components:
          + Sentry 1.4
          + Solr Search
          + ZooKeeper
     * Integration between Hue 3.9.0 and Sentry 1.6 is supported on secure
       clusters that use Kerberos authentication, but it is not supported
       on secure clusters that use MapR-SASL authentication.
     * Spark is available as a beta feature. R with Spark 1.3.1 and 1.4.1
       is not supported.
     * Hive SQL only works with Hive 1.2 and Oozie 4.2.0.
     * MAPR-20358: Hive job from Job Designer examples fail on YARN mode
       without the Oozie patch for 2015-10-23:
     * HUE-2673: Hue displays a timeout error when a new session is not
       started within 60 seconds due to the lack of YARN resources.
     * MapR-18668: Hue does not work on RedHat/CentOS 7 when it is
       configured to use a MySQL database. When this issue occurs, the
       MapR Control System (MCS) displays the "Hue Down Alarm." Use this
       workaround:
         1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the RedHat 6
            compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d-
-f2)/rhel7-amd64/rpms/MariaDB-$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d-
-f2)-centos7-x86_64-compat.rpm

         2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus
            SASL library:
ln -s /lib64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /lib64/libsasl2.so.2
         3. Run the following commands to reconfigure Hue:
cd /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.12.0/
source ./build/env/bin/activate
hue syncdb --noinput
hue migrate
deactivate
         4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <node_with_hue>

Resolved Issues

   None.
