   Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   684b09a91 2016-08-18 MAPR-24275: The issue causing a query on hive to
   fail with an IllegalStateException is now fixed.
   4a60eb1db 2016-08-12 MAPR-24248: The isNonLocalScratchDirUsed in
   getLocalScratchDir() method is now set to false to allow operations
   with scratch directories to use the local file system instead of the
   MapR file system.
   e4f49cc398 2016-08-10 HIVE-11617: The issue causing explain job to
   (sometimes) not finish or be very slow when there are many lateral
   views is now fixed.
   3fcf5367 2016-07-16 MAPR-23970: When running a query, checks are now
   included to determine if current file system is non-local before
   running getScratchDir() method, which assumes the file system is not
   local.
   d854ef03 2015-11-03 HIVE-12206: Hive no longer throws an exception when
   Kryo's classloader is set without the UDF jar.
