New in this Release

   This is the initial release of Hive 1.2.1 for the MapR distribution for
   Hadoop. In addition to Hive 1.2.1 features, this release includes the
   following behavior changes and features:
     * HiveServer2 Authentication
       On secure MapR clusters, HiveServer2 uses PAM by default.
     * WebHCat Changes
       The warden.hcat.conf file is no longer installed with mapr-hive
       package. Instead, it is installed with the mapr-hivewebhcat
       package.
     * Cost-Based optimization
       Cost-based optimization is enabled by default.
     * Hive ODBC Driver 2.1.8
       For Hive 1.2.1, use Hive ODBC driver version 2.1.8 or above. This
       driver cannot be installed on CentOS 7.

Hive Feature Support

   MapR does not support Hive on Spark. Therefore, you cannot use Spark as
   an execution engine for Hive. However, you can run Hive and Spark on
   the same cluster and you can use SparkQL to query Hive tables.
