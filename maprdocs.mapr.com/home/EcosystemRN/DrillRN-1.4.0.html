Drill 1.4.0 Release Notes

   The following release notes are for the 1.4.0 version of the Apache
   Drill component included in the MapR distribution for Apache Hadoop.
   Version                       1.4.0
   Release Date                  January 12, 2016
   MapR Version Interoperability See Interoperability Matrix
   Noteworthy New Features in the MapR Distribution of Drill
   This release introduces a number of enhancements, including the
   following ones:
     * Improved Tableau experience with faster Limit 0 queries (MD-602)
     * Metadata (INFORMATION_SCHEMA) query performance improvements on
       Hive schemas/tables (MD-530, MD-504, MD-507, [1]DRILL-4126,
       [2]DRILL-4127, [3]DRILL-4161)
     * Optimized Parquet metadata caching, faster queries on a large
       number of files
       Metadata caching is new feature introduced in [4]Drill 1.2 to speed
       up Drill queries involving large number of files. In 1.4, the cache
       size is considerably reduced using a variety of techniques
       including efficient storage of information as well reducing the
       redundant metadata. This significantly boosts performance of the
       queries. Note however that the depending on the size of data, the
       cache construction might take longer.
     * Partition pruning improvements
       Partition pruning is significantly enhanced in 1.4. The
       enhancements including support for more datatypes, working better
       in conjunction with metadata caching as well as a moving the
       partition pruning evaluation from Hep to Volcano planner.
       ([5]DRILL-4126,[6] DRILL-3765)
     * Improved Window functions resource usage and performance
     * Updated 1.2.1 Windows ODBC driver (updates to Mac and Linux
       versions to follow)
     * New and improved [7]JDBC driver for MapR Drill
       This driver is recommended by MapR for production deployments
       deployments and partner certifications. The new driver offers much
       more compatibility to the JDBC standard. This driver compliments
       the currently available open source version of JDBC driver.
     * Stability improvements
     * 90 bug fixes and additional enhancements listed in [8]Apache Drill
       1.4 Release Notes and [9]Apache Drill 1.3 Release Notes

Known Issues

     * Drill was upgraded to use a new Parquet reader in the Drill 1.3 dev
       preview release. Customers moving from Drill 1.2 and prior versions
       to 1.4 must migrate their data or regenerate their parquet in order
       to continue working with Drill in optimized way. For more
       information on how to upgrade the parquet, refer to the
       [10]migration tool documentation.
     * Merge join in 1.4 has known issues related to performance and data
       correctness in 1.4 ([11]DRILL-3578). Hence, upgrading to 1.4 is not
       recommended for performant queries that use merge joins. If you do
       upgrade to 1.4, you must set the planner.enable_mergejoin option to
       false (that is, use hash join instead); otherwise, merge join
       queries will not run and/or produce incorrect results.
     * Extract function with seconds returns incorrect data when you issue
       queries from the ODBC driver. (MD-604)
     * Complex data functions FLATTEN and KVGEN return null data when you
       issue queries from the ODBC driver. (MD-608)
     * After upgrading to Release 1.4 or later, any custom function you
       wrote in Release 1.3 or earlier that is in a package that Drill
       scans by default will run. However, if you created your own package
       for the custom function, it will not run in Release 1.4 and later.
       You can use one of the following workarounds. The first workaround
       is quick and easy. The second is recommended for new UDFs you
       create in Release 1.4 and later.
       Quick Workaround
         1. Create a drill-module.conf file in $DRILL_HOME/conf/ if one
            does not already exist.
         2. Add the following code to the drill-module.conf, replacing
            com.yourgroupidentifier.udf with the package name(s) of your
            UDFs.
drill.classpath.scanning.packages += "com.yourgroupidentifier.udf"
         3. Copy the drill-module.conf file to all Drillbits.
         4. Ensure that DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-override.conf does not
            contain any information regarding UDF packages.
         5. Restart Drill on all the Drillbits.
       Alternative Workaround
         1. Add the following code to the drill-module.conf in your UDF
            project (src/main/resources/drill-module.conf). Replace
            com.yourgroupidentifier.udf with the package name(s) of your
            UDFs.
drill.classpath.scanning.packages += "com.yourgroupidentifier.udf"
         2. Recompile the UDFs and place the 2 jar files (source + binary)
            in Drill's classpath on all the Drillbits.
         3. Recompile the UDFs and place the 2 jar files (source + binary)
            in Drill's classpath on all the Drillbits.
         4. Restart drill on all the Drillbits.
     * If you upgrade from Drill 1.2 or earlier, update Parquet data.
       Drill 1.4 is the first production ready release after the Drill
       upgrade to use the latest version of the Apache Parquet library,
       which was released in 1.3 dev preview. If you generated Parquet
       using Drill 1.2 and earlier, take one of the following actions:
          + Update data using the [12]Drill migration utility.
          + Regenerate data using the new version of Drill.
       One of these actions is mandatory to continue to get accurate
       functionality and to optimize performance.

Resolved Issues

     * Regardless of whether impersonation is enabled or not, this release
       caches data in the HiveMetaStore to improve performance.
