Spark 2.1.0-1801 Release Notes

   This section provides reference information, including new features,
   patches, and known issues for Spark 2.1.0-1801.

   The notes below relate specifically to the MapR Distribution for Apache
   Hadoop. You may also be interested in the open-source [1]Spark 2.1.0
   Release Notes.
   Spark Version 2.1.0
   Release Date February 2018
   MapR Version Interoperability See [2]MEP Components and OS Support.
   Source on GitHub [3]https://github.com/mapr/spark
   GitHub Release Tag 2.1.0-mapr-1801
   Maven Artifacts [4]http://repository.mapr.com/maven/
   Package Names Navigate to [5]http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/ and
   select your MEP and OS to view the list of package names.
   Important:
     * Full support of MapR Streams is available only on MapR 5.2 and
       later clusters.
     * Spark 2.1 can connect to Hive Metastore 2.1. But, features of Hive
       added after Hive 1.2 are not supported by Spark.
     * Spark Standalone and Spark on YARN can only run on clusters in MRv2
       (YARN) mode. They are not supported on clusters in MRv1 (classic)
       mode.
     * MapR 6.0 and MEP 4.0 and later introduce [6]Built-in Security. If
       you are using these versions and enable security on your MapR
       cluster, MapR scripts automatically configure Spark security
       features.

Hive Support

   This version of Spark supports integration with Hive. However, note the
   following exceptions:
     * Hive-on-Spark is not supported.
     * Spark-SQL is supported, but it is not fully compatible with Hive.
       For details, see the [7]Apache Spark documentation and the [8]MapR
       Spark documentation.

New in This Release

     * Support for Java and Python APIs for MapR-DB OJAI connector. See
       [9]MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark.
