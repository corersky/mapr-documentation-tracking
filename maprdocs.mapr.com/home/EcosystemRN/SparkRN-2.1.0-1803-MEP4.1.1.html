   Important:
     * Spark 2.2 can connect to Hive Metastore 2.1. But, features of Hive
       added after Hive 1.2 are not supported by Spark.
     * Spark Yarn and Standalone modes are supported only on clusters in
       MRv2 (YARN) mode. It is not supported on clusters in MRv1 (classic)
       mode.
     * MapR 6.0 and MEP 4.1 and later introduce [6]built-in security. If
       you are using these versions and enable security on your MapR
       cluster, MapR scripts automatically configure Spark security
       features.

   This version of Spark supports integration with Hive. However, note the
   following exceptions:
     * Hive-on-Spark is not supported.
     * Spark-SQL is supported, but it is not fully compatible with Hive.
       For details, see the [7]Apache Spark documentation and the [8]MapR
       Spark documentation.
