Important Notes

     * MapR does not support the integration between Hue 3.9.0 and the
       following components: Sentry 1.4, Solr Search, and Zookeeper.
       Note: The integration between Hue 3.9.0 and Sentry 1.6 is supported
       on secure clusters that use kerberos authentication, but it is not
       supported on secure clusters that use MapR-SASL authentication.
     * Spark is available as a beta feature. R with Spark 1.3.1 and 1.4.1
       is not supported.
     * Hive SQL example only works with Hive 1.2 and Oozie 4.2.0.

Known Issues

     * MapR-20358: Hive job from Job Designer examples fails on YARN mode
       without Oozie patch for 2015-10-23.
     * HUE-2673: Hue displays a timeout error when a new session is not
       started within 60 seconds due to the lack of YARN resources.
     * MapR-18668: Hue does not work on RedHat/CentOS 7 when it is
       configured to use a MySQL database.
       When this issue occurs, the MapR Control System (MCS) displays the
       "Hue Down Alarm."
       Workaround:
         1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the Redhat 6
            compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d- -f2)/rhel7-am
d64/rpms/MariaDB-$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d- -f2)-centos7-x86_64-compat.rpm
         2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus
            SASL library:
ln -s /usr/lib64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /usr/lib64/libsasl2.so.2
         3. Run the following commands to reconfigure Hue:
source /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.0/build/env/bin/activate
/opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.0/build/env/bin/hue syncdb --noinput
/opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.0/build/env/bin/hue migrate
         4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
