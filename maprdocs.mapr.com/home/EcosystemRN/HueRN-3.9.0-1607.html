yum install mariadb
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/<mariadb_version>/rhel7-amd64/rpms/Mari
aDB-<mariadb_version>-centos7-x86_64-compat.rpm
         2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus
            SASL library:
ln -s /lib64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /lib64/libsasl2.so.2
         3. Run the following command to reconfigure Hue:
bash -c "./opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.0/build/env/bin/activate; /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.
0/build/env/bin/hue
      syncdb --noinput; /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.0/build/env/bin/hue migrate"
         4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
