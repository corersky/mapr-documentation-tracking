Known Issues

   MapR-17229:
          The HBase examples provided in Hue 3.7 will not load in HBase
          0.94.x because HBase 0.94.x uses a different thrift version than
          Hue 3.7.

   MapR-17314:
          When you run Hue 3.7 with a Hadoop version that is less than
          2.5.1, the Job Browser hangs if you attempt to kill running YARN
          applications from the Job Browser window. This issue occurs with
          MapR version 4.0.1 as it uses Hadoop 2.4.1.

   MapR-18668:
          Hue does not work on RedHat/CentOS 7 when it is configured to
          use a MySQL database.

          When this issue occurs, the MapR Control System (MCS) displays
          the "Hue Down Alarm."

          Workaround:

         1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the Redhat 6
            compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d- -f2)/rhel7-am
d64/rpms/MariaDB-5.5.41-centos7_0-x86_64-compat.rpm
         2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus
            SASL library:
ln -s /lib/64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /lib64/libsasl2.so.2
         3. Run the following command to reconfigure Hue:
bash -c "./opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.7.0/build/env/bin/activate; /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.7.
0/build/env/bin/hue syncdb --noinput; /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.7.0/build/env/bin/hue
migrate"
         4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <space separated list of
hostnames>
