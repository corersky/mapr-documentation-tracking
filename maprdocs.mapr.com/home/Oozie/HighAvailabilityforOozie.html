Configure High Availability for Oozie

   To configure HA for Oozie on your cluster, the cluster must meet the
   following prerequisites:
     * Your cluster must have access to a database with support for
       multiple concurrent connections. To prevent this database from
       becoming a single point of failure, the database must support HA.
       HA for the Oozie service works regardless of the databaseâ€™s HA
       status. See [1]MySQL Data Store for Oozie.
     * To prevent the ZooKeeper service from becoming a single point of
       failure, your cluster must have at least 3 ZooKeeper nodes. You can
       still configure HA for Oozie on clusters with a single ZK node.
     * Multiple nodes on the cluster must have Oozie installed. For
       installation instructions, see the [2]Installing MapR and/or MapR
       Ecosystem Components.
       Note: For greater consistency of behavior on your cluster, verify
       that all of the Oozie servers have the same configuration.
     * A load balancer, virtual IP, or round-robin DNS set up, such as
       HAProxy. To prevent the load balancer from becoming a single point
       of failure, the load balancer must support HA.

    1. Verify that the Oozie servers are all configured to connect to the
       same database. Do not start Oozie.
    2. On each Oozie node, edit the oozie-site.xml file to add the
       following section, which changes the results in Oozie using the
       Zookeeper's version of the services, overriding the default
       implementations:
<property>
    <name>oozie.services.ext</name>
    <value>
        org.apache.oozie.service.ZKLocksService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.ZKXLogStreamingService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.ZKJobsConcurrencyService,
        org.apache.oozie.service.ZKUUIDService
    </value>
</property>
    3. On each Oozie node, edit the oozie-site.xml file to include a
       comma-separated list of the host names and ports for the ZooKeeper
       servers. For example:
<property>
     <name>oozie.zookeeper.connection.string</name>
     <value>zk1:5181,zk2:5181,zk3:5181</value>
</property>
    4. On each Oozie node, edit the oozie-site.xml file to specify the
       namespace. Each Oozie server that communicates to other Oozie
       servers must use the same namespace:
<property>
     <name>oozie.zookeeper.namespace</name>
     <value>oozie</value>
</property>
    5. On each Oozie node, change the value of the OOZIE_BASE_URL property
       in the oozie-site.xml file to point to the load balancer or virtual
       IP.
<property>
    <name>oozie.base.url</name>

<value>http://my.loadbalancer.hostname:<oozie_port_number>/oozie</value>
</property>
       The [3]<oozie_port_number> depends on whether your cluster is
       secure.
    6. (Optional) On each Oozie node, change the value of the
       OOZIE_INSTANCE_ID property in the oozie-env.sh file to make the
       instance ID of each Oozie server unique. The default value for this
       property is ${OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME}.
       export OOZIE_INSTANCE_ID="${OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME}"
    7. On all nodes, update the services line in warden.oozie.conf (stored
       in /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d) from:
services=oozie:1:cldb
       to
services=oozie:all:cldb
    8. Start the Oozie servers. See [4]Starting and Stopping Oozie
       Services.
    9. Run Oozie share lib update command to make sure that all Oozie
       services use the latest and the same version:
{OOZIE_HOME}/bin/oozie admin -sharelibupdate
