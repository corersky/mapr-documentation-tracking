Starting and Stopping Oozie Services

   The Warden daemon starts the Oozie server automatically at installation
   time. You can start and stop Oozie from the command line or from the
   MapR Control System. Using the maprcli node services command enables
   you to start Oozie on multiple nodes at one time.

   Starting and Stopping Oozie using maprcli

   Complete the following steps to start|stop Oozie from the command line:
    1. Make a list of nodes on which Oozie is configured.
    2. Issue the maprcli node services command with either start or stop,
       and specify the nodes on which Oozie is configured, separated by
       spaces.
       Example:
maprcli node services -name oozie -action start -nodes node001 node002 node003
maprcli node services -name oozie -action stop -nodes node001 node002 node003

   Starting and Stopping Oozie from the MapR Control System

   Complete the following steps to start|stop Oozie from the MCS:
    1. In the Navigation pane, expand the Cluster Views pane and click
       Dashboard.
    2. In the Services pane, click Oozie to open the Nodes screen
       displaying all the nodes on which Oozie is configured.
    3. On the Nodes screen, click the hostname of each node to display its
       Node Properties screen.
    4. On each Node Properties screen, use the Stop|Start button in the
       Oozie row under Manage Services to start Oozie.
