User Impersonation for Oozie

   Oozie supports impersonation, which enables Oozie to run jobs as a user
   other than the user that started the Oozie server. You can set up proxy
   user functionality if you want Oozie to impersonate a user from a set
   of hosts, or to impersonate a user that belongs to a set of groups.
   When you configure proxy user functionality, the proxy user can perform
   “doAs” operations. Add configuration properties to the oozie-site.xml
   and core-site.xml files to configure proxy user functionality.

   Add the following configuration properties to the oozie-site.xml file:
     * oozie.service.ProxyUserService.proxyuser.#USER#.hosts
     * oozie.service.ProxyUserService.proxyuser.#USER#.groups

   Replace #USER# with the username of the proxy that can perform “doAs”
   operations. For the host property, you can add a list of host names as
   the value. For the group property, you can add a list of groups as the
   value. Alternatively, you can add a wildcard character (*) as the value
   for host and group properties. To add multiple users, copy the property
   and replace #USER# with the proxy user name.
   Host Example
<property>
        <name>oozie.service.ProxyUserService.proxyuser.mapr.hosts</name>
        <value>*</value>
</property>

   Group Example
<property>
        <name>oozie.service.ProxyUserService.proxyuser.mapr.groups</name>
        <value>*</value>
</property>

   Add the following configuration properties to the core-site.xml:
     * hadoop.proxyuser.#USER#.hosts
     * hadoop.proxyuser.#USER#.groups

   Replace #USER# with the username of the proxy.

   When you add the host property, the proxy user can only connect from a
   host to impersonate a user. When you add the group property, the proxy
   user can impersonate any member of any group.
   Host Example
<property>
    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.mapr.hosts</name>
    <value>*</value>
</property>

   Group Example
<property>
    <name>hadoop.proxyuser.mapr.groups</name>
    <value>*</value>
</property>
