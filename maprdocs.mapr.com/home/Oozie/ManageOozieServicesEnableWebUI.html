Enabling the Oozie Web UI

   The Oozie web UI can display your job status, logs, and other related
   information. You must enable the Oozie Web UI after you install Oozie.
   However, depending on how you enable the Web UI, you may also need to
   perform manual steps to start the Web UI after you run configure.sh on
   the cluster.
    1. Download the Ext JS 2.2 library as a zip archive (ext-2.2.zip). You
       can download this library from the [1]Apache Oozie Quick Start
       guide. Search for "ExtJS 2.2" on the page to find the link.
       Note: The Ext JS 2.2 library is required only for the Oozie Web UI.
       A [2]rewrite of the Oozie web UI has been proposed in the Oozie
       user community.
    2. Copy the Ext JS 2.2 library into the libext directory:
cp ext-2.2.zip /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/libext/
    3. Perform one of the following options based on your preference:
          + If you want the Oozie Web UI to start whenever Oozie starts or
            restarts, perform the following steps:
              a. If Oozie is running, shut it down:
maprcli node services -name oozie -action stop -nodes <space delimited list of n
odes>
              b. Run the oozie-setup.sh script, and specify the hadoop
                 version.
/opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/bin/oozie-setup.sh -hadoop <version> /opt/mapr/h
adoop/hadoop-<version>
          + If you want to manually start the Web UI when Oozie starts or
            restarts, perform the following steps:
              a. If Oozie is running, shut it down:
maprcli node services -name oozie -action stop -nodes <space delimited list of n
odes>
              b. Run the oozie-setup.sh script and specify the path to the
                 extjs file.
cd /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>
bin/oozie-setup.sh prepare-war -extjs ~/ext-2.2.zip
    4. Start Oozie.
maprcli node services -name oozie -action start -nodes <space delimited list of
nodes>
