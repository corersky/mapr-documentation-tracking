Flume

   [flume_logo.jpg]

   Apache Flumeâ„¢ is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
   efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log
   data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming data
   flows. It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability
   mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. It uses a simple
   extensible data model that allows for online analytic application.

   This section provides information about installing, configuring, and
   using Flume with MapR, but does not duplicate Apache documentation. You
   can refer also to documentation available from the [1]Apache Flume
   Project and the [2]Flume Release Notes for MapR.
