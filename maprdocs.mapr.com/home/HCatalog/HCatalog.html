HCatalog

   HCatalog is a table and storage management layer for Hadoop that
   enables users with different data processing tools — Pig, MapReduce —
   to more easily read and write data on the grid. HCatalog’s table
   abstraction presents users with a relational view of data in the Hadoop
   distributed file system (HDFS) and ensures that users need not worry
   about where or in what format their data is stored — RCFile format,
   text files, SequenceFiles, or ORC files.

   HCatalog supports reading and writing files in any format for which a
   SerDe (serializer-deserializer) can be written. By default, HCatalog
   supports RCFile, CSV, JSON, and SequenceFile, and ORC file formats. To
   use a custom format, you must provide the InputFormat, OutputFormat,
   and SerDe.

   HCatalog is also automatically installed and upgraded along with Hive.
   For information about using HCatalog with Hive, see [1]Hive and WebHCat
   Integration and [2]Hive and HCatalog Integration.
