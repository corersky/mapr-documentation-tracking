MapR Sandbox for Hadoop

   The MapR Sandbox for Hadoop is a fully-functional single-node cluster
   that gently introduces business analysts, current and aspiring Hadoop
   developers, and administrators (database, system, and Hadoop) to the
   big data promises of Hadoop and its ecosystem.

   Use the sandbox to experiment with Hadoop technologies using the MapR
   Control System (MCS) and Hue.

   Hadoop administrators can launch the MCS and use [1]tutorials to
   configure, monitor, and manage a cluster.

   Hadoop developers or analysts, looking to gain an understanding of
   Hadoop and MapR, can:
     * Launch the Hue interface.
     * Use the [2]tutorials to perform tasks with the provided Hue
       applications.
     * Explore solutions to use cases.
     * Run jobs on data in the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop.

   To use the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop:
     * Verify that the host system meets the prerequisites listed below.
     * Download, import, and run the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop, as described
       in [3]Installing the Sandbox on VMware Player or VMware Fusion or
       in [4]Installing the Sandbox on VirtualBox.

Prerequisites

   Before you install the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop, verify that the host
   system meets the following prerequisites:
     * A supported virtual machine player is installed. The MapR Sandbox
       for Hadoop runs on the following virtual machine players installed
       on Windows, Mac, or Linux PCs:
          + [5]VMware Workstation Player (version 12)
          + [6]VMware Fusion (version 8)
          + [7]VirtualBox (version 5.1.22 and later)
          + Note: Use of the virtual machine players is subject to the end
            user license terms for each player. By downloading and using
            the virtual machine players, you agree to the terms and
            conditions.
     * At least 20 GB free hard disk space, at least 4 physical cores, and
       8 GB of RAM is available. Performance increases with more RAM and
       free hard disk space.
     * Uses one of the following 64-bit x86 architectures:
          + A 1.3 GHz or faster AMD CPU with segment-limit support in long
            mode
          + A 1.3 GHz or faster Intel CPU with VT-x support
     * If you have an Intel CPU with VT-x support, verify that VT-x
       support is enabled in the host system BIOS. The BIOS settings that
       must be enabled for VT-x support vary depending on the system
       vendor. See the VMware knowledge base article at
       [8]http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003944 for information about how to
       determine if VT-x support is enabled.
