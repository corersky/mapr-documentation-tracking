Installing the Sandbox on VirtualBox

   Download the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop and import the virtual machine
   into VirtualBox. Configure the network setting, and start the MapR
   Sandbox for Hadoop to access the MapR Control System and Hue
   interfaces.
   Note: The MapR Sandbox for Hadoop on VirtualBox comes with NAT ports
   forwarded to localhost.

   Complete the following steps to install and run the MapR Sandbox for
   Hadoop:
    1. Download the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop file to a directory on your
       machine. To access the file, go to
       [1]http://package.mapr.com/releases/, and select the directory for
       the latest MapR release. The file is located in the sandbox/
       directory for the release, as shown:
[2]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v6.0.1/sandbox/MapR-Sandbox-For-Hadoop-6.0.1
.ova
    2. Open VirtualBox, and select File > Import Appliance. The Import
       Appliance window appears.
    3. Go to the directory where you downloaded the MapR Sandbox for
       Hadoop file, select the MapR-Sandbox-For-Hadoop-<version>.ova file,
       and click Next. The Import Virtual Appliance window appears.
    4. In the Import Virtual Appliance window, select the option to
       Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards and then click
       Import. The Import Appliance imports the sandbox.
    5. When the import completes, select the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop and
       then click Settings. The Settings window appears.
    6. In the Settings window, select Network. The correct setting depends
       on your network connectivity when you run the sandbox. In general,
       if you are going to use a wired Ethernet connection, select NAT
       Network. If you use ODBC or JDBC on a remote host, select Bridged
       Adapter. If you are going to use a wireless network, select
       Host-only Adapter or Bridged Adapter with the Intel(R) Dual Band
       Wireless-AC 8260 option.
    7. Click OK to continue.
    8. Select the MapR-Sandbox-For-Hadoop-<version> in VirtualBox, and
       click Start.
    9. When you see maprdemo login:_ prompt, enter mapr and then enter
       mapr as the password.
       The message, Welcome to your MapR Demo virtual machine, appears.
   10. Verify that a DNS entry was created on the host machine for the
       virtual machine. If not, create the entry.
          + For Linux and Mac, create the entry in /etc/hosts.
          + For Windows, create the entry in the
            %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file. You may need to run
            an editor, such as Notepad, as the administrator to edit and
            save the hosts file on Windows.
       Example: 127.0.0.1 maprdemo
   11. Enter the following URLs in your browser's address bar to access
       the Hue and MapR Control System interfaces, and enter mapr as the
       username and password:
          + MapR Control System - Enter https://localhost:8443 or
            https://127.0.0.1:8443 in the address bar.
            Note: If you encounter a warning message stating that your
            connection is not private, select the option to accept and
            continue to the MapR Control System.
          + Hue - Enter http://localhost:8888 or http://127.0.0.1:8443 in
            the address bar.
            Note: If you used a bridged adapter, the network generates and
            assigns an IP to the sandbox that you must use in place of
            127.0.0.1 or localhost. To get the IP address, log in to the
            sandbox, using Alt+F2 on Windows or Option+F5 on Mac or Linux.
            Enter root as the username and mapr as the password. Enter
            ifconfig to get the sandbox IP address. The IP address is
            located in the inet address field. You can access the MCS and
            Hue interfaces using the IP address, as shown in the following
            examples:
               o MCS - https://192.168.1.104:8443
               o Hue - http://192.168.1.104:8888
       Alternatively, you can access the host via SSH using ssh
       mapr@localhost -p 2222.
