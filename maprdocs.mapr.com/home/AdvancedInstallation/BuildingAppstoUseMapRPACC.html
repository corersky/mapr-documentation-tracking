Writing Applications to Use the MapR PACC

   This section describes a number of resources for developing
   applications to use the MapR PACC.

   Developing applications to use the MapR PACC is the same as developing
   applications on other MapR-supported platforms. To get started, see
   these topics:
     * [1]MapR-FS and Applications
     * [2]MapR-DB and Applications
     * [3]MapR-ES and Applications

   To build a container for your application that can leverage MapR
   Converged Data Platform services, you will create a Dockerfile
   referencing the MapR PACC which installs your application and its
   dependencies. You can then build and launch your application using the
   same runtime variables described later in this section.
