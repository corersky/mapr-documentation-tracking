What Happens During Azure Deployment

   The primary reference template for Azure (mainTemplate.json) is a
   starting point for all the child templates that create Azure resources.
   When the primary template is deployed, some resources are created in
   parallel. Here is what happens in a typical deployment:
    1. The primary template is deployed.
    2. If the option to create a new network was selected, the
       MapR.Network.Template is deployed.
    3. MapR.Network.Template creates the virtual network and subnet(s).
    4. MapR.VM.Template and, optionally, the MapR.OpenVPN.Template are
       started in parallel.
    5. MapR.VM.Template creates all the resources needed to install and
       run MapR software. The number of resources varies depending on the
       Node Count you selected. This process creates:
          + Virtual machines
          + Network interfaces
          + Managed disks
       After these resources are completely created, the MapR installation
       starts via Stanza.
    6. MapR.OpenVPN.Template creates one virtual machine, network
       interface, and managed disk. This Ubuntu machine has the OpenVPN
       server installed via script after these resources are completely
       created.
