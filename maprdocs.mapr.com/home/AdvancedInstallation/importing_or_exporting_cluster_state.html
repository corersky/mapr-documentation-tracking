Importing or Exporting the Cluster State

   You can use the Import State and Export State commands to upload or
   download a YAML configuration file (a "Stanza") that describes the
   state of the cluster.

   In the web-based MapR Installer, the Import State and Export State
   commands can be useful if you encounter a failure while using the
   installer and you want to revert to a previous cluster state.
   You can access these commands from the Support menu at the top of the
   MapR Installer user interface. For more information about using MapR
   Installer Stanza files, see [1]MapR Installer Stanzas.
   Import State Opens the Cluster State dialog box, which enables you to
   reset the cluster to the last known state or to a desired state
   recorded in a YAML configuration file that you specify. You can use the
   Import State command at any time.
   Export State Downloads a YAML file capturing the current state of the
   cluster. You can use the Export State command at any time.

   To import the cluster state, follow these steps:
    1. Using a browser, log in to the MapR Installer:
https://<Installer Node hostname/Ipaddress>:9443
       For more information about the MapR Installer, see [2]MapR
       Installer.
    2. Click Support > Import State. The Cluster State dialog box appears.
    3. Chose one of the following options:
          + Click Reset to revert the cluster to the last known state.
            (After a successful installation or Incremental Install using
            the MapR Installer or Stanzas, the last known state of the
            cluster is saved to
            /opt/mapr/installer/data/last_known_state.yaml.)
          + Click Choose File, select a YAML file, and then click Reset to
            load the YAML file.

   To export the cluster state, follow these steps:
    1. Using a browser, log in to the MapR Installer:
https://<Installer Node hostname/Ipaddress>:9443
       For more information about the MapR Installer, see [3]MapR
       Installer.
    2. Click Support > Export State.
       The cluster state is downloaded as stanza.yaml.
