Applying a Patch Manually

   MapR patches are version-specific and cumulative. Each patch contains
   the code fixes that were included in the previous patch for that MapR
   version.

   MapR version-specific patches are available here:
   http://package.mapr.com/patches/releases/.
   Note: You can also apply a patch using the MapR Installer. See
   [1]Applying a Patch Using the MapR Installer.

   Applying a patch is a 3 step process:
   [2][USEMAP:patch_install_steps.png]

   When you apply a patch to the cluster, the patched files along with
   original files (non-patched) are copied to the /opt/mapr/.patch folder.
   In the /opt/mapr/.patch folder, the file ending with .O is the original
   file (non-patched) and the file ending with .<patch_number> is the
   patched version. Therefore, if there is a file under
   /opt/mapr/.patch/lib/, you can compare that with the corresponding file
   under /opt/mapr/lib/ by using the md5sum command to verify that the
   patch was successfully deployed.
   Note: A patch for a given software version can be removed, and an older
   patch for the same MapR software version can be installed. However,
   rolling back a cluster from a newer MapR version to an older version is
   not supported
   For information on the bugs fixed in the patch:
     * Go to the MapR Customer Support web portal at
       [3]www.mapr.com/support. After logging into the portal, click the
       "Patches" tab and choose the appropriate MapR version to view the
       list of bug fixes. You will then see the patch name for the fixes
       displayed.
     * View a copy of the latest [4]Patch Release Notes.

   Contact support@mapr.com if you need more information or if you face
   any problems with patch installation.
