Step 10: Install Ecosystem Components Manually

   You can install one or more ecosystem components from any MapR
   Expansion Pack (MEP) that is supported by the MapR cluster version. A
   MEP consists of a group of ecosystem components that work together.

Prerequisite: Set up the MEP Repository

   Complete the following steps on each node in the cluster:
    1. Verify that each node can access the ecosystem packages associated
       with the MEP version that you want to install. For information
       about how to set up the ecosystem repositories or to manually
       download each package, see [1]Step 2: Prepare Packages and
       Repositories.
    2. Update the repository cache to get the latest list of available
       packages:
          + On RedHat/CentOS:
# yum clean all
          + On SUSE:
# zypper refresh
          + On Ubuntu:
# apt-get update

Manually Install Ecosystem Components

   Review the [2]MapR Expansion Pack Release Notes to determine the list
   of ecosystem components available in the MEP that you have selected.
   Then, complete the installation steps for each component that you want
   to install.
   Note: If you want to use the optional [3]OJAI Distributed Query
   Service, you must install Drill. See [4]Installing Drill.
