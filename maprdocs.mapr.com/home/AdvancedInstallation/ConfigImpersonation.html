Configuring Impersonation

   Impersonation, also known as identity assertion, is one user (the mapr
   super user) accessing data and submitting jobs on behalf of another
   user.
   Note: Only the mapr user can impersonate other users.

   For secure clusters, to have a request processed as an impersonated
   user:
    1. The user submitting the request must be the mapr user and the
       request should have the HTTP header X-MAPR-IMPERSONATED-USER,
       passed in the request.
       The value of the header is the username of the impersonated user.
    2. The header must also include "Authorization: Basic
       <base64_encoding_of_userID:pwd>" for the apiserver to authorize the
       request.
       Here userID is mapr and the password is the PAM Linux password for
       mapr user on the node on which the apiserver is running.

   For example:
curl -XPOST -H "Accept: application/json" -H  "X-MAPR-IMPERSONATED-USER: m7user1
" -H "Authorization: Basic bWFwcjptYXBy" -k https://10.20.30.40:8443/rest/table/
create?path=%2Ftmp%2FsrcC -v

   For non-secure cluster, MapR requires a file for the user to
   impersonate in /opt/mapr/conf/proxy directory. The logged-in user is
   allowed to impersonate only if the
   /opt/mapr/conf/proxy/<user_to_impersonate> file is present. By default,
   this file is created during installation for mapr user and root user.
   If the file is not present, HTTP 403 is returned to the client if the
   client attempts to impersonate a user who does not have the file.
