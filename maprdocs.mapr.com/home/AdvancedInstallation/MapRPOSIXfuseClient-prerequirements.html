Preparing for Installation

   In order to install the MapR POSIX Client on a node, you must meet
   certain requirements.

   The MapR POSIX client can be installed on any node if you have Linux
   installed. You cannot install the MapR POSIX client on a Windows or Mac
   OS X machine. This client requires Java (1.7 or higher) already
   installed on your system.

POSIX Client Package and License Terms

   With this release, MapR provides two separate POSIX client packages,
   each with different licensing terms and performance tiers. Each package
   implies a specific MapR filesystem throughput optimization of n/G per
   second. These clients can be installed and used according to the same
   principles as the POSIX loopback NFS client. The table below lists the
   packages and their license type/terms.

Client-side Hardware Requirements

   For installing the POSIX client, your hardware must meet the following
   requirements:
                                       Basic           Platinum
   Hyper-threading                    Off      Off
   Physical CPU(s) (with HT disabled) 1        2
   Thread(s) per core                 1        1
   Core(s) per socket                 8        8

   NICs                               10 Gbps  40 Gbps NICS (dual port)
   Note: Disabling hyper-threading (HT) will improve performance.

Linux Kernel Tuning Recommendations

   If the client connects to the servers over a 40GigE switch, it is
   recommended to set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf to 16MB
   on all the nodes for maximum throughput.
   Note: This setting is not required, but if the network has a large
   capacity, this setting allows the OS to buffer large chunks of data for
   transmission improving throughput.
