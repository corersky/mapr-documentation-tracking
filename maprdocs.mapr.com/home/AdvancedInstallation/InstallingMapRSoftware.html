Installing without the MapR Installer

   Describes how to install MapR software and ecosystem components
   manually.

   These steps describe how to install a secure MapR cluster. If your
   cluster does not need to be secure, you can still use this procedure
   and skip over the steps indicated for security.

   After you have planned the cluster and prepared each node, you can
   install the MapR distribution from the MapR repository or package
   files. Installing MapR requires that you perform certain steps on each
   node. You can install Apache Ecosystem components, such as Hive, after
   you bring up the cluster.
   Warning: Before you install, make sure that all nodes meet the
   requirements for installation. See [1]Preparing each Node for more
   information. Failure to prepare nodes is the primary cause of
   installation problems.

   You must also make sure that the [2]MapR Installer package dependencies
   are installed. These packages are downloaded for you when you use the
   MapR Installer, but must be installed manually before you install
   without using the MapR Installer.

   You must also have the following information from your cluster plan
   when you install:
     * A list of the hostnames (or IP addresses) for all nodes and the
       services that you want to run on each node.
     * A list of all disks and/or partitions to use on each node.

   Note: For information about repositories and packages for MapR software
   and Hadoop Ecosystem tools, see [3]MapR Repositories and Packages.

   To successfully install MapR, complete each step described in
   subsequent sections.
