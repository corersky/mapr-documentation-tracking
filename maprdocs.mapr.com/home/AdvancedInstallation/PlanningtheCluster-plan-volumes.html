Plan Initial Volumes

   This section describes why it is important to define volumes.

   MapR manages the data in a cluster in a set of volumes. Volumes can be
   mounted in the Linux filesystem in a hierarchical directory structure,
   but volumes do not contain other volumes. Each volume has its own
   policies and other settings, so it is important to define a number of
   volumes in order to segregate and classify your data.

   Plan to define volumes for each user, for each project, and so on. For
   streaming data, you might plan to create a new volume to store new data
   every day or week or month. The more volume granularity, the easier it
   is to specify backup or other policies for subsets of the data. For
   more information on volumes, see [1]Managing Data with Volumes.
