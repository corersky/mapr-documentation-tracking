Installing Myriad

   Describes Myriad requirements and installation.

   The following table specifies the Myriad installation requirements.

   CAPTION: Table 1. Myriad Installation Requirements

          Requirement        Description
   Operating Systems
     * RedHat/CentOS 6.2, 6.6, and 7.0
     * Ubuntu 14.04

   Myriad Requirements
     * JDK 7 or 8

   MapR Minimum Requirements
     * MapR Core
     * MapR Zookeeper
     * MapR CLDB
     * MapR FileServer
     * MapR Webserver

   The following table specifies the ports used by Myriad.

   CAPTION: Table 2. Ports Used

   Application Port
   Mesos Master UI http://<hostname>:5050
   Marathon UI http://<hostname>:8080
   Myriad UI http://<hostname>:8192
   Note: The Myriad UI is available once a Resource Manager is launched.
   Note: If your environment has both Marathon and Spark installed on the
   same node, a conflict occurs because the default port for both is 8080.
   To resolve this conflict, change the port for one of the applications.

   The Myriad installation is a manual installation where Apache Mesos is
   installed before MapR Myriad.
    1. Download and build Mesos and (optionally) Marathon. See
       [1]http://mesos.apache.org/getting-started/ for Mesos and
       [2]https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/ for Marathon.
       Important: Install Apache Mesos on all node where resources will be
       shared. In addition, at least one (1) node should be running both
       Master and Slave and one (1) node running only Slaves.
    2. Download and deploy MapR Myriad.
         a. Download the Myriad 0.2 tarball. See [3]Myriad 0.2-1710
            Release Notes for more information.
         b. Extract Myriad from the tarball.
tar -zxf mapr-myriad-0.2.tar.gz
         c. Deploy Myriad and configuration files.
mkdir -p /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-{HADOOP_VERSION}/share/hadoop/myriad/lib
ln -sf {PROJECT_HOME}/libs/* {HADOOP_HOME}/share/hadoop/myriad/lib
ln -sf {PROJECT_HOME}/conf/* {HADOOP_HOME}/etc/hadoop/
    3. On the Mesos master node, install (as a minimum) Apache Mesos and
       the following MapR packages:
mapr-core
mapr-fileserver
mapr-cldb
mapr-webserver

        On RedHat / CentOS

yum -nogpgcheck install <package> <package>  ...

        On Ubuntu

apt-get install  <package> <package> ...

    4. Install MapR Zookeeper on its master node:
       The MapR mapr-zookeeper package can be installed on any node that
       is designated as its master. For example, on the Mesos master node:
mapr-zookeeper
    5. (optional) Install Mesos-DNS on its master node:
       Mesos-DNS can be installed on any node that is designated as its
       master. For example, on the Mesos master node. See
       [4]https://mesosphere.github.io/mesos-dns/docs/
    6. On the Mesos slave nodes, install (as a minimum) Apache Mesos and
       the following MapR packages.
mapr-core
mapr-fileserver

Small Cluster Installation

   The following example shows an installation on a CentOS6 operating
   system, a three (3) node cluster where one node is the master node for
   Mesos, Mesos-DNS, MaprR CLDB, and MapR Zookeeper, and two nodes are
   Mesos slave nodes.

   Download and build Mesos on all nodes.

   Unpack and install Myriad from the tarball.

   On the master node, install (as a minimum) Apache Mesos and the
   following MapR packages:
yum -nogpgcheck install
mapr-core mapr-fileserver mapr-zookeeper mapr-cldb mapr-webserver

   On the two Mesos slave nodes, install (as a minimum) Apache Mesos and
   the following MapR packages:
yum -nogpgcheck install
mapr-core mapr-fileserver

   See [5]Configure Myriad.
