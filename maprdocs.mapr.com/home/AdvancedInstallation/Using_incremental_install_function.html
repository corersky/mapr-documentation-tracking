Using the Incremental Install Function

   Use the Incremental Install function of the web-based MapR Installer to
   control MapR security, add or upgrade services, upgrade MapR Expansion
   Packs (MEPs), and perform other maintenance functions.

Things You Can Do Using the Incremental Install

   Using the Incremental Install function, you can:
     * Enable or disable security by using the Enable MapR Secure Cluster
       option
     * Add services that are supported for your current MEP
     * Apply a patch
     * Delete a service from a cluster by deselecting the service
     * Upgrade the MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) to upgrade your services
     * Change a [1]2-digit MEP to the equivalent 3-digit MEP

   Note: Before enabling security using the Incremental Install function,
   be sure to review the known issue (IN-1084) related to custom
   certificates. See [2]MapR Installer Known Issues.
   You cannot perform the following functions using an Incremental
   Install:
     * Add a node to a cluster
     * Delete a node from a cluster
     * Upgrade the MapR Core version

Online Versus Offline Operations

   Most Incremental Install operations are performed online. However,
   applying a patch or selecting or deselecting the Enable MapR Secure
   Cluster option are offline operations. See [3]Using the Enable MapR
   Secure Cluster Option. Making a change to security requires the MapR
   Installer to stop the Warden and Zookeeper services, bringing the
   cluster offline temporarily.

Using Incremental Install

    1. Using a browser, log in to the MapR Installer:
https://<Installer Node hostname/Ipaddress>:9443
    2. Click the Incremental Install button. The Version & Services page
       appears.
    3. Make the desired changes to add or remove security, add or delete
       services, apply a patch, or upgrade the MEP. Then click Next.
    4. Advance through the MapR Installer screens, providing the admin
       password or other information as needed.
    5. After the Incremental Install finishes, if you added services, use
       the MCS Services tab or the maprcli service list -node command to
       ensure that the services are running. If the services are not
       running, you might need to restart the nodes. For more information,
       see IN-1332 in [4]MapR Installer Known Issues.
