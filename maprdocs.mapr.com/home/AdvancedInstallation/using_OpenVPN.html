Using OpenVPN

   You can use OpenVPN to create a secure tunnel between your workstation
   and the private subnet for the MapR cluster.

Using OpenVPN with AWS

   To download the OpenVPN desktop client:
    1. On the Outputs tab, and copy the OpenVPNUrl. For example:
https://52.14.236.170:943/admin
    2. Paste the URL into a browser, but remove the admin. For example:
https://52.14.236.170:943/
       OpenVPN displays download links for the OpenVPN Connect app.
    3. Click the appropriate link to download the app for your
       workstation. You need to do this only once.

   To connect to the cluster using OpenVPN:
    1. Use the OpenVPN Connect command to display the Login screen.
    2. In the Server field, paste the OpenVPNIp value from the Outputs
       tab.
    3. In the Username and Password fields, enter the OpenVPN username and
       password you specified in the reference template.

Using OpenVPN with Azure

   For Azure clusters, OpenVPN uses the supplied Azure admin username and
   password. You can find the Open VPN IP address on the ARM template
   deployment output page:
    1. Navigate to https://<openvpn ip>:943.
    2. Log in with the Azure admin username and password.
    3. Download and install the OpenVPN client for your platform.

    2. Enter the VPN IP address displayed on the template deployment
       output page.
    3. Log in with the user name and password you entered while creating
       your resource group.
