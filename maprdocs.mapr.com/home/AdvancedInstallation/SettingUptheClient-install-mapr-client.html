Installing the MapR Client

   This section describes how to prepare your machine for the installation
   process.
   Before you install the MapR Client, perform the following steps:
     * Verify that the operating system on the machine where you plan to
       install the MapRClient is supported. For a list of operating
       systems that are compatible with the MapR clients, see [1]MapR
       Client Support Matrix.
     * Verify that the machine where you plan to install the MapR client
       is not a cluster node. The MapR client is intended for use on a
       computer that has no other MapR server software installed.
     * Obtain connectivity information and cluster setup requirements.
       When you use configure.sh to configure the client, you will need to
       know the following details:
          + The cluster name. You will need the cluster name when you
            specify the -N parameter.
          + The IP addresses and ports of the CLDB nodes on the cluster.
            You will need this information when you specify the CLDB nodes
            with the -C parameter.
          + If one or more nodes in the cluster run the ResourceManager,
            you may need to specify the hostname or IP address for each
            ResourceManager nodes using the -RM parameter. If the cluster
            is configured to use zero-configuration failover, do not
            specify the ResourceManager nodes. If the cluster is not
            configured to use zero-configuration failover, specify each
            ResourceManager node.
          + Determine if the cluster is secure. If the cluster is secure,
            you will need to specify the -secure parameter when you run
            configure.sh.
          + If a node in the cluster runs the HistoryServer, note the
            hostname for the HistoryServer. You must specify each
            HistoryServer node using the -HS parameter.
     * In the /etc/hosts file of the client machine, add a mapping between
       the CLDB nodes in the cluster and the IP addresses of those nodes.
       For example, add the IP address 10.10.82.22 and CLDB node name
       centos22 on the Mac OSX where you installed the client:
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
fe80::1%lo0     localhost
10.10.82.22     centos22

   To install the MapR client, obtain the MapR packages for your operating
   system at [2]http://package.mapr.com/releases/ and complete the
   installation steps:

   For the Windows MapR client, see: [3]Installing the MapR Client on
   Windows.
   Warning: The client nodes also need to have the MapR repositories
   configured in order to pull the client packages. See [4]MapR
   Repositories and Packages.
