Install Drill to Run Under Warden

   Verify that your system meets the prerequisites listed below and then
   follow the instructions listed in [1]Installing Drill to Run Under
   Warden to install the mapr-drill package on all nodes designated to run
   Drill under the MapR Warden service.
   Note: Drill 1.11 is only supported on a cluster running MapR 6.0.

Prerequisites

   Before you install Drill, read [2]Installing Drill, and verify that the
   system meets the following prerequisites:
     * The MapR cluster is installed and running. Installing Drill first
       can result in configuration issues
     * The MEP repository is configured. For instructions, see [3]Step 9:
       Install Ecosystem Components Manually.

   Refer to the [4]Apache Drill Release Notes and [5]Drill Release Notes
   for a list of known issues.

Hive and HBase Support

   Installation of a supported version of Hive is optional. Support
   differs, depending on the MapR Expansion Pack version that you install.
   See [6]MEP Components and OS Support.

   As of MapR 6.0, HBase is not supported.
