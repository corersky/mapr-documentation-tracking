User Accounts

   This section identifies how to organize authorized users of the
   cluster.

   Part of the cluster plan is a list of authorized users of the cluster.
   It is preferable to give each user an account, because account-sharing
   makes administration less secure. Any user of the cluster must be
   established with the same Linux UID and GID on every node in the
   cluster. Central directory services, such as LDAP, AD, and IPA are
   often used to simplify user maintenance.
