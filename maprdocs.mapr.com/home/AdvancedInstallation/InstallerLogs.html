Logs for the MapR Installer

   This topic describes the logs generated by the MapR installer and MapR
   Installer Stanzas.

   MapR installer logs are written to the following folder:
   /opt/mapr/installer/logs.
   The following list describes each log:

   <nodename>.log[.x]
          Shows installation activities associated with a particular node.
          Every time you run the MapR installer or a MapR Installer
          Stanza, a new copy of this log is created for each node in the
          cluster. When you encounter errors, you should check this log
          first, and then check the mapr-installer.log.
          The node log is created only if the software was able to run
          Ansible successfully on the node. If incorrect credentials were
          provided for the root user, or if there was an issue and Ansible
          quit before issuing the first logging callback, no log file is
          created for the node. If this happens, you must consult
          mapr-installer.log.

   installer.log[.x]
          Logs the REST calls sent to the installer and the database
          events that the installer runs. Every time you run the MapR
          installer or a MapR Installer Stanza, a new copy of this log is
          created. If the log is not present, you might need to restart
          the installer (service mapr-installer restart).

   installer-cli.log[.x]
          Shows the progress of installation for a MapR Installer Stanza.
          Every time you run a MapR Installer Stanza, a new copy of this
          log is created.

   installer-process.log
          Serves as the top-level log file for the Ansible part of the
          installer. This log is created by the main Python script that
          runs the installer backend. This log typically shows the same
          information as mapr-installer.log.

   mapr-installer.log[.x]
          Shows the progress of Ansible scripts performed by the installer
          server. This log is useful if back-end issues prevent the
          creation of <nodename>.log. Every time you run the MapR
          installer or a MapR Installer Stanza, a new copy of this log is
          created.
