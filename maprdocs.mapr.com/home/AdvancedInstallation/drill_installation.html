Installing Drill

   This topic provides instructions for using package managers to download
   and install Drill.

   You can install and run Drill on any number of nodes in your MapR
   cluster. You can install Drill to run under the Warden service or under
   YARN. Starting in MapR 6.0 and Drill 1.11, Drill is secured by default
   when you install Drill on a secure MapR 6.x cluster.

   MapR Default Security Configuration
   As of Drill 1.11, Drill is automatically secured when you install Drill
   in a 6.x MapR cluster that was installed with the default MapR security
   configuration. The default security configuration uses MapR-SASL (mapr
   tickets) to provide authentication, authorization, and encryption for
   cluster security.
   Note: You can install Drill 1.11 and later on clusters running MapR
   6.x.
   Note: The default security configuration does not support
   Drill-on-YARN.
   The default MapR security configuration is not required. You can
   install Drill and configure custom security, or turn security off after
   installing with the default security configuration. See the Drill
   Installation Security Scenarios section below for more information. See
   [1]Securing Drill.

   Installing Drill Under Warden or YARN

   You can install and run Drill under Warden or you can install and run
   Drill under YARN. If you are currently running Drill under Warden, you
   can upgrade Drill and continue to run Drill under Warden, or you can
   migrate Drill to run under YARN. See [2]Migrate Drill to Run Under YARN
   for instructions.

   When Warden manages the Drill cluster, you can use the MapR Control
   System for monitoring. [3]YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a
   cluster management tool that automates the resource sharing process in
   a cluster. When you launch Drill under YARN, YARN deploys (localizes)
   Drill onto each node. You can monitor the Drill cluster using the
   Drill-on-YARN Application Master web UI.

Drill Packages

   You can use package managers to manually install the appropriate Drill
   package. The Drill packages provide the software needed to run Drill.
   In previous versions of Drill, MapR provided only the mapr-drill
   package. As of Drill 1.8, with the introduction of Drill-on-YARN, MapR
   also provides the mapr-drill-yarn package.

   Drill includes the Drill daemon, the core Drillbit service that runs on
   a node. Each node running the Drillbit service can receive, plan, and
   execute queries sent from a client. The software also includes the
   drill-shell command line interface, a pure-Java console-based utility,
   for connecting to a Drill cluster and executing SQL commands.

   The following sections list the Drill packages and their descriptions:

   mapr-drill
          The mapr-drill package is required to run Drill under the MapR
          Warden service. This package installs or upgrades the Drill
          software in /opt/mapr/drill and integrates Drill with the MapR
          Warden service. You install this package on all nodes designated
          to run Drill.

          Note: Verify that you get both the mapr-drill and
          mapr-drill-internal packages, especially if you install or
          upgrade through the URL or download through the MapR
          repositories. Also, verify that the packages have the same
          version. For example, if you install Drill 1.13, both packages
          should be version 1.13.

   mapr-drill-yarn
          The mapr-drill-yarn package is required to run Drill under YARN.
          This package installs the Drill software in /opt/mapr/drill. You
          install this package on the node that you designate as the
          Drill-on-YARN client. See [4]Install Drill to Run Under YARN for
          details. YARN deploys Drill to every node included in the Drill
          cluster. Installing this package on every node is not required.
          Note: If any users need to access SQLLine, you must install the
          mapr-drill-yarn package on every node where users expect access
          to SQLLine.

Drill and Query Services

   To use the optional [5]OJAI Distributed Query Service, you must install
   Drill and configure and register the service. See [6]Configure the OJAI
   Distributed Query Service.

Drill Installation Security Scenarios

   The following sections describe some manual installation scenarios for
   Drill with information about security configuration:

   Installing or Upgrading Drill

   You can install Drill on a MapR cluster with or without default
   security. After you install the Drill package, you must run the
   configuration script, [7]configure.sh -R, to configure the Drill
   service on the nodes. When you run the configuration script, the script
   recognizes whether your MapR cluster is using the default security or
   not, and configures Drill accordingly.
   In a secure cluster, an internal Drill configuration script
   automatically adds the security configuration to the drill-distrib.conf
   and distrib-env.sh files. See [8]Securing Drill.
   Note: You can override these default security settings in the
   drill-override.conf file, but doing so is not recommended or supported.

   If your cluster is not using the default security, the internal Drill
   configuration script does not configure any security for Drill.
   Instead, it copies [9]warden.drill-bits.conf to the conf.d directory.

   Installing Drill with MapR and Configuring Custom Security
   If you install MapR and Drill, and you want to manually secure the
   cluster and Drill instead of using the default security option, you
   must add a [10].customSecure file to the /usr/bin/touch /opt/mapr/conf/
   directory before you run configure.sh, as shown:
    1. Run /usr/bin/touch /opt/mapr/conf/.customSecure to add the
       .customSecure file.
    2. Run configure.sh -R.

   The configuration script recognizes the .customSecure file which
   indicates not to configure the default security settings. At this
   point, you can manually configure security in drill-override.conf.

   Turning Default Security On|Off After You Install Drill

   If you installed Drill on a MapR cluster with the default security
   option enabled, you can disable it. Likewise, if you did not enable the
   default security option, you can enable it. When you enable or disable
   the default security option, security is applied or removed across the
   cluster.

   For example, if your cluster is not secure and you enable the default
   security option, the entire MapR cluster is secured, as well as all
   supported ecosystem components, including Drill.
   In such a scenario, you must run the [11]configure.sh script with the
   -secure or -unsecure and -forceSecurityDefaults flags to update the
   configuration of the nodes and apply or remove security across the
   cluster, as shown:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -forceSecurityDefaults [ -unsecure | -secure ]
 -C <CLDB_node> -Z <ZK_node>

   The configuration script communicates with internal ecosystem scripts
   to automatically configure or remove security across the cluster.

Component and System Compatibility Matrix

   See the [12]Interoperability Matrix pages for information about the
   compatibility of Drill with operating systems and ecosystem projects.
