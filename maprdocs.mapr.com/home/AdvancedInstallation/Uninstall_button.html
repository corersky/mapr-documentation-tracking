Uninstalling Software Using the MapR Installer Uninstall Button

   You can use a single button to uninstall the MapR software on all nodes
   in the cluster.
   The Uninstall button appears on the status page of the MapR Installer
   web interface when you connect to an installed cluster. The Uninstall
   button removes MapR software (but does not remove the MapR Installer)
   from all nodes in the cluster.
   Note: You can also use MapR Installer Stanzas to uninstall software.
   See [1]Uninstalling MapR Core Using a MapR Installer Stanza.

   To use the Uninstall button:
    1. Use a browser to connect to the cluster using the MapR Installer
       URL:
https://<Installer Node hostname/IPaddress>:9443
    2. On the status screen, click the Uninstall button. The MapR
       Installer displays the Uninstall screen.
    3. Enter your SSH password and other authentication information as
       needed, and click Next. The installer begins the uninstall process.
