MapR Monitoring Storage Options

   This section describes different storage options for MapR Monitoring.
   The MapR Control System (MCS) relies on MapR Monitoring components to
   display MCS metrics, but it can function without the monitoring
   components. Using MapR Monitoring to store logs is optional.

   The following installation options are available for metric storage
   with OpenTSDB and log storage with Elasticsearch. You can store logs
   and metrics on a non-MapR cluster but this scenario is not supported by
   MapR.

Store Metrics and Logs on the Monitored Cluster

   You can store metrics and logs on the nodes in the same MapR cluster
   that you want to monitor. Note that installing Grafana is optional.

Store Metrics and Logs on a Storage Cluster

   You can store metrics and logs for the MapR cluster that you want to
   monitor on nodes in a different MapR cluster.

   In this case, Kibana and Grafana can be installed on either cluster.

Use a Single Cluster to Store Monitoring Data for Multiple Clusters

   You can store metrics and logs for more than one MapR cluster on a
   shared set of nodes. With this option, a single dashboard can monitor
   multiple clusters.

   In this case, Kibana and Grafana can be installed on any of these
   clusters.
