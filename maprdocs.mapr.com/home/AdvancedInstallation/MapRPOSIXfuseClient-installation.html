Installing FUSE-based POSIX Client Packages

   Describes how to install a FUSE-based Basic or Platinum POSIX client

   FUSE-based POSIX clients allow app servers, web servers, and other
   client nodes and apps to read and write data directly and securely to a
   MapR cluster like a Linux filesystem.
