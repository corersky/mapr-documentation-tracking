Example Cluster Designs

   This section describes considerations for designing a MapR cluster for
   maximum availability, fault-tolerance, and performance. The topic
   includes example cluster designs for 6-node, 12-node, and 50-node
   clusters.

Design Priorities

   Building a cluster requires you to make decisions – and sometimes
   tradeoffs – that take into account cluster attributes such as:
     * Performance
     * Fault-tolerance
     * Cost
     * Ease of use
     * Supportability
     * Reliability

   The following priorities and their related best practices can help you
   plan a durable cluster that includes all or most of these cluster
   attributes. The priorities are listed in order of importance:
     * [1]Priority 1 - Maximize Fault Tolerance
     * [2]Priority 2 - Minimize Resource Contention
     * [3]Priority 3 - Promote High Availability
     * [4]Priority 4 - Use Dedicated Nodes for Key Services for Large
       Clusters (50-100 Nodes)

Priority 1 - Maximize Fault Tolerance

   Follow these best practices to ensure that your MapR cluster can
   tolerate failures:
     * Ensure an odd number of Zookeeper services. Zookeeper fault
       tolerance depends on a [5]quorum of Zookeeper services being
       available. At least three Zookeeper services are recommended. For a
       higher level of fault tolerance, use five Zookeeper services. With
       five zookeepers, two can be lost and quorum maintained.
     * For other services, it makes sense for them to be at least as
       reliable as Zookeeper. Generally, this means at least two instances
       of the service for three Zookeepers and three instances for five
       Zookeepers.
     * Include enough CLDBs to be as reliable as Zookeeper. Because CLDBs
       use a [6]master-slave configuration, a MapR cluster can function
       with an odd or even number of CLDBs. The recommended minimum number
       of active CLDBs is two. To tolerate failures, more CLDBs are
       needed:
          + If you have three Zookeepers, configure at least three CLDBs.
          + If you have five Zookeepers, configure at least four CLDBs.
            With four CLDBs, the cluster can tolerate two CLDB failures
            and still provide optimal performance. Adding a fifth CLDB
            does not increase failure tolerance in this configuration.
     * Include enough Resource Manager processes to be as reliable as
       Zookeeper. Only one Resource Manager is active at a time. For
       example:
          + If you have three Zookeepers, you need at least two Resource
            Managers.
          + If you have five Zookeepers, you need at least three Resource
            Managers. Three Resource Managers can survive the loss of two
            Zookeepers.
     * For most MapR clusters, the recommended configuration is:
          + 3 Zookeepers
          + 3 CLDBs
          + 2-3 Resource Managers
          + For larger clusters, increase the number of CLDBs or
            Zookeepers if better performance or higher reliability is
            needed. Table 1 shows the number of failures tolerated by
            various combinations of Zookeeper, CLDB, and Resource Manager
            services.

   CAPTION: Table 1. Table 1: Fault Tolerance of Different
   Zookeeper-CLDB-RM Combinations

   Zookeepers CLDBs Resource Managers ZK/CLDB/RM Failures Tolerated
   3          2^1   2                 1
   3          3     2                 1
   5          4     3                 2
   5          5^2   3                 2

   ^1For optimal failure handling, the minimum number of CLDBs is three;
   hence, three or more CLDBs are recommended. With two CLDBs, the failure
   of one will not result in an outage, but recovery can take longer than
   with three.

   ^2Using five CLDBs does not improve fault-tolerance significantly when
   compared with four CLDBs. But it can be convenient to have the same
   number of CLDBs as Zookeepers.

Priority 2 - Minimize Resource Contention

   Every service on a node represents a tax on the resources provided by
   that node. Spreading services evenly across nodes maximizes performance
   and helps to keep failures isolated to failure domains. Because of
   power and networking considerations, a rack is usually the most common
   failure domain.
   Follow these best practices to avoid performance bottlenecks:
     * Spread like services across racks as much as possible. While not
       necessary, it is also convenient to put them in the same position,
       if possible.
     * To maximize availability, use three or more racks even for small
       clusters. Using two racks is not recommended. If a cluster has
       three Zookeepers, using two racks means one of the racks will host
       two Zookeepers. In this scenario, a loss of a rack having two
       Zookeepers can jeopardize the cluster.
          + For services that are replicated, make sure the replicas are
            in different racks.
          + Put the Resource Manager and CLDB services on separate nodes,
            if possible.
          + Put the Zookeeper and CLDB services on separate nodes, if
            possible.
     * Some administrators find it convenient to put web-oriented services
       together on nodes with lower IP addresses in a rack. This is not
       required.
     * Avoid putting multiple resource-heavy services on the same node.
     * Spread the following resources across all data nodes:
          + Clients
          + Drill
          + NFS

Priority 3 - Promote High Availability

   Whenever possible, configure high availability (HA) for all services,
   not just for services that provide HA by default. The CLDB, Zookeeper,
   Resource Manager, and Drill provide HA by default. Some services are
   inherently stateless. If possible, configure multiple instances of
   these services:
     * Kafka REST
     * HBase Thrift
     * HBase REST
     * HTTPFS
     * HiveServer 2 (HS2)
     * Hue
     * Kafka Connect
     * MapR Data Access Gateway
     * MapR Gateway
     * Oozie
     * OpenTSDB
     * WebHCat
     * WebServer

Priority 4 - Use Dedicated Nodes for Key Services for Large Clusters (50-100
Nodes)

   Large clusters increase CLDB and Resource Manager workloads
   significantly. In clusters of 50 or more nodes:
     * Use dedicated nodes for CLDB, Zookeeper, and Resource Manager.
       Note: Dedicated nodes have the benefit of supporting fast fail-over
       for file-server operations.
     * If fast fail-over is not critical and you need to minimize hardware
       costs, you may combine the CLDB and Zookeeper nodes. For example, a
       large cluster might include 3 to 9 such combined nodes.
     * If necessary, review and adjust the hardware composition of CLDB,
       Zookeeper, and Resource Manager nodes. Once you have chosen to use
       dedicated nodes for these services, you might determine that they
       do not need to be identical to other cluster nodes. For example,
       dedicated CLDB and Zookeeper nodes probably do not need as much
       storage as other cluster nodes.
     * Avoid configuring Drill on CLDB or Zookeeper nodes.

Example Clusters

   The following examples are reasonable implementations of the design
   priorities introduced earlier in this section. Other designs are
   possible and may satisfy your unique environment and workloads.
     * [7]Example 1: 6-Node Cluster
     * [8]Example 2: 12-Node Cluster
     * [9]Example 3: 50-Node Cluster

Example 1: 6-Node Cluster

   Example 1 shows a 6-node cluster contained in a single rack. When only
   a single rack is available, this example can work for small clusters.
   However, the recommended best practice for all clusters, regardless of
   size, is to use three or more racks, if possible.

   performance, consider running these services on all nodes and adding a
   load balancer to distribute network traffic.
