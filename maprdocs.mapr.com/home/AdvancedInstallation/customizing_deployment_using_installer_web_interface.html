Customizing Your Deployment by Using the MapR Installer Web Interface

   If you use a MapR offering or reference template, the cluster is
   installed for you according to the parameters you specified. Another
   way to customize the resources and services provisioned to a MapR
   cluster on AWS or Azure is to create a stack or resource group with
   only the MapR Installer. Once the stack or resource group is created,
   you can use the MapR Installer web interface to finish configuring the
   cluster.

   This procedure is the same for AWS and Azure:
    1. Choose one of these procedures to create an AWS stack or an Azure
       resource group:
          + [1]Running the MapR AWS Templates
          + [2]Running the MapR Azure Templates
    2. When you run the template, fill in the MapR template values as
       described in one of previous topics:
       Important: In the provisioningTemplate field (AWS) or Service
       Template field (Azure), select Custom-Configuration for the
       [3]auto-provisioning template. Selecting Custom-Configuration
       instructs the template to install only the MapR Installer and
       related software so that you can finish the cluster installation on
       your own.
    3. After stack creation (AWS) or resource group creation (Azure), log
       on to the MapR Installer, and use the web interface and on-screen
       user assistance to configure the resources and services you need in
       the cluster.
       Note: For cloud-based installations, the MapR Installer displays
       Authentication screens with cloud-specific parameters that are
       different from the Authentication screens for on-premise clusters.
       Use the tooltips on these screens to understand the authentication
       information that you need to provide for your cluster.
