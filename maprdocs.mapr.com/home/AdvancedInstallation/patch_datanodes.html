Step 2: Apply the Patch to Data Nodes

   When applying a patch manually, apply the patch to nodes dedicated to
   storing and processing data prior to applying the patch on nodes that
   run the CLDB. This includes nodes that run the Fileserver for storage
   and processing components such as the Node Manager and the HBase
   client.
   Note: For clusters with more than 100 data nodes, it is a best practice
   to apply the patch in batches. Also, wait a few minutes before
   proceeding to the next batch of nodes.

   Complete the following steps on each data node:
    1. Stop the MapR Warden and ZooKeeper (if installed) services:
         a. To stop MapR Warden , run the following command:
sudo service mapr-warden stop
         b. If Zookeeper is installed on the node, run this command:
sudo service mapr-zookeeper stop
    2. If there is already a patch installed on the cluster, run one of
       the following commands to uninstall it:
          + On CentOS/Redhat: sudo rpm -e mapr-patch
          + On SUSE: sudo zypper remove mapr-patch
          + On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get -y remove mapr-patch
    3. Install the patch using one of the following commands:
          + On CentOS/RedHat: sudo rpm -ivh
            mapr-patch-<new_patch_number>.rpm
          + On SUSE: sudo zypper install mapr-patch-<new_patch_number>.rpm
          + On Ubuntu: sudo dpkg -i mapr-patch<new_patch_number>.deb
    4. Start the MapR Warden and ZooKeeper (if installed) services:
         a. If ZooKeeper is installed on the node, run this command to
            start ZooKeeper:
sudo service mapr-zookeeper start
         b. To start Warden, run this command:
sudo service mapr-warden start
    5. To verify that the patch was installed successfully, run one of the
       following commands:
          + On CentOS/Redhat or SUSE: sudo rpm -ql
            mapr-patch-<new_patch_number>
          + On Ubuntu: sudo dpkg -l | grep mapr-patch-<new_patch_number>
