Installing the File Migration Service on the Edge Cluster

   To install the package on CentOS, run the following command:
yum install mapr-filemigrate

   Note: The File Migration service is only supported on CentOS. There are
   no packages for debian based OS.

   Since the File Migration service provides for high availability, you
   can install it on as many nodes as you wish. Warden will ensure that it
   is always active on exactly one node.

   After installation, a sample properties file,
   FileMigrate.properties.default, with default values can be found in
   /opt/mapr/filemigrate/filemigrate-1.0.0/conf directory. If you choose
   to edit the properties file manually to configure the service, follow
   the steps for [1]Configuring the File Migration Service Using the
   Properties File. If you use the UI to configure the service, it will
   automatically create the necessary file in
   maprfs:///var/mapr/filemigrate directory. For more information, see
   [2]Configuring File Migration Service Using the UI.
