CloudFormation Troubleshooting

   If there are errors during CloudFormation:
     * Check the stack creation events for more information. Click the
       Events tab to get more information. You can expand the event
       message to see more information about the event.
     * Check the status of the auto scaling group. In EC2, click Auto
       Scaling Groups. Select a group. Then select the Activity History
       tab.
     * Consult the [1]AWS troubleshooting information.
