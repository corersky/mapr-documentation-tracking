Add the repository on each node

   Each node must contain your local repository.
    1. Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list on each node,
       replacing <host> with the IP address or hostname of the node where
       you created the repository:
deb http://<host>/mapr binary optional
    2. On each node update the package indexes (as root or with sudo).
       After performing these steps, you can use apt-get to install MapR
       software and Hadoop ecosystem components on each node from the
       local repository.
apt-get update
