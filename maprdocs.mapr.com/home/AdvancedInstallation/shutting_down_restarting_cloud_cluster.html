Shutting Down and Restarting a Cloud-Based MapR Cluster

   Shutting down and restarting a cloud-based MapR cluster is different
   from shutting down and restarting an on-premise cluster. For on-premise
   clusters, using the MapR Installer Shutdown button stops MapR services
   but leaves the nodes running. For cloud-based clusters, the shutdown
   operation halts all nodes in the cluster. Shutdown and restart are the
   same for AWS and Azure clusters.
   For shutdown instructions, see one of these topics:
