Planning for Access to the Cluster

   Before installing a MapR cluster in the cloud, be sure to review this
   information so that you can plan for access to the cluster.

Public and Private IP Addresses

   Cloud-based MapR clusters are installed by default in a virtual private
   cloud (AWS) or virtual network (Azure) using private IP addresses. You
   must make sure you have a way to connect to the private IP addresses of
   each node in the cluster. For the Azure marketplace offering and the
   reference templates (AWS and Azure), OpenVPN can be configured to
   facilitate secure access.

   For the AWS marketplace offering, if you don't use a public IP address,
   you need to ensure that you have a way to connect to the VPC and the
   private IP of the nodes.

Security Groups

   The MapR reference templates for AWS and Azure support the use of
   security groups. Security groups allow you to control precisely the
   traffic that can access your instance. For AWS, you can use existing
   security groups or create new ones. For more information, see:
     * [1]AWS Security Group Information
     * [2]Azure Network Security Group Information

OpenVPN

   Some MapR reference templates for AWS and Azure provide an option to
   install [3]OpenVPN. OpenVPN is an open-source software application that
   creates a virtual private network (VPN) between your workstation and
   the cloud-based MapR cluster. If you do not want to use your network
   infrastructure or public IP addresses to connect to the cloud, OpenVPN
   can provide a secure connection. For more information, see [4]Using
   OpenVPN.
