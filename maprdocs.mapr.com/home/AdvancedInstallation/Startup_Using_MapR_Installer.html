Starting Up a Cluster Using the MapR Installer Startup Button

   You can use a single button to start MapR software on a cluster.

   The Startup button is a feature of MapR Installer 1.8 or later. The
   Startup button appears on the status page of the MapR Installer web
   interface when the cluster is in the shutdown state. The Startup button
   starts Warden and Zookeeper, which in turn start other running services
   that are part of a MapR cluster.
   Note: If the Startup button is not visible and the Shutdown button is
   present, the cluster is still running and is not in the shutdown state
   The Startup button works differently depending on your cluster
   deployment:
   Deployment Startup Button Behavior
   On premise Starts the Zookeeper and Warden services on all nodes.
   In the cloud Starts the virtual machine nodes and then starts Zookeeper
   and Warden services on all nodes.

   To use the Startup button:
    1. For a cluster deployed in the cloud, use the AWS console or the
       Azure portal to ensure that the nodes are shut down before you try
       to start them.
    2. Use a browser to connect to the cluster using the MapR Installer
       URL:
https://<Installer Node hostname/IPaddress>:9443
    3. On the status screen, click the Startup button. The MapR Installer
       displays the Authentication screen.
    4. Enter your authentication information if requested, and click
       Startup. The installer begins the startup process.
    5. To shut down MapR software on the cluster, see [1]Shutting Down a
       Cluster Using the MapR Installer Shutdown Button
