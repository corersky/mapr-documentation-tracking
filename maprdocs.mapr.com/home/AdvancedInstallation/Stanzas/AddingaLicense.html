Adding a License

   In addition to using maprcli, REST commands, or the MapR Control System
   (MCS) to add a license, you can add a license using MapR Installer
   Stanzas. After obtaining a valid license file from your MapR sales
   representative, copy the license file to a cluster node (for example,
   to /tmp/license.txt). You can then use the license command to apply the
   license to the cluster. For example:
mapr-installer-cli license -n -l <path-to-license-file>
