Uninstalling MapR Core Using a MapR Installer Stanza

   You can use the uninstall command to uninstall the current MapR
   version. The uninstall command requires that you specify two overrides:
     * config.ssh_id
     * config.ssh_password or config.ssh_key_file

   Note: Using the the uninstall command requires root privileges. You can
   provide the root ID and password or the root ID and ssh_key_file.
   This example uninstalls the currently installed MapR software. The
   command uses an override to provide the ssh_id and ssh_password and
   includes -nv so that certificates will not be checked, and the output
   mode is verbose.
./bin/mapr-installer-cli uninstall -nv -o config.ssh-id=root -o config.ssh_passw
ord=mapr

   This example uninstalls the currently installed MapR software. The
   command uses an override to provide the ssh_id and ssh_key_file and
   includes -nv so that certificates will not be checked, and the output
   mode is verbose. The ssh_key_file for root normally resides in
   /root/.ssh. In this example, the file has been copied to
   /home/mapr/root so that the mapr user can access the key file.
./bin/mapr-installer-cli uninstall -nv -o config.ssh_id=root -o config.ssh_key_f
ile=/home/mapr/root_user_id_rsa
