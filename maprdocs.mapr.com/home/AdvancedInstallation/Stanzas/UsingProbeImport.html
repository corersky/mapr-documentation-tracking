Using probe and import to Generate the Installer Database

   If a cluster has MapR software installed but has no installer database,
   you cannot install or upgrade the cluster using MapR Installer Stanza
   commands. And you cannot use the web-based MapR Installer on the
   cluster. However, you can generate an installer database on a cluster
   by using the probe and import commands. Once the installer database is
   generated, you can use the web-based installer and all MapR Installer
   Stanza commands on the cluster.
   Note: Using probe and import to generate the installer database is
   supported only on MapR 5.2 and later. If you need to use this feature
   on an earlier MapR version, please contact your MapR representative.
   Note: If you are not sure if your cluster has an installer database,
   you can use the export command to generate a YAML file that describes
   the cluster configuration. See [1]Exporting a Cluster Configuration.

Using probe

   Before using the probe command, you must know the host names or IP
   addresses of the cluster nodes and the root user, which must be the
   same on all nodes. The probe command generates a template that will be
   used by the import command.
   Note: Do not make changes to the probe-generated template file. After
   the installer database is created, you can use the export command to
   export a YAML for making changes.

   In this example, the probing user, mapr1, probes an array of hosts
   (config.hosts) and generates a template file /tmp/location.yaml. Note
   that the probing user must be able to do rpm and pkg queries and have
   permission to read certain files and directories within /opt/mapr.
mapr-installer-cli probe -n -o config.ssh_id=mapr1 config.ssh_password=xyz confi
g.hosts='["hostname[1-3]","hostname7"]' > /tmp/location.yaml

   Note: The probe command can use various methods to determine the MEP
   version of a node. One method checks the MEP repo URL defined on the
   node. If multiple MEP repos are defined on the same node, the probe
   command ignores all of them and tries to determine the MEP version
   based on the MapR packages that are present.

Using import

   The import command prepares the installer database based on the probed
   template file. This example imports the probed YAML template file from
   the previous example. -t specifies the location of the template file:
mapr-installer-cli import -n -t /tmp/location.yaml

   After you use the import command, the installer database should be
   operational. You can then use the web-based MapR Installer or Stanzas
   to perform additional operations on the cluster. See [2]MapR Installer.
