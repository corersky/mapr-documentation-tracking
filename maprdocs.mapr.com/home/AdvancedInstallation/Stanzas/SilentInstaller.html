MapR Installer Stanzas

   This section describes how to prepare for and use MapR Installer
   Stanzas to install, upgrade, or uninstall MapR software.

   MapR Installer Stanzas enable API-driven installation of MapR clusters.
   An extension of the [1]Spyglass Initiative, MapR Installer Stanzas
   enable the creation of a YAML configuration file (a "Stanza") that
   describes a cluster. A command-line addition to the web-based MapR
   Installer allows you to execute the configuration file programmatically
   to automate new deployments.

   You can use MapR Installer Stanzas when you need a script-based tool to
   install MapR software and you do not want to click through the menus
   and options provided by the MapR Installer. MapR Installer Stanzas
   provide less visual feedback than the MapR Installer, but they can be
   faster and more efficient at installing software on clusters with many
   nodes.

   To use MapR Installer Stanzas:
    1. Review the [2]MapR Installer Stanza Prerequisites.
    2. Use the steps in [3]Using the MapR Installer to download and run
       the mapr-setup.sh script. Performing these steps installs both the
       web-based MapR installer and the MapR Installer Stanzas feature.
    3. Review or edit the Stanza file. The Stanza file specifies the
       installation parameters for your cluster. See [4]Working with MapR
       Installer Stanza Files.
    4. Run the MapR Installer Stanza file. See [5]Running MapR Installer
       Stanza Files.
