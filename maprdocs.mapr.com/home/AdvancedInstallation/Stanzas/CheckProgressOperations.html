Checking the Progress of Operations

   This topic describes how to use the MapR Installer web interface and
   installer logs to check the status of MapR Installer Stanza operations.

Using the MapR Installer to Check Status

   The installer provides messages and progress bars to indicate the
   status of MapR Installer Stanza operations. However, you can also use
   the [1]MapR Installer interface to check the current status of your
   cluster. The MapR Installer provides a quick visual summary of the
   currently installed software versions and services.
   To view the MapR Installer web interface:

Viewing the Installer Logs

   To view or understand the logs generated by the MapR Installer or MapR
   Installer Stanza operations, see [2]MapR Installer Log Descriptions.
