Resetting the Installer Database

   The reset command uninstalls the metadata from the installer database.
   reset is for advanced users.

   The reset command can be useful for testing purposes, but use reset
   with caution. If you reset the installer database while packages are
   installed on the nodes, you will need to remove the packages manually.
   Note: If you experience a failure while installing or uninstalling, the
   installer prompts you to retry the operation or uninstall and then
   reinstall from scratch. You should always retry or uninstall before
   considering using reset.

   This example resets the installer database. The -nv option specifies
   that certfificates will not be checked and the output mode is verbose:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli reset -nv
