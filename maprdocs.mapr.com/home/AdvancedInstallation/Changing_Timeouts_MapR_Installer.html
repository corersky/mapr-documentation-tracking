Changing Timeout Values to Resolve MapR Installer Errors

   Change timeout values to reduce errors when using the MapR Installer.

   Sometimes the MapR Installer can return errors because the maprcli or
   filesystem commands that it uses time out because of network latency.
   For example, if logs indicate that the installer could not obtain the
   nodelist, or a filesystem operation timed out, changing a timeout value
   can enable the same MapR Installer operation to succeed.
   You can change the following timeout parameters to improve the success
   of MapR Installer operations:
   Timeout Description Default Value (minutes)
   standard The timeout used for maprcli commands and Hadoop filesystem
   operations. 2
   configure The timeout used for configure.sh operations. 10

   You must specify timeout values as an integer greater than or equal to
   0.

   To change the standard or configure timeout values:
    1. On the MapR Installer node, navigate to the following directory:
/opt/mapr/installer/ansible/playbooks/group_vars/
    2. Edit the all file to change one or both timeout values to a number
       greater than or equal to 0. In this example, the timeouts are set
       to 7 minutes and 15 minutes respectively:
timeout:
  standard: 7
  configure: 15
    3. If a MapR Installer error prompted you to change the timeout, retry
       the operation that failed.
