Deleting an AWS Stack

   MapR resources in AWS are grouped together, making it easy for you to
   remove them. You can use the MapR Installer Destroy button to delete an
   AWS stack in one operation. The Destroy button is present when the MapR
   Installer detects cloud installations that were created using MapR
   scripts.

   You can also use manual steps to delete an AWS stack. Because the MapR
   stack is an Auto Scaling Group, deleting it manually requires extra
   steps. First, you must disable certain AWS processes that protect
   against shutting down the stack. Then you must remove the stack.

Delete an AWS Stack Using the Destroy Button

   To remove an AWS stack in one operation, use the Destroy button:
    1. Log in to the MapR Installer.
    2. On the status page, click the Destroy button. The MapR Installer
       prompts you for your user name and password.
    3. Enter your user name and password, and click OK.

Delete Suspended Processes

   You do not need to use these steps if you use the Destroy button. To
   remove an AWS stack manually, you must delete suspended processes and
   then delete the stack.
    1. Click Services > EC2.
    2. In the left navigation pane, under Auto Scaling, click the link to
       Auto Scaling Groups.
    3. In the list of Auto Scaling Groups, find and select the name of
       your stack.
       Note: Type the first few letters of the stack name in the Filter
       field to find the stack.
    4. Click the Details tab to select it.
    5. Click Edit.
    6. Scroll down to the Suspended Processes section:

    7. Click the "x" in each of the suspended processes to delete it.
    8. Click Save.

Delete the Stack

   You do not need to use these steps if you use the Destroy button. To
   remove an AWS stack manually, you must delete suspended processes and
   then delete the stack.
    1. Navigate to the CloudFormation section, and select your stack.
    2. From the Actions menu, select Delete Stack.
    3. To confirm the delete operation, click Yes, Delete.
