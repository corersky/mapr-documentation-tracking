Service Layout Guidelines for Large Clusters

   This section contains information about installing and segregating
   services on large clusters.

General Guidelines

   The following are guidelines for installing services on large clusters:
     * ResourceManager: Run the ResourceManager services on dedicated
       nodes for clusters with over 250 nodes.
     * Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch consumes significant CPU, disk, and
       memory resources. Review the following guidelines:
          + Whenever possible, Elasticsearch should have a dedicated disk
            for its index directory.
          + Depending on the number of indexed logs, you may want to run
            the Elasticsearch service on five or more dedicated nodes.
          + On production clusters, consider increasing Elasticsearch's
            memory allocation. After you install MapR Monitoring, see
            [1]Configure the Elasticsearch Service Heap Size.
          + On clusters with high-density racks, run one or more
            Elasticsearch services on each rack. Also, configure Fluentd
            to write logs to Elasticsearch services that reside on the
            same rack as the Fluentd services. After you install MapR
            Monitoring, see [2]Configure Fluentd Services to Write to
            Elasticsearch Nodes on the Same Rack.
     * OpenTSDB: Run the OpenTSDB service on five or more nodes for
       clusters over 100 nodes.

Services to Separate on Large Clusters

   The following are guidelines about which services to separate on large
   clusters:
     * ResourceManager on ZooKeeper nodes: Avoid running the
       ResourceManager service on nodes that are running the ZooKeeper
       service. On large clusters, the ResourceManager service can consume
       significant resources.
     * Monitoring Services on CLDB Nodes: Avoid running the OpenTSDB,
       Elasticsearch, Kibana, or Grafana services on nodes that are
       running the CLDB service.
