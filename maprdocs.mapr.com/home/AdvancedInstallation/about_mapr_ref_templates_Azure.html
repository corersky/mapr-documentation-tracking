About the MapR Reference Templates for Azure

   The MapR reference templates for Azure contain the scripts and JSON
   templates for deploying a MapR cluster. You can use the reference
   templates without modification, or you can customize them to suit your
   environment.

   The reference templates can be found on [1]GitHub in folders organized
   by the MapR Installer version. To determine your MapR Installer
   version, see [2]Checking the MapR Installer Version.
   This table describes the Azure reference templates:
   Note: For a given JSON file name, the deployment name in Azure is
   similar, but does not necessarily match the file names below.
   Template Type Template File Name Function
   Primary Template mainTemplate.json References the child templates that
   do segregated work to create Azure resources and deploy MapR software.
   This is where most of the defaults can be changed to customize
   deployments.
   Child Template createUiDefinition.json MapR marketplace GUI
   implementation. This is a standalone file and isn't used to deploy MapR
   software. This file generates JSON from user input and then sends the
   JSON to the mainTemplate.json.
   Child Template network.json Child template to mainTemplate.json.
   Creates a Virtual Network and Subnet when the option to create a new is
   supplied.
   Child Template openvpn.json Child template to mainTemplate.json.
   Creates all VM resources for the OpenVPN server then executes the
   mapr-vpn.sh script.
   Child Template vm.json Child template to mainTemplate.json. Creates all
   VM resources in the cluster, including the installer node. For
   password-enabled and public-key-enabled OS users only.
   Script install_openvpn_access_server.sh Installs OpenVPN core to an
   Ubuntu 17 image.
   Script mapr-cloud-configure.sh Installs MapR to the newly created VMs.
   The vm_xxx.json files will send parameters to this file to initiate a
   Stanza MapR installation. This file is run only on the installer node.
   Script mapr-init.sh Initialization script that is run on all nodes in
   the cluster (not just the install node). For example, this script sets
   passwords and sudo access.
   Script mapr-vpn-configure.sh Alters the configuration of the core
   OpenVPN to match inputs from the user.
   Script mapr-vpn.sh Decides if OpenVPN has been installed and configured
   already. Since the templates might be run several times by expanding
   the cluster, this file will not attempt to install or configure OpenVPN
   if it has been done already.
   Sample Stanza Input File mapr-core.yml Basic Stanza file. This file has
   several placeholders that mapr-cloud-configure.sh changes. For example,
   changes to services that are global across all types of deployments can
   be changed here.

   Provided as a convenience for users who need a script-based tool to
   install MapR software. See [3]Using MapR Installer Stanzas.
