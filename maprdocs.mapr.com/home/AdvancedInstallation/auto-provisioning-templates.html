Auto-Provisioning Templates

   Describes the MapR Installer auto-provisioning templates.

   Auto-provisioning templates let you select from different provisioning
   options to address a range of computing requirements. Each template
   provides a different mix of services and capabilities. You can select
   the template you need when installing using the MapR Installer
   web-based interface, MapR Installer Stanzas, or a cloud marketplace
   offering.

   MapR Installer 1.9 provides the following auto-provisioning templates:

MapR Installer 1.9 Updates to the Auto-Provisioning Templates

   For MapR Installer 1.9, the following changes to the auto-provisioning
   templates were implemented:
     * A new auto-provisioning template was added. The Operational
       Applications with MapR-DB and Distributed Query Service template
       includes the MapR DataBase and the OJAI Distributed Query services.
     * Other templates were changed to enable the use of Drill as an
       optional selection with the OJAI Distributed Query Service. The
       following table compares the contents of the various MapR-DB
       templates:

   Template MapR-DataBase OJAI Distributed Query Service* Drill
   MapR Converged Cluster: Batch, interactive and real-time analytics Y Y
   Y
   Analytics with MapR-DB Y Y Y
   Operational Applications with MapR-DB Y N N
   Operational Applications with MapR-DB and Distributed Query Service Y Y
   N
       *Prior to MapR Installer 1.9, this service was called the OJAI
       Query Service.
