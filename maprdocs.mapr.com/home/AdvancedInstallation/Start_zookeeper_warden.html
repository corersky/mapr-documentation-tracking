Starting Zookeeper and Warden

   Starting ZooKeeper and Warden brings up the cluster.

   Depending on the options that you specified when running
   [1]configure.sh, Zookeeper and Warden might already be started.
   To check that Zookeeper is started:
service mapr-zookeeper status

   To check that Warden is started:
service mapr-warden status

   To start the cluster if Zookeeper and Warden are not started:
    1. Start ZooKeeper on all nodes where it is installed, by issuing the
       following command:
service mapr-zookeeper start
    2. Start Warden on all nodes:
service mapr-warden start
