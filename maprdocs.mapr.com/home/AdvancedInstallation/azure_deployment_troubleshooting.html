Azure Deployment Troubleshooting

   If Azure reports a problem during deployment, follow these steps to
   determine where the problem occurred. Typically, the problem is either
   an Azure resource issue or a MapR installation issue.
    1. Use these steps to learn more about the issue that needs
       troubleshooting:
         a. Log in to the [1]Azure portal.
         b. In the left navigation pane, select Resource groups.
         c. Find the resource group to which the MapR installation was
            deployed.
         d. Click Deployments.
         e. Find the deployment that had a failure. Typically, an error on
            the Microsoft.Template will not be relevant, and there should
            be at least two deployments with a failure.
         f. If the error does not report an issue with mapr-installer, the
            issue is not MapR-related, and the error reported should
            indicate the Azure issue that caused the problem.
    2. If the issue appears to be MapR-related:
         a. Use ssh to connect to the MapR installer node.
            Note: The MapR Installer is always created on the virtual
            machine that ends in the number 0. For example,
            certtest1-cluster-com-mapr-vm0 would have the running
            installer, while certtest1-cluster-com-mapr-vm3 (or any other
            number) would not.
         b. As root, go to /var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/.
         c. Inspect the stdout and stderr files. These files contain the
            messages output from running the scripts that install the MapR
            software using Stanzas.
         d. If the problem cannot be identified, check the MapR Installer
            logs at /opt/mapr/installer/logs. For more information, see
            [2]Logs for the MapR Installer.
