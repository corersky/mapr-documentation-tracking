MapR Installer Prerequisites and Guidelines

   The node on which you run the MapR installer and the nodes you plan to
   include in your MapR cluster must meet the following requirements.

Installer Requirements

   The node that runs the MapR Installer must meet the following
   requirements:
   MapR Node

   Beginning with MapR Installer 1.6, the node that runs the MapR
   Installer does not need to be one of the nodes you plan to install the
   cluster on.

   Ensure that the default umask for the root user is set to 0022 on all
   MapR nodes in the cluster. The umask setting is changed in the
   /etc/profile file, or in the .cshrc or .login file. The root user must
   have a 0022 umask because the MapR admin user requires access to all
   files and directories under the /opt/mapr directory, even those
   initially created by root services.
   Package Dependencies
   Based on the operating system, it requires the following packages:
     On Ubuntu Nodes  On Red Hat / CentOS Nodes On SUSE Nodes
     * ca-certificates
     * curl
     * debianutils
     * dnsutils
     * iputils-arping
     * libnss3
     * libssl1.0.0
     * libsysfs2
     * netcat
     * nfs-common
     * ntp
     * ntpdate
     * openssl
     * python-dev
     * python-pycurl
     * sdparm
     * sudo
     * syslinux
     * sysstat
     * uuid-runtime
     * wget

     * curl
     * device-mapper
     * iputils
     * libsysfs
     * lvm2
     * nc
     * nfs-utils
     * ntp
     * nss
     * openssl
     * python-devel
     * sdparm

     * ca-certificates
     * curl
     * device-mapper
     * iputils
     * libopenssl1_0_0
     * sysfsutils
     * lvm2
     * mozilla-nss
     * nfs-client
     * ntp
     * sdparm
     * sudo
     * syslinux
     * sysstat
     * util-linux
     * wget
     * libfreebl3

   If these packages are not found, the MapR Installer will attempt to
   download them from Internet repositories.
   Java

   The MapR Installer must have JDK 1.7 or higher. Even though MapR 6.0
   requires JDK 1.8 or higher, the MapR Installer can function with JDK
   1.7 because the installer can run outside the MapR cluster.

   If JDK 1.7 or higher is unavailable, mapr-setup.sh will install
   OpenJDK.
     * On RedHat/CentOS, mapr-setup.sh installs Open JDK Java 1.8.
     * On Ubuntu, mapr-setup.sh installs Open JDK Java 1.7.

   SSH Access The MapR Installer must have SSH access to all nodes that
   you want to include in the cluster.
   Port Availability Port 9443 or the non-default port that you configure
   using mapr-setup.sh must be accessible on the MapR Installer node to
   all nodes that you want to include in the cluster.
   Once the MapR Installer is installed and configured, the following web
   browsers can be used to access the MapR Installer web interface:
     * Safari
     * Firefox
     * Google Chrome

   For more information, see the [1]MapR Installer Support Matrix.

User Requirements

   The installation process requires a valid MapR user to be present on
   all nodes in the cluster. The MapR Installer can create a user (the
   mapr user) for you or use a user that you have created. If you choose
   to create a user, make sure the following conditions are met:
     * The user must have a home directory and a password.
     * The user must be present on all nodes in the cluster.
     * The numeric user and group IDs (MAPR_UID and MAPR_GUID) must be
       configured for the user, and these values must match on all nodes.
     * The mapr user and root user must be configured to use bash. Other
       shells are not supported.

   If the user is not a valid user, installation errors can result. For
   information about creating the user, see [2]Managing Users and Groups.

   If you choose to have the installer create the user, the installer runs
   the following command to add a local user to serve as the cluster admin
   user:
useradd -m -u $MAPR_UID -g $MAPR_GID -G $(stat -c '%G' /etc/shadow) $MAPR_USER

   In this command:
     * MAPR_USER defaults to mapr.
     * MAPR_UID defaults to 5000.
     * MAPR_GID defaults to 5000.
     * The home directory is typically /home/mapr.

   The installer also adds the following to the MAPR_USER's .bashrc file:
[[ -f {{ mapr_home }}/conf/env.sh ]] && . {{ mapr_home }}/conf/env.sh

Node Requirements

   Nodes that you want to include in the cluster must meet the following
   criteria:
     * They are configured to accept operating system and security
       updates. They must also be patched with the latest security fixes.
       See your operating-system vendor documentation for details.
     * They meet the requirements listed in [3]Preparing Each Node. The
       MapR Installer will verify the requirements prior to installation.
     * They have HTTPS access to the MapR Installer node over port 9443.

   When you specify the nodes in the MapR Installer, the nodes must also
   be defined by resolvable hostnames or static IP addresses.

   If nodes in the cluster use an HTTP proxy server, the nodes must also
   meet the following requirements:
     * The no_proxy environment variable must be set.
       Nodes in the MapR cluster need to be able to communicate without
       the use of a proxy. If the https_proxy and http_proxy environment
       variable is set for nodes in the cluster, you must also set the
       no_proxy environment variable for the MapR admin user and the root
       user on each node. Configure the no_proxy environment variable to
       the IP range of the MapR nodes or to the sub-domain that contains
       the MapR nodes.
       In addition, you must follow this guideline from the [4]Python
       documentation: "The no_proxy environment variable can be used to
       specify hosts which shouldn't be reached via proxy; if set, it
       should be a comma-separated list of hostname suffixes, optionally
       with :port appended, for example
       cern.ch,ncsa.uiuc.edu,some.host:8080."
       For cloud-based clusters (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine (GCE),
       and Microsoft Azure), you must include this entry in the no-proxy
       configuration:
169.254.169.254
     * The global proxy for package repositories must be set.
       MapR Installer creates repository files. However, the proxy setting
       is not configured for each repository. Therefore, configure global
       proxy settings on each node in the cluster.
          + On CentOS/RedHat, set global proxy settings in /etc/yum.conf.
          + On Ubuntu, set global proxy settings in /etc/apt/apt.conf.

Using the MapR Installer on Nodes in the Cloud

   When you run the MapR Installer on nodes in the cloud, you must:
     * Verify that port 9443 is open.
       The MapR Installer requires that this port is available.
     * Ensure that the MapR Installer and service UI URLs should refer to
       an external URL and not an internal URL.
       For example, when you open the MapR installer URL, replace any
       internal hostname or IP address with its associated external
       address. For Amazon EC2 and Google Compute Engine (GCE) clusters,
       the MapR Installer automatically translates internal addresses to
       external addresses.
     * On the Configure Nodes page of the MapR Installer web interface,
       make sure that you do the following:
          + Define each node with internal static IP addresses or internal
            resolvable hostnames.
          + For the remote authentication, use the same user ID and
            private key that you use to ssh into your cloud instances.
            This user must be root or a user with sudo permissions.
