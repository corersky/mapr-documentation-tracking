Environmental Variables for the MapR Installer Container

   This section describes environmental variables that you can modify to
   customize the sample-run script for the MapR Installer container.

About mapr-docker-installer.sh

   mapr-docker-installer.sh is the sample-run script for the MapR
   Installer container. The script contains the docker run command that
   runs the container and environmental variables that can be passed into
   the container at run time. Modifying the variables is optional; the
   script can run without any changes to the environmental variables.

   The following environmental variables can be changed in
   mapr-docker-installer.sh:

Environmental Variables in mapr-docker-installer.sh

   Key Variable Description
   MAPR_CONTAINER_USER <user-name>

   The user that the user application inside the Docker container will run
   as. This configuration is functionally equivalent to the Docker native
   -u or --user. Do not use Docker -u or --user, as the container needs to
   start as the root user to bring up FUSE before switching to the
   MAPR_CONTAINER_USER.

   The user specified here is the user that all storage operations on the
   MapR cluster will be performed as. Therefore, MapR recommends not using
   root or mapr.

   This user also owns the /opt/mapr directory tree.
   MAPR_CONTAINER_UID <uid> The UID that the application inside the Docker
   container will run as. This is a companion to the MAPR_CONTAINER_USER
   option. If a UID is not provided, the default is UID 1000. Providing a
   UID is strongly recommended.
   MAPR_CONTAINER_GROUP <group-name> The group that the application inside
   the Docker container will run as. This is a companion to the
   MAPR_CONTAINER_USER option. If a group name is not provided, the
   default is users. Providing a group name is strongly recommended.
   MAPR_CONTAINER_GID <gid> The GID that the application inside the Docker
   container will run as. This is a companion to the MAPR_CONTAINER_USER
   option. If a GID is not provided, the default is GID 1000. Providing a
   GID is strongly recommended.
   MAPR_PKG_URL <mapr-pkg-url> The URL of the repository that hosts the
   MapR packages (typically package.mapr.com). If you change MAPR_PKG_URL,
   use the full URL to your MapR repository (for example,
   <hostname>/releases).
   MAPR_CONTAINER_PASSWORD <mapr-password> The password for the mapr user.
   This password must be set if the container will remaining running. The
   password defaults to mapr.
   MAPR_STANZA_FILE <stanza-file> The path to a MapR Installer Stanza file
   that needs to be mounted from the host. You must specify this field if
   you issue the Stanza install command as an argument to the script. For
   example:
mapr-docker-installer.sh install -nv

   MAPR_MEMORY <mapr-memory> Specify the maximum amount of memory (in
   kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes) that Docker allows the container to
   access. For example:
     * 2g
     * 4096m
     * 0

   Accepting the default (0), means there is no restriction on memory, and
   the container can use as much memory as the platform makes available.
   MAPR_TZ <time-zone> The time zone inside the container. For a list of
   time-zone settings, see [1]this website. The default is UTC.
