About the MapR Reference Templates for AWS

   The MapR reference templates for AWS are sample CloudFormation
   templates that you can use to set up a MapR cluster. You can use the
   templates without modification, or you can customize them to suit your
   environment. Be sure to review the following information before using
   the reference templates. For more information about CloudFormation, see
   [1]AWS CloudFormation.

   The reference templates can be found on [2]GitHub in folders organized
   by the MapR Installer version. To determine your MapR Installer
   version, see [3]Checking the MapR Installer Version.

   This table describes the AWS reference templates:
   Template Type Template File Name Function
   Primary Template aws_cf_maprcluster_with_role.yml Creates a MapR
   cluster along with all the privileges and roles required by the MapR
   Installer. Use this template if you are privileged to create roles and
   policies in AWS.
   Primary Template aws_cf_maprcluster.yml Creates a MapR cluster. This
   template requires the IAM role to be provided as an input. If you do
   not have the permission to create roles and privileges, ask your
   administrator to create the role for them. The
   aws_cf_maprcluster_role.yml template can be used for this purpose.
   Primary Template aws_cf_maprcluster_ami.yml Creates a MapR cluster. For
   this template, you must provide an AMI ID and ssh user with SUDO
   privilege as inputs. The AMI can be any CentOS, Ubuntu, or SUSE image
   on which the mapr-setup.sh image prep has not been run. The root disk
   (where /opt/mapr will be installed) must have a minimum of 128 GB, and
   swap space must be at least 10% of memory or less than 2 GB. Note that
   the CentOS, Ubuntu, or SUSE version must be a [4]version that is
   supported by MapR 5.2.2.
   Utility Template* aws_cf_maprcluster_role.yml Creates a role with the
   privileges necessary for the MapR Installer to create, modify, and
   release AWS instances. Once the role is created, you can pass the role
   name into the aws_cf_maprcluster.yml template.
   Utility Template* aws_cf_maprcluster_nodes.yml Creates the launch
   configuration and auto-scaling group. If you are doing a custom
   deployment, you can customize this template to your needs.
   Utility Template* aws_cf_vpc_openvpn.yml Deploys a VPC capable of
   supporting a MapR cluster. It can also, optionally, set up an OpenVPN
   Access Server. The OpenVPN Access Server supports two client
   connections for testing purposes. You can buy licenses for the Access
   Server from the [5]OpenVPN website. Once the VPC is created, you can
   pass the subnet ID into any of the deployment templates.
   Sample Stanza Input File mapr-core.yml Provided as a convenience for
   users who need a script-based tool to install MapR software. See
   [6]MapR Installer Stanzas.

   *Utility templates support the main templates. You can modify them to
   suit your needs. Updated utility templates must be uploaded to s3 and
   referenced in your customized primary templates. The main templates
   contain fully-qualified references to the utility templates.
