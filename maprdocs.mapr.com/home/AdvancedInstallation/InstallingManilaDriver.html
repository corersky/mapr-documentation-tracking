Installing MapR-FS Native Driver for Manila

   MapR-FS native driver is a plug-in based on the Shared File Systems
   service and provides high-throughput access to the data on MapR-FS
   distributed file system, which is designed to hold very large amounts
   of data. A Shared File Systems service share in this driver is a volume
   in MapR-FS.

   Before installing the driver, make sure the storage backend and Shared
   File Systems service hosts are in a flat network. Otherwise, the L3
   connectivity between them should exist.
