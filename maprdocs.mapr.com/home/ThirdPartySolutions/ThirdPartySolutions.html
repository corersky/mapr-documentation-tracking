Third Party Solutions

   MapR works with the leaders in the Hadoop ecosystem to provide the most
   powerful data analysis solutions. For more information about our
   partners, take a look at the following pages.

   Starting in the 3.1 release of the MapR software, a dependency
   directory exists at $MAPR_HOME/libexp. This directory contains symbolic
   links to JAR files that many third-party and open source components use
   as dependencies. Add this directory to your CLASSPATH environment
   variable to make these JAR files available to those components.
