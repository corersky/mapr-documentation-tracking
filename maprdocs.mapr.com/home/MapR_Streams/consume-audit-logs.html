Consuming Audit Logs

   Audit Streaming (available from v6.0.1) provides a way to process the
   audit data real-time.

   When audit streaming is enabled, MapR-FS, MapR-DB, and MapR-ES
   operation related audit logs and CLDB and auth audit logs are sent as
   audit stream as the audit data is generated, opening the possibility
   for real-time processing of the audit data. See [1]Streaming Audit Logs
   for more information. The following sections provide information you
   need to use the sample cached and/or uncached consumer applications or
   build your custom consumer application to consume the audit logs that
   are available as stream topic when audit streaming is enabled.
