MapR-ES C#/.NET Applications

   As of MapR 6.0.1/MEP5.0, you can create C#/.NET applications for
   MapR-ES using the MapR-ES C#/.NET client. The MapR-ES C#/.NET client is
   a binding for librdkafka and the MapR-ES C Client is a distribution of
   librdkafka that works with MapR-ES.

Requirements

     * MapR Client on Windows 7 (or higher) x64 operating systems
     * MapR cluster version 6.0.1 or greater
     * Java 8 SDK and set Java HOME
     * MapR-ES C Client (mapr-librdkafka 0.11.3)
     * MapR-ES C#/.NET Client (mapr-streams-dotnet)
     * .NET SDK 4.5.x or 4.6.x or .NET Core SDK 1.1
     * nuget.exe

   See [1]Installing MapR-ES C#/.NET Client for installation information.

General Information

   When developing and running MapR-ES C#/.NET applications, note the
   following points:
     * You can create producers and high-level consumers. Low-level
       consumers are not supported.
     * Consuming or producing topics in a Kafka cluster is not supported.
     * MapR-ES offset values start at 1, not 0.
     * MapR security is supported including ACLs and ACEs for
       authorization. The unique Kafka security features that are part of
       Apache Kafka are not supported. See [2]Security for more
       information about MapR security features.
     * User impersonation is not supported.
