Developing MapR-ES Python Applications

   This topic includes basic information about how to develop a MapR-ES
   Python application and an example program that you can run.

Before you Begin

   Confirm that your environment meets the following requirements:
     * MapR cluster version 5.2.1 or greater.
     * MapR-ES C Client (mapr-librdkafka) is installed and configured on
       the node. See [1]Configuring the MapR-ES C Client.
     * MapR-ES Python Client (mapr-streams-python) is installed on the
       node. See [2]Installing MapR-ES Python Client.
     * Python 2.7.x and greater or Python 3.x and greater is installed on
       the node.

Create a MapR-ES Producer Application

   In general, you want to create a producer that performs the following
   steps:
    1. Import the producer class.
    2. Define the producer and its configuration.
    3. Produce data.
    4. Wait for all messages to be sent to consumer.

   As of MEP 5.0 MapR-ES Python Client: In the following example code,
   three messages are produced to a topic named mytopic in a stream named
   my_stream.
from confluent_kafka import Producer
p = Producer({'streams.producer.default.stream': '/my_stream'})
some_data_source= ["msg1", "msg2", "msg3"]
for data in some_data_source:
     p.produce('mytopic', data.encode('utf-8'))
     p.flush()

   As of MEP 3.0 MapR-ES Python Client: In the following example code,
   three messages are produced to a topic named mytopic in a stream named
   my_stream.
from mapr_streams_python import Producer
p = Producer({'streams.producer.default.stream': '/my_stream'})
some_data_source= ["msg1", "msg2", "msg3"]
for data in some_data_source:
    p.produce('mytopic', data.encode('utf-8'))
    p.flush()

Create a MapR-ES Consumer Application

   In general, you want to create a consumer that performs the following
   steps:
    1. Import the consumer class.
    2. Define the consumer and its configuration.
    3. Consume data.
    4. Wait for all messages to be consumed.

   As of MEP 5.0 MapR-ES Python Client: In following example code, the
   MapR-ES consumer is subscribed to my_stream/mytopic and it prints the
   content of each message that it reads.
from confluent_kafka import Consumer, KafkaError
c = Consumer({'group.id': 'mygroup',
              'default.topic.config': {'auto.offset.reset': 'earliest'}})
c.subscribe(['/my_stream:mytopic'])
running = True
while running:
  msg = c.poll(timeout=1.0)
  if msg is None: continue
  if not msg.error():
    print('Received message: %s' % msg.value().decode('utf-8'))
  elif msg.error().code() != KafkaError._PARTITION_EOF:
    print(msg.error())
    running = False
c.close()

   As of MEP 3.0 MapR-ES Python Client: In following example code, the
   MapR-ES consumer is subscribed to my_stream/mytopic and it prints the
   content of each message that it reads.
from mapr_streams_python import Consumer, KafkaError
c = Consumer({'group.id': 'mygroup',
              'default.topic.config': {'auto.offset.reset': 'earliest'}})
c.subscribe(['/my_stream:mytopic'])
running = True
while running:
  msg = c.poll(timeout=1.0)
  if msg is None: continue
  if not msg.error():
    print('Received message: %s' % msg.value().decode('utf-8'))
  elif msg.error().code() != KafkaError._PARTITION_EOF:
    print(msg.error())
    running = False
c.close()

Run the Example Applications

   To run the sample producer and consumer applications:
    1. Create a stream named mystream.
    2. Create a file named producer.py.
    3. Add the producer example code into the producer.py file.
    4. Create a file named consumer.py.
    5. Add the consumer example code into the consumer.py file.
    6. Verify that you have completed the steps to configure the MapR-ES C
       client or complete the steps now. See [3]Configuring the MapR-ES C
       Client.
       Note: The MapR-ES Python Client is dependent on the MapR-ES C
       Client. Therefore, the MapR-ES C Client must be configured before
       you can run the application.
    7. Run producer.py from the command line to generate messages.
$ python producer.py
    8. Run consumer.py from the command line:
$ python consumer.py
