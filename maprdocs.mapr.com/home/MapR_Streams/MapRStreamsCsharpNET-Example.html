Developing MapR-ES C#/.NET Applications

Before Your Begin

   Confirm that your environment meets the following requirements:
     * MapR cluster version 6.0.1 or greater.
     * MapR-ES C Client (mapr-librdkafka 0.11.3) is installed and
       configured on the node. See [1]Configuring the MapR-ES C Client.
     * MapR-ES C#/.NET Client (mapr-streams-dotnet) is installed on the
       node.
     * .NET SKD 4.5.x or 4.6.x
     * .NET Core SDK 1.1
     * nuget.exe

Create a Producer Application

   In general, you want to create a producer that performs the following
   steps:
    1. Import the producer class.
    2. Define the producer and its configuration.
    3. Produce data.
    4. Wait for all messages to be sent to consumer.

   In the following example code, three messages are produced to a topic
   named mytopic in a stream named my_stream.

Create a Consumer Application

   In general, you want to create a consumer that performs the following
   steps:
    1. Import the consumer class.
    2. Define the consumer and its configuration.
    3. Consume data.
    4. Wait for all messages to be consumed.

   In following example code, the MapR-ES consumer is subscribed to
   my_stream/mytopic and it prints the content of each message that it
   reads.
