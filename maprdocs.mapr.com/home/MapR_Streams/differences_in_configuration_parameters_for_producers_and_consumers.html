Differences between MapR-ES and Apache Kafka Configuration

   Describes the MapR-ES supportability of Apache Kafka configuration
   parameters for producers and consumers.
     * [1]Kafka Producer
     * [2]Kafka Consumer
     * [3]MapR-ES Parameters

   Name Description Supported for producers in MapR-ES?
   bootstrap.servers A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the
   initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of
   all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for
   bootstrapping—this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover
   the full set of servers. This list should be in the form
   host1:port1,host2:port2,.... Since these servers are just used for the
   initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may
   change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers
   (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down). No.
   Cluster details are discovered from the file mapr-clusters.conf.
   key.serializer Serializer class for key that implements the Serializer
   interface. Yes
   value.serializer Serializer class for value that implements the
   Serializer interface. Yes
   acks The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to
   have received before considering a request complete. This controls the
   durability of records that are sent. The following settings are common:
   Ignored, all writes in MapR-ES are synchronous, and number of replicas
   is determined at the volume level, with a default of 3.
   acks=0

   If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment
   from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the
   socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the
   server has received the record in this case, and the retries
   configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know
   of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be
   set to -1.
   acks=1

   This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but
   will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers.
   In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the
   record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will
   be lost.
   acks=all

   This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to
   acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be
   lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the
   strongest available guarantee.
   buffer.memory The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer
   records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster
   than they can be delivered to the server the producer will either block
   or throw an exception based on the preference specified by
   block.on.buffer.full. Yes
   This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer
   will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer
   uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for
   compression (if compression is enabled) as well as for maintaining
   in-flight requests.
   compression.type The compression type for all data generated by the
   producer. The default is none (i.e. no compression). Valid values are
   none, gzip, snappy, or lz4. Compression is of full batches of data, so
   the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more
   batching means better compression). Ignored. Compression is configured
   per stream.
   retries Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to
   resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error.
   Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the
   record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries will potentially
   change the ordering of records because if two records are sent to a
   single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second
   succeeds, then the second record may appear first. Ignored. MapR-ES
   always does automatic retries on transient errors.
   ssl.key.password The password of the private key in the key store file.
   This is optional for client. Ignored. Authentication and authorization
   are handled through MapR security. See the [4]Security.
   ssl.keystore.location The location of the key store file. This is
   optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for
   client. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through
   MapR security. See the [5]Security.
   ssl.keystore.password The store password for the key store file.This is
   optional for client and only needed if ssl.keystore.location is
   configured. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled
   through MapR security. See the [6]Security.
   ssl.truststore.location The location of the trust store file. Ignored.
   Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR security. See
   the [7]Security.
   ssl.truststore.password The password for the trust store file. Ignored.
   Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR security. See
   the [8]Security.
   batch.size The producer will attempt to batch records together into
   fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same
   partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server.
   This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. Ignored.
   MapR always batches records for optimal performance.
   No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size.
   Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each
   partition with data available to be sent.
   A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce
   throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely). A
   very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we will
   always allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of
   additional records.
   client.id An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The
   purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond
   just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in
   server-side request logging. Yes
   connections.max.idle.ms Close idle connections after the number of
   milliseconds specified by this config. Ignored.
   linger.ms The producer groups together any records that arrive in
   between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally
   this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be
   sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce
   the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting
   accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay—that is,
   rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for
   up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the
   sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to
   Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the
   delay for batching: once we get batch.size worth of records for a
   partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting,
   however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this
   partition we will 'linger' for the specified time waiting for more
   records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay). Setting
   linger.ms=5, for example, would have the effect of reducing the number
   of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in
   the absense of load. Ignored.
   max.block.ms The configuration controls how long {@link
   KafkaProducer#send()} and {@link KafkaProducer#partitionsFor} will
   block. These methods can be blocked for multiple reasons. For e.g:
   buffer full, metadata unavailable.This configuration imposes maximum
   limit on the total time spent in fetching metadata, serialization of
   key and value, partitioning and allocation of buffer memory when doing
   a send(). In case of partitionsFor(), this configuration imposes a
   maximum time threshold on waiting for metadata Ignored. MapR-ES has a
   similar parameter: streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   max.request.size The maximum size of a request. This is also
   effectively a cap on the maximum record size. Note that the server has
   its own cap on record size which may be different from this. This
   setting will limit the number of record batches the producer will send
   in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. Ignored.
   partitioner.class Partitioner class that implements the Partitioner
   interface. Use the [9]StreamsPartitioner interface.
   receive.buffer.bytes The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to
   use when reading data. Ignored.
   request.timeout.ms The configuration controls the maximum amount of
   time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the
   response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will
   resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are
   exhausted. Ignored. MapR-ES has a similar parameter:
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   sasl.kerberos.service.name The Kerberos principal name that Kafka runs
   as. This can be defined either in Kafka's JAAS config or in Kafka's
   config. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through
   MapR security. See the [10]Security.
   security.protocol Protocol used to communicate with brokers. Currently
   only PLAINTEXT and SSL are supported. Ignored. Authentication and
   authorization are handled through MapR security. See the [11]Security.
   send.buffer.bytes The size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use
   when sending data. Ignored.
   ssl.enabled.protocols The list of protocols enabled for SSL
   connections. TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1 are enabled by default.
   Ignored.
   ssl.keystore.type The file format of the key store file. This is
   optional for client. Default value is JKS Ignored. Authentication and
   authorization are handled through MapR security. See the [12]Security.
   ssl.protocol The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. Default
   setting is TLS, which is fine for most cases. Allowed values in recent
   JVMs are TLS, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2. SSL, SSLv2 and SSLv3 may be
   supported in older JVMs, but their usage is discouraged due to known
   security vulnerabilities. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are
   handled through MapR security. See the [13]Security.
   ssl.provider The name of the security provider used for SSL
   connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM.
   Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR
   security. See the [14]Security.
   ssl.truststore.type The file format of the trust store file. Default
   value is JKS. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled
   through MapR security. See the [15]Security.
   timeout.ms The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the
   server will wait for acknowledgments from followers to meet the
   acknowledgment requirements the producer has specified with the acks
   configuration. If the requested number of acknowledgments are not met
   when the timeout elapses an error will be returned. This timeout is
   measured on the server side and does not include the network latency of
   the request. Ignored. MapR-ES has a similar parameter:
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   block.on.buffer.full When our memory buffer is exhausted we must either
   stop accepting new records (block) or throw errors. By default this
   setting is true and we block, however in some scenarios blocking is not
   desirable and it is better to immediately give an error. Setting this
   to false will accomplish that: the producer will throw a
   BufferExhaustedException if a recrord is sent and the buffer space is
   full. Ignored.
   max.in.flight.requests.per.connection The maximum number of
   unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection
   before blocking. Note that if this setting is set to be greater than 1
   and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due
   to retries (i.e., if retries are enabled). Ignored. MapR-ES has a
   similar parameter: streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition
   metadata.fetch.timeout.ms The first time data is sent to a topic we
   must fetch metadata about that topic to know which servers host the
   topic's partitions. This fetch to succeed before throwing an exception
   back to the client. Ignored.
   metadata.max.age.ms The period of time in milliseconds after which we
   force a refresh of metadata even if we haven't seen any partition
   leadership changes to proactively discover any new brokers or
   partitions. Yes
   metric.reporters A list of classes to use as metrics reporters.
   Implementing the MetricReporter interface allows plugging in classes
   that will be notified of new metric creation. The JmxReporter is always
   included to register JMX statistics. No
   metrics.num.samples The number of samples maintained to compute
   metrics. No.
   metrics.sample.window.ms The number of samples maintained to compute
   metrics. No.
   reconnect.backoff.ms The amount of time to wait before attempting to
   reconnect to a given host. This avoids repeatedly connecting to a host
   in a tight loop. This backoff applies to all requests sent by the
   consumer to the broker. Ignored. MapR-ES has a similar parameter:
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   retry.backoff.ms The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry
   a failed fetch request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeated
   fetching-and-failing in a tight loop. Ignored. MapR-ES has a similar
   parameter: streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd Kerberos kinit command path. Default is
   /usr/bin/kinit Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled
   through MapR security. See the [16]Security.
   sasl.kerberos.min.time.before.relogin Login thread sleep time between
   refresh attempts. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled
   through MapR security. See the [17]Security.
   sasl.kerberos.ticket.renew.jitter Percentage of random jitter added to
   the renewal time. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled
   through MapR security. See the [18]Security.
   sasl.kerberos.ticket.renew.window.factor Login thread will sleep until
   the specified window factor of time from last refresh to ticket's
   expiry has been reached, at which time it will try to renew the ticket.
   Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR
   security. See the [19]Security.
   ssl.cipher.suites A list of cipher suites. This is a named combination
   of authentication, encryption, MAC and key exchange algorithm used to
   negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or
   SSL network protocol.By default all the available cipher suites are
   supported. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled
   through MapR security. See the [20]Security.
   ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm The endpoint identification
   algorithm to validate server hostname using server certificate.
   Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR
   security. See the [21]Security.
   ssl.keymanager.algorithm The algorithm used by key manager factory for
   SSL connections. Default value is the key manager factory algorithm
   configured for the Java Virtual Machine. Ignored. Authentication and
   authorization are handled through MapR security. See the [22]Security.
   ssl.trustmanager.algorithm The algorithm used by trust manager factory
   for SSL connections. Default value is the trust manager factory
   algorithm configured for the Java Virtual Machine. Ignored.
   Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR security. See
   the [23]Security.
   Name Description Supported for consumers in MapR-ES?
   bootstrap.servers A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the
   initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of
   all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for
   bootstrapping—this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover
   the full set of servers. This list should be in the form
   host1:port1,host2:port2,.... Since these servers are just used for the
   initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may
   change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers
   (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down). No.
   Cluster details are discovered from the file mapr-clusters.conf.
   key.deserializer Deserializer class for key that implements the
   Deserializer interface. Yes
   value.deserializer Deserializer class for value that implements the
   Deserializer interface. Yes
   fetch.min.bytes The minimum amount of data the server should return for
   a fetch request. If insufficient data is available the request will
   wait for that much data to accumulate before answering the request. The
   default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as
   soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times
   out waiting for data to arrive. Setting this to something greater than
   1 will cause the server to wait for larger amounts of data to
   accumulate which can improve server throughput a bit at the cost of
   some additional latency. Yes
   fetch.max.bytes The maximum amount of data the server should return for
   a fetch request. If the first record batch in the first non-empty
   partition of the fetch is larger than this configuration, the record
   batch is still returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress.
   Note: This is new as of MapR 6.0.1.
   Yes, as of MapR 6.0.1.
   group.id A unique string that identifies the consumer group this
   consumer belongs to. This property is required if the consumer uses
   either the group management functionality by using subscribe(topic) or
   the Kafka-based offset management strategy. Yes
   heartbeat.interval.ms The expected time between heartbeats to the
   consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities.
   Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active
   and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the
   group. The value must be set lower than session.timeout.ms, but
   typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be
   adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.
   No
   max.poll.records Places an upper bound on the number of records
   returned from each call.
   Note: This parameter is new as of MapR 6.0.1.
   Yes, as of MapR 6.0.1.
   max.partition.fetch.bytes The maximum amount of data per-partition the
   server will return. The maximum total memory used for a request will be
   #partitions * max.partition.fetch.bytes. This size must be at least as
   large as the maximum message size the server allows or else it is
   possible for the producer to send messages larger than the consumer can
   fetch. If that happens, the consumer can get stuck trying to fetch a
   large message on a certain partition.
   If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch
   is larger than this configuration, the record batch is still returned
   to ensure that the consumer can make progress.
   Note: This is a behavior change as of MapR 6.0.1.
   Yes
   session.timeout.ms The timeout used to detect failures when using
   Kafka's group management facilities. Ignored
   ssl.key.password The password of the private key in the key store file.
   This is optional for client. Ignored. Authentication and authorization
   are handled through MapR security. See the [24]Security.
   ssl.keystore.location The location of the key store file. This is
   optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for
   client. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through
   MapR security. See the [25]Security.
   ssl.keystore.password The store password for the key store file.This is
   optional for client and only needed if ssl.keystore.location is
   configured. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled
   through MapR security. See the [26]Security.
   ssl.truststore.location The location of the trust store file. Ignored.
   Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR security. See
   the [27]Security.
   ssl.truststore.password The password for the trust store file. Ignored.
   Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR security. See
   the [28]Security.
   auto.offset.reset

   What to do when there is no initial offset in Kafka or if the current
   offset does not exist any more on the server (e.g. because that data
   has been deleted):

   earliest
          automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset

   latest
          automatically reset the offset to the latest offset

   none
          throw exception to the consumer if no previous offset is found
          for the consumer's group

   anything else
          throw exception to the consumer.

   Yes
   connections.max.idle.ms Close idle connections after the number of
   milliseconds specified by this config. Ignored
   enable.auto.commit If true the consumer's offset will be periodically
   committed in the background. Yes
   partition.assignment.strategy The class name of the partition
   assignment strategy that the client will use to distribute partition
   ownership amongst consumer instances when group management is used
   Ignored. MapR-ES distributes partitions equally among the consumers in
   a group.
   receive.buffer.bytes The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to
   use when reading data. Ignored.
   request.timeout.ms The configuration controls the maximum amount of
   time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the
   response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will
   resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are
   exhausted. Ignored. MapR-ES has a similar parameter:
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   sasl.kerberos.service.name The Kerberos principal name that Kafka runs
   as. This can be defined either in Kafka's JAAS config or in Kafka's
   config. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through
   MapR security. See the [29]Security.
   security.protocol Protocol used to communicate with brokers. Currently
   only PLAINTEXT and SSL are supported. Ignored. Authentication and
   authorization are handled through MapR security. See the [30]Security.
   send.buffer.bytes The size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use
   when sending data. Ignored.
   ssl.enabled.protocols The list of protocols enabled for SSL
   connections. TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1 are enabled by default.
   Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR
   security. See the [31]Security.
   ssl.keystore.type The file format of the key store file. This is
   optional for client. Default value is JKS Ignored. Authentication and

   setting is TLS, which is fine for most cases. Allowed values in recent
   JVMs are TLS, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2. SSL, SSLv2 and SSLv3 may be
   supported in older JVMs, but their usage is discouraged due to known
   security vulnerabilities. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are
   handled through MapR security. See the [33]Security.

   connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM.
   Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled through MapR
   security. See the [34]Security.
   ssl.truststore.type The file format of the trust store file. Default
   value is JKS. Ignored. Authentication and authorization are handled
   through MapR security. See the [35]Security.
   auto.commit.interval.ms The frequency in milliseconds that the consumer
   offsets are auto-committed to Kafka if enable.auto.commit is set to
   true. Yes
   check.crcs Automatically check the CRC32 of the records consumed. This
   ensures no on-the-wire or on-disk corruption to the messages occurred.
   This check adds some overhead, so it may be disabled in cases seeking
   extreme performance.

   Ignored.

   MapR-ES always does end-to-end crc computation and verification.
   client.id An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The
   purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond
   just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in
   server-side request logging. Yes
   fetch.max.wait.ms The maximum amount of time the server will block
   before answering the fetch request if there isn't sufficient data to
   immediately satisfy the requirement given by fetch.min.bytes. No

   reconnect.backoff.ms The amount of time to wait before attempting to
   reconnect to a given host. This avoids repeatedly connecting to a host
   in a tight loop. This backoff applies to all requests sent by the
   consumer to the broker. Ignored. MapR-ES has a similar parameter:
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   retry.backoff.ms The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry
   a failed fetch request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeated
   fetching-and-failing in a tight loop. Ignored. MapR-ES has a similar
   parameter: streams.rpc.timeout.ms

   The following MapR-ES parameters are for the Admin API.

   CAPTION: Table 1. MapR-ES Parameter for Admin

   MapR-ES Parameter Description Kafka Parameter Replaced
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms Specifies the length of time in milliseconds to
   wait for a response from the MapR-ES server if soft mount is configured
   (fs.mapr.hardmount is set to false). Default: 120000 Minimum: 30000
   Note: Applicable as of MapR 6.0.1, is used instead of
   fs.mapr.rpc.timeout

   request.timeout.ms

   reconnect.backoff.ms

   retry.backoff.ms

   The following MapR-Es parameter are for the Producer API:

   CAPTION: Table 2. MapR-ES Parameters for Producer

   MapR-ES Parameter Description Kafka Parameter Replaced
   streams.buffer.max.time.ms

   Messages are buffered in the producer for at most the specified time. A
   thread will flush all the messages that have been buffered for more
   than the time specified.

   Default: 3 * 1000 msec
   linger.ms
   streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition

   If enabled, producer may have multiple parallel send requests to the
   server for each topic partition. If this setting is set to true, it is
   possible for messages to be sent out of order.

   Default: true
   max.in.flight.requests.per.connection
   streams.partitioner.class The class that implements the
   StreamsPartitioner interface. This interface lets you write custom
   algorithms for determining which topic and partition to use for
   messages that match specific criteria. Use this configuration parameter
   only for producers that are written in Java. Not applicable.
   streams.producer.default.stream

   Specifies the stream that the producer will use by default if the
   producer does not provide the name of a stream when specifying a topic
   to write to.

   For example, the producer can specify the name of a stream together
   with the name of a topic to write to, like this:

   /<stream>/<topic>

   However, if the stream is not specified, the value of this
   configuration parameter is assumed to be the stream in which the topic
   is located.

   If the producer specifies the name of a topic without also providing
   the path and name of the stream, and there is no value for this
   configuration parameter, MapR-ES assumes that the topic specified is in
   Apache Kafka and does nothing.
   Not applicable.
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms Specifies the length of time in milliseconds to
   wait for a response from the MapR-ES server if soft mount is configured
   (fs.mapr.hardmount is set to false). Default: 30000 Minimum: 30000
   If the time expires while a producer waits for a response from the
   MapR-ES server, and the producer used the
   KafkaProducer.send(ProducerRecord<K,V> record, Callback callback)
   method, the callback is invoked with the error EAGAIN, which means
   "Resource temporarily unavailable."
   Note: Applicable as of MapR 6.0.1, is used instead of
   fs.mapr.rpc.timeout

   max.block.ms

   request.timeout.ms

   streams.consumer.default.stream

   Specifies the path and name of the stream that the consumer subscribes
   to if, when subscribing to a topic, the consumer does not specify a
   stream.

   This default value is also used for the KafkaConsumer.listTopics()
   method.
   Not applicable.
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms Specifies the length of time in milliseconds to
   wait for a response from the MapR-ES server if a soft mount is
   configured (fs.mapr.hardmount is set to false). Default: 305000
   Minimum: 300000
   Note: Applicable as of MapR 6.0.1, is used instead of
   fs.mapr.rpc.timeout

   request.timeout.ms

   reconnect.backoff.ms

   retry.backoff.ms
