Monitoring Producers

   To get a sense of how quickly producers are sending messages to the
   producer client library, you can run the command stream topic info at
   intervals.

   Doing so will show you changes over time in the rate at which the
   values for maxoffset and maxtimestamp increase for the partitions in
   the topics that your producers are publishing to.

   For example, if you have a script that runs the command at intervals of
   10 seconds, the change per second would be (Value at first run - Value
   at second run)/10.

   This is an indirect measure of the speed of the producers because the
   producer client library batches messages before publishing them to
   partitions. The faster the producers send messages to the client, the
   faster the client publishes message batches, and the greater the change
   per second.

   If producers do not seem to be sending messages quickly enough, and
   this problem is not caused by server-side I/O bottlenecks, you can
   spawn more producer threads.

   See [1]stream topic info for the syntax of this command.
