Modes of Publishing

   The producer client library batches messages into publish requests that
   it sends to the MapR-ES server. By default, the client sends multiple
   publish requests without waiting for acknowledgements from the MapR-ES
   server. This behavior is determined by the producer configuration
   parameter streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition, which defaults to
   true.

   With this behavior turned on, it is possible for messages to be
   published to the partitions out of order due to the presence of
   multiple network interface controllers, network errors, or retries.

   For example, suppose a producer is sending messages that are
   specifically for Partition 1. The producer client library buffers the
   messages and sends a batch to Partition 1. Meanwhile, the producer
   keeps sending messages for Partition 1 and the client continues to
   buffer them. The next time the producer client library has enough
   messages for Partition 1, the client sends another batch, whether or
   not the MapR-ES server has acknowledged the previous batch.

   If you always want messages to arrive to partitions in the order in
   which they were sent, set the configuration parameter
   streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition to false, which causes the
   producer client library to wait for acknowledgements from the MapR-ES
   server before sending subsequent publish requests.
