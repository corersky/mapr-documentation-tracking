Topic Creation

   Topics are created in streams and contain logical collections of
   messages. They can be created either automatically through your
   producer application or manually through the MCS or maprcli.

Automatic Creation

   If the topic does not already exist, a topic is created automatically
   when a producer first publishes a message to it. This is the default
   behavior.

   For example, you created the stream anonymous_usage that you intend to
   use to collect data about the usage of a software application that is
   soon to be released. However, you did not create any stream topics
   because the topics were not known at the time. After the software is
   released to the public, at some point, a producer application starts
   publishing messages to a topic that is created based on the range
   within which the producer's IP address falls. At another point in time,
   another producer application starts publishing messages to a topic
   based on a different range of IP addresses. Eventually, the stream
   contains a number of topics for different IP address ranges.
   Note: Automatic creation of topics can be turned off by setting the
   autocreate parameter to false either when creating the stream or by
   editing the stream. See the maprcli [1]stream create or [2]stream edit
   command for more information. If you turn off automatic creation, you
   must manually create the stream topic, otherwise, the publishing of a
   message fails.

Manual Creation

   To create topics manually, use either the MCS or maprcli. See
   [3]Administering Streams for information about managing MapR-ES
   streams, topics and replication. See the [4]stream topic create command
   for specific information about creating stream topics with maprcli.

   For example, you created a stream called systemMetrics that you intend
   to use to collect operational metrics from systems in your enterprise.
   You did create several topics based on system, location, company
   department, project, or some other criterion. In this case, you could
   create topics in advance because they were pre-planned.
   Note: When you manually create a topic, you can have the option of
   customizing the number of topic partitions used, otherwise, the default
   number of partitions is inherited from the stream.
