Consuming CDC Records

   Changed data records (propagated by the Change Data Capture feature)
   are consumed by using OJAI changelog interfaces.

   The following topics provide information you need to understand the CDC
   feature, to setup and use CDC, the maprcli commands used performing
   tasks, and to consume the data via your application.

   The following diagram shows the big picture flow of setting up CDC and
   consuming CDC changed data records. This diagram provides hotspot
   links.

Deserializer for consuming CDC records

   The MapR ChangeData deserializer must be registered when creating a CDC
   consumer. The deserializer converts the stream messages into individual
   change data records. It is a MapR custom Kafka consumer that polls for
   Map-ES changed data records from a MapR-ES stream topic. The
   deserializer is registered by setting the value.deserializer
   configuration parameter. to
   com.mapr.db.cdc.ChangeDataRecordDeserializer.

Interfaces for working with CDC records

   The following OJAI interfaces and enumerations are used to create a
   consumer for CDC changed data.
     * [3]ChangeNode - This interface contains the change to a single
       field in a document.
     * [4]ChangeEvent - This interface identifies the change event
       associated with the current change node. The values of ChangeEvent
       can be one of the following:
          + NULL (no event)
          + NODE (a change with real value)
          + START_MAP (a node representing the beginning of a map)
          + END_MAP (a node representing the end of a map)
          + START_ARRAY (a node representing the beginning of an array)
          + END_ARRAY(a node representing the end of an array)
     * [5]ChangeOp - This interface identifies the type of the operation
       made on the current field. The values of ChangeOp can be one of the
       following:
          + NULL (no operation)
          + SET (replace the current field with the given value)
          + PUT(add an extra version of the value)
          + MERGE (combine the given value with the existing values in the
            table)
          + DELETE (delete all values older than or equal to the delete
            operation timestamp were deleted)
          + DELETE_EXACT (delete the version of the value with the given
            timestamp)
     * [6]ChangeDataRecord - This interface contains all the changes that
       were performed on a single document/row in the source table.
     * [7]ChangeDataRecordType - This interface specifies the mode of
       change for the change data record. The following values are
       specified:
          + RECORD_INSERT
          + RECORD_UPDATE
          + RECORD_DELETE
     * [8]ChangeDataReader - This interface is a parser that traverses
       over the individual change tree nodes on a change data record. It
       provides a cursor-like semantics which can be moved, one tree node
       at a time by invoking the next method.
       The properties of individual change node (for example: data type,
       field name, field value, and so on) can be retrieved using various
       methods of this interface.
