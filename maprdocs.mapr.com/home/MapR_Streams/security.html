Stream Security

   Topics in a stream are protected from unauthorized access by the
   adminperm, copyperm, comsumeperm, produceperm, and topicperm security
   permissions. In addition, user impersonation is also supported.

ACE Permissions

   The following access-control expressions (ACE) are used to protect
   topics in stream from unauthorized access. ACEs are set when you create
   or edit a stream.

   adminperm
          Determines which users can modify access-control expressions for
          a stream, set up replication of a stream, and modify other
          attributes of a stream.

   copyperm
          Determines which users can run the mapr copystream and mapr
          diffstreams utilities on the stream.
          Users with this permission can publish messages to topics in a
          stream, read messages in topics from a stream, and create or
          remove topics in a stream. This permission is a combination
          consumeperm, produceperm, and topicperm.

   consumeperm
          Determines which users can read messages in topics from a
          stream.

   produceperm
          Determines which users can publish messages to topics in a
          stream.

   topicperm
          Determines which users can create topics in a stream or remove
          them.

   The following example shows the adminperm, consumeperm, produceperm,
   and topicperm permissions on a stream named traffic_sensors, which
   includes the topics traffic_sensors_sf and traffic_sensors_ny.

   Syntax.

User Impersonation

   MapR-ES supports user impersonation through the Java API. See
   [2]MapR-ES Java Applications for more information. MapR-ES does not
   support user impersonation through the C API or Python API.
   Note: Kafka REST supports outbound user impersonation. See [3]User
   Impersonation for more information.
