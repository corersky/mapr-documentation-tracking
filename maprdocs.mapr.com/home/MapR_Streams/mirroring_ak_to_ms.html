Mirroring Topics from an Apache Kafka Cluster to a MapR Cluster

   You can use MirrorMaker to mirror data continuously from Apache Kafka
   clusters to MapR streams in MapR clusters.
     * Because this procedure requires that MirrorMaker be run from the
       MapR cluster, ensure that the mapr-kafka package is installed on
       the node that you choose to run MirrorMaker from.
     * Configure the node as a MapR client.
     * Ensure that the ID of the user that runs MirrorMaker has the
       produceperm and topicperm permissions on the destination MapR
       stream.

   Alternatively, you can stop mirroring after you migrate the consumers
   and producers for your applications from your Apache Kafka cluster to
   your MapR cluster where the stream is located. See in [1]Migrating
   Apache Kafka 0.9.0 Applications to MapR-ES for details. After you start
   MirrorMaker, it launches a configurable number of consumer threads to
   read topics that are in a Kafka cluster and a number of producers to
   write the messages from those topics into topics in a MapR stream in a
   MapR cluster.

   Before running MirrorMaker, you create a file that contains the
   required configuration parameters for the consumers that read from the
   Apache Kafka cluster. You also create a file that contains the required
   configuration parameters for the producers that publish to the stream
   in the MapR cluster. You point to these files in the MirrorMaker
   command.

   You can either specify the topics to mirror or the topics not to
   mirror. In the former case, you use the whitelist parameter to provide
   a Java-style regular expression that matches the names of the topics
   that you want to mirror. In the latter case, you use the blacklist
   parameter to provide a Java-style regular expression that matches the
   names of the topics that you do not want to mirror.
    1. Create a file that contains the required properties and values for
       consumers to use. When you run MirrorMaker, you point to this file
       by using the consumer.config parameter.
       The descriptions of these properties, except for the last, are
       taken from the documentation for Apache Kafka. The last property is
       not documented.

   Property Description
   zookeeper.connect The IP address and port number of the ZooKeeper
   instance for the Apache Kafka cluster.
   zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms The max time that the MirrorMaker waits
   to establish a connection to Zookeeper.
   group.id A unique string that identifies the consumer group the
   consumers started by MirrorMaker belong to.
   bootstrap.servers A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the
   initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of
   all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for
   bootstrappingâ€”this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover
   the full set of servers. This list should be in the form
   host1:port1,host2:port2,.... Since these servers are just used for the
   initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may
   change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers
   (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).
    2. Create a file that contains the required properties and values for
       producers to use. When you run MirrorMaker, you point to this file
       by using the producer.config parameter.

   Property Description
   streams.producer.default.stream Specifies the path and name of the
   stream in the MapR cluster that the topics will be mirrored to.
   auto.create.topics.enable Set the value to true. The producers will
   therefore be able to create topics in the destination stream
   automatically.
    3. Run MirrorMaker with this command to start mirroring topics from
       Apache Kafka to MapR-ES:
       Syntax
/opt/mapr/kafka/kafka-0.9.0/bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.MirrorMaker
--consumer.config <File that lists consumer properties and values>
--num.streams <Number of consumer threads>
--producer.config <File that lists producer properties and values>
[--whitelist=<Java-style regular expression for specifying the topics to mirror>
]
[--blacklist=<Java-style regular expression for specifying the topics not to mir
ror>]

   Parameter Description
   consumer.config The path and name of the file that lists the consumer
   properties and their values.
   num.streams Use this option to specify the number of mirror consumer
   threads to create. Note that if you start multiple mirror maker
   processes then you may want to look at the distribution of partitions
   on the source cluster. If the number of consumption streams is too high
   per mirror maker process, then some of the mirroring threads will be
   idle by virtue of the consumer rebalancing algorithm (if they do not
   end up owning any partitions for consumption).
   producer.config The path and name of the file that lists the producer
   properties and their values.
   whitelist A Java-style regular expression for specifying the topics to
   copy. Commas (',') are interpreted as the regex-choice symbol ('|').

   If you use this parameter, do not use the blacklist parameter.
   blacklist A Java-style regular expression for specifying the topics not
   to copy. Commas (',') are interpreted as the regex-choice symbol ('|').

   If you use this parameter, do not use the whitelist parameter.

Example

   In this example, the file that lists the properties and values for the
   consumers that will read messages from the topics in Apache Kafka is
   named consumers.props. It contains this list:
zookeeper.connect=10.10.102.34:2181
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000
group.id=cg.1
bootstrap.servers=10.10.100.87:9093
shallow.iterator.enable=false

   The file that lists the properties and values for the producers that
   will publish messages to topics in MapR-ES is named producers.props. It
   contains this list:
streams.producer.default.stream=/newStream
auto.create.topics.enable=true

   The topics to mirror all have names that begin with na_west. When
   running the command, we can use "na_west*" as the regular expression to
   use for the whitelist parameter.

   Here is the command:
bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.MirrorMaker --consumer.config consumers.props

--num.streams 2 --producer.config producers.props --whitelist="na_west*"
