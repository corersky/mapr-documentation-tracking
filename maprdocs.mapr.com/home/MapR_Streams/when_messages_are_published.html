How Messages are Published

   To publish a message, a producer sends a record to the producer client
   library, which batches the records before sending them to the server.

   The producer client library sends the records to the server when any of
   the following conditions are met:
     * The producer client library has batched enough messages to make an
       efficient remote procedure call (RPC) to the server.
     * A message has been queued for the amount of time that is specified
       for the streams.buffer.max.time.ms configuration parameter.
       The default interval for flushes is 3000 milliseconds.
     * The producer client library has batched messages beyond the value
       of the buffer.memory configuration parameter.
     * The application explicitly flushes messages.

   Tip: The default number of threads used for flushing messages is 64. In
   most cases, this number provides excellent performance. However, you
   can adjust this number by setting a value for the fs.mapr.threads
   parameter in the core-site.xml file on your client node.
