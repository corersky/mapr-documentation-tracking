How Partitions are Chosen for Messages

   Because the number of partitions in a topic can change over time,
   producers regularly refresh the information that they have about the
   topics that they know of. This refresh interval is controlled by the
   metadata.max.age.ms configuration parameter.

   Partitions of a topic are identified by their index number. For
   example, if a topic has four partitions, their IDs are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   There following are different ways that partitions are chosen for a
   message:
     * If the producer specifies a partition ID or if the
       StreamsPartitioner interface specifies one, the MapR-ES server
       publishes the message to the partition specified.
     * If the producer does not specify a partition ID but provides a key,
       the MapR-ES server hashes the key and sends the message to the
       partition that corresponds to the hash.
     * If neither a partition ID nor a key is specified, the MapR-ES
       server randomly chooses an initial partition and sends messages in
       a sticky round robin fashion. .
       For example, suppose that for topic traffic_sensors, the server
       chooses Partition 1. The server then accumulates enough messages
       for an RPC of optimal size and sends the batch of messages to
       Partition 1. The server then does the same with Partition 2, and so
       on, eventually returning to Partition 1.
