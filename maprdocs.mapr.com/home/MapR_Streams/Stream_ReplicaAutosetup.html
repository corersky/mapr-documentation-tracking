Replica Autosetup for Streams

   The option to automatically set up stream replication, also known as
   replica autosetup, performs the steps to set up and start the
   replication of streams. The replica autosetup option is available
   through the MCS and CLI.
   In general, replica autosetup performs the following steps to set up
   replication:
    1. Creates a stream in the destination cluster.
    2. Declares the new stream to be a replica of the source stream and
       ensures that replication does not begin immediately after the next
       step.
    3. Declares the source stream as the original of the replica stream.
    4. Loads a copy of the source stream into the replica.
    5. For multi-master replication, replica autosetup declares the source
       stream to be a replica of the new stream and then declares the new
       stream to be an upstream source for the source stream.
    6. Clears the paused replication state to start replication.

   By default, replica autosetup uses the directcopy option. However,
   based on how you run replica autosetup, you also have the option not to
   use directcopy.

Replica Autosetup with Directcopy (default)

   The directcopy option uses gateways to perform all setup operations
   including the initial population of data into the replica stream.
   Directcopy is the default option when you setup stream replication
   using the MCS or with the maprcli stream replica autosetup command.

   When a client submits a request to automatically setup stream
   replication to the cluster, the source cluster acknowledges the request
   and begins to track the replica autosetup request from start to finish.

   If a failure occurs when replica autosetup operations are in progress,
   the source cluster resumes operations from the point of failure.
   Note: To check the replication status of a stream, run the [1]stream
   replica list command. To stop the automatic setup of stream
   replication, run [2]stream replica remove, or delete the source or
   replica stream.
   Replica autosetup with directcopy provides the following benefits:
     * Replica autosetup operations do not block the client from
       submitting additional requests. When setting up stream replication,
       the process to copy source data to the replica can be time
       consuming. The client does not need to wait for the replica
       autosetup request to complete before submitting another request.
     * Source cluster retries replica autosetup operations in case of
       failure. The source cluster keeps track of the replica autosetup
       progress. This allows the source cluster to resume autosetup
       operations in the event of an intermittent failure. If you choose
       to not use directcopy, user intervention is required if a failure
       occurs.
     * Throttling of copy table operations is done by default. Throttling
       prevents the initial copy of data from the source to the replica
       stream from consuming all cluster resources.

Replica Autosetup without Directcopy (not default)

   Without the directcopy option, replica autosetup submits a majority of
   the replication setup requests through the client and then runs the
   mapr copystream utility to populate the initial table data. To use
   replica autosetup without the directcopy option, run maprcli stream
   replica autosetup command with the -directcopy parameter set to false.

   Without the directcopy option, once a client submits an replica
   autosetup request to the cluster, it must wait until the source cluster
   sends a notification that the autosetup request is complete before it
   can submit another request to the cluster. In this case, replica
   autosetup uses the client connection to submit autosetup operation
   requests such as create replica, add replica, and add upstream source.
   Then, to populate the initial table data, it runs mapr copystream.

   If a failure occurs when replica autosetup operations are in progress,
   the client hangs and any replica streams that were created during the
   failed autosetup operations must be manually deleted before you can try
   to setup replication again.
