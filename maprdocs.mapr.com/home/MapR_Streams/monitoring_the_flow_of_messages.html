Monitoring Streams

   The speed at which messages flow from producers to partitions and from
   partitions to consumers depends on the performance of your producers,
   the cluster nodes hosting partitions, and your consumers.

   You can monitor streams in the MapR Control System and using the CLI.

Monitoring Streams Operations Using the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and click Data > Streams.
   The Top Utilization pane displays the nodes that process (produce or
   consume) the most number of messages. By default, the pane displays the
   utilization metrics for the last 24 hours. You can view utilization
   metrics for a time range by choosing the time range from the dropdown
   menu (which can be for the last 15 minutes, last hour, last 12 hours,
   last 7 days, last 30 days, or last 90 days) or select a custom time
   range.
