Topic Partitions

   Partitions, which exist within topics, are parallel, ordered, immutable
   sequences of messages that are continually appended to.

   Topics can contain multiple partitions, which make topics scalable by
   spreading the load for a topic across multiple servers.

   Downstream applications that read messages can read from multiple
   partitions within a topic for faster performance than would be possible
   if they read from a single partition per topic. Downstream applications
   can also scale by having separate instances read from separate
   partitions.

   When creating or editing a stream, a default number of partitions can
   be specified for that stream's topics. Topics inherit the stream's
   partition default, however, topics can also override the stream's
   partition default by setting the number of partitions to be used.

Performance

   The default number of partitions for MapR-DB streams and topics can
   impact performance. Depending on the volume of messages being published
   to a topic, the default number of partitions might be increased for
   efficient consumption.
   When there is a high volume of messages being published to a topic:
     * Multiple consumers, in consumer groups, reading from multiple
       partitions are handled more efficiently.
     * Individual consumers each reading from a single partition are
       handled less efficiently.

       streams with the -defaultpartitions parameter.

       streams with the -defaultpartitions parameter.

       creating topics with the -partitions parameter.

       modifying topics with the -partitions parameter.
     * See the maprcli [5]stream topic info for information about topic
       data including the -partitions parameter.

       and edit streams and to create and edit topics.
