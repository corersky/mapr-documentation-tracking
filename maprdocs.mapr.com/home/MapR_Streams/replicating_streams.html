Stream Replication

   You can replicate streams to other MapR clusters worldwide or to other
   streams within a MapR cluster.

   There are many different scenarios in which replicating MapR-ES streams
   can be useful.

Basic Master-Slave Replication

   For example, suppose that your company has a factory in Nagoya, and
   sensors in the equipment track different metrics. The sensors are
   producers publishing messages to a stream named metrics. The
   applications that use the collected metrics would read the messages
   from the stream, playing the role of consumers. With replication, the
   factory could create a stream in the nagoya cluster and maintain a
   backup of the stream in the nagoya_ha cluster.

   This type of replication is called basic master-slave replication
   because replication is in one direction only. The metrics stream in the
   nagoya_ha cluster is considered to be a replica. The original metrics
   stream is considered to be the upstream source for the replica. This
   type of replication is simple to set up with the command maprcli stream
   replica autosetup.

   Suppose further that your company also has a factory in Kaesong which
   also collects metrics from its equipment, perform analyses on the data,
   and replicates its own metrics streams to a backup.

Many-to-One Replication

   Your company's headquarters are in San Francisco and you want data
   analysts there to be able to perform analyses of all data company-wide.
   You can replicate the two metrics streams that are in the your
   factories to the metrics stream in the sanfrancisco cluster. In this
   scenario, the replica is the metrics stream in the sanfrancisco
   cluster. This replica has two upstream sources: the metrics streams
   that are replicated from the two factories.

   This type of replication, called many-to-one replication, requires that
   the topics in each stream have unique names, so that message offsets do
   not conflict. For example, suppose both factories have an assembly line
   named Line 2 and the topic in each factory's stream for collecting
   metrics from this line is named line_2. At some point, the Nagoya
   factory and the Kaesong factory both replicate messages that use the
   same offsets. Because offsets are replicated together with messages,
   messages can be overwritten in this case.

   To avoid this type of problem, the sensors for Line 2 in the Nagoya
   factory might publish to a topic named line_2_nagoya, the sensors for
   Line 2 in the Kaesong factory might publish to a topic named
   line_2_kaesong, and so on. The consolidated stream in San Francisco
   would contain the topics line_2_nagoya and line_2_kaesong.

Multi-Master Replication

   Another type of of replication that can be useful is multi-master
   replication. You can use it when you need two streams both to send
   updates to and receive updates from the other stream. Each stream is a
   replica and an upstream source. MapR-ES keeps both streams synchronized
   with each other. This type of replication is also simple to set up with
   the command maprcli stream replica autosetup.

   As with many-to-one replication, the names of the topics in each stream
   must be unique across both streams, so that offsets for messages do not
   conflict.

   Updates are applied to replica streams by MapR gateways. See
   [1]Gateways and Stream Replication for more information.
