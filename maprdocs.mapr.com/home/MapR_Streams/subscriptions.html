Consumer Subscriptions

   Consumers subscribe to topics. When a consumer subscribes to a topic or
   partition, it means that the consumer wants to receive messages from
   that topic or partition. A subscription is the list of the topics,
   specific partitions, or both that a consumer is subscribed to.

   For example, an analytics application might subscribe to the topics
   rfids_productA, rfids_productB, and more to track movement of products
   from factories to distribution centers. A reporting tool might
   subscribe to the topics meters_NW, meters_SW, and more to get a report
   of electricity usage in different geographic regions that a power
   company services.
   Consumers can subscribe to:

   Topics
          When a consumer subscribes to a topic, it reads messages from
          all of the partitions that are in the topic. The exception is
          when a consumer is part of a consumer group. Consumer groups and
          this exception are explained in [1]Consumer Groups.

          Consumers can subscribe to topics in two ways:

        By name
                Consumers specify the names of the topics that they
                subscribe to.

        By regular expression
                Consumers specify a regular expression and subscribe to
                all topics with names that match the regular expression.

                The ability to use regular expressions is helpful when the
                -autocreate parameter for a stream is set to true and
                producers are allowed to create topics automatically at
                runtime.

                To unsubscribe from topics that you subscribed to with
                regular expressions, you must use the same regular
                expressions.

                For example, suppose that you use this regular expression
                to subscribe to topic0 and topic1:

topic[0-1]

                Next, you add topic2, topic3, and topic4 to the
                subscription, like this:

topic[0-4]

                Trying subsequently to unsubscribe from, say, topic0 has
                no effect. The consumer remains subscribed to it because
                topic0 was subscribed to as part of a regular expression.

                Trying to unsubscribe from topic[0-1] also has no effect
                because the regular expression topic[0-4] was used after
                topic[0-1], and the latter is a superset of the former.

                To unsubscribe from topic0, you would have to follow these
                steps:

              1. Unsubscribe from topic[0-4]. This step unsubscribes you
                 from topic2, topic3, and topic4. You must follow this
                 step because a) this regular expression was used last,
                 and b) because it is a superset of topic[0-1]. The order
                 in which regular expressions are used in subscriptions
                 matters. If you were to unsubscribe from topic[0-1]
                 first, you would still be subscribed to topic[0-4].
              2. Unsubscribe from topic[0-1]. This step unsubscribes you
                 from topic0 and topic1.

   Partitions
          Consumers can subscribe to individual partitions within topics.
          This is helpful in cases where you want a consumer to read the
          messages published to a specific partition. For example, a
          producer might publish messages for high-priority data to a
          specific partition for processing by a dedicated consumer.

          When a consumer subscribes to individual partitions within a
          topic, the consumer does not receive messages from any of the
          other partitions in the topic.

          Subscriptions to individual partitions can cause problems in
          consumer groups, as explained in the section [2]Consumer Groups.
