Log Visualization

   Use dashboards to visualize the logs across multiple nodes and
   clusters.

   [1]MapR's Community Exchange provides some sample dashboards that you
   can use to get started. The Community Exchange is also a good place to
   ask questions and share ideas.

   For information about creating and using dashboards, see the [2]Kibana
   documentation.
