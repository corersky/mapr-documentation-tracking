Allocating Memory for the OS, MapR-FS, and Hadoop Services

   The warden allocates memory to the operating system, MapR-FS, MapR
   Hadoop services based on the following parameters:
   Parameter Default     Description
     OS MapR-FS Hadoop Service(s)

   service.command.<os|mfs|servicename>.heapsize.percent

   varies
   varies Defines the heap size percentage.

   service.command. <os|mfs|servicename>.heapsize.max
   4000 85 5000 Defines the maximum heap size in MB.
   service.command. <os|mfs|servicename>.heapsize.min 256 512 256 Defines
   the minimum heap size in MB.

   The memory settings for the operating system and MapR-FS are configured
   in the warden.conf file. The warden.conf file is located in
   /opt/mapr/conf. Other services such as NodeManager and ResourceManager
   have their own warden.<servicename>.conf file within
   /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d. For more information about the warden files, see
   [1]warden.conf and [2]warden.<servicename>.conf.

   Note: Warden only allocates resources for MapR Hadoop services
   associated with roles that are installed on the node.
