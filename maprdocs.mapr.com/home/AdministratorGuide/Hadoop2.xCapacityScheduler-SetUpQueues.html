Setting Up Queues

   The ResourceManager uses the configuration file capacity-scheduler.xml,
   where you can configure various scheduling parameters related to
   queues. These parameters include:
     * the short queue name
     * the full queue path name
     * a list of associated child queues and applications
     * the guaranteed capacity (expressed as a percentage of slots in the
       cluster) available to the jobs in the queue
     * the maximum capacity of the queue
     * a list of active users and their resource allocation limits
     * the state of the queue (running or stopped)
     * access control lists that determine who can access the queue

   The CapacityScheduler has a pre-defined queue called root. All queues
   in the system are children of the root queue. Further queues can be set
   up by configuring yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.queues with a list of
   comma-separated child queues.
