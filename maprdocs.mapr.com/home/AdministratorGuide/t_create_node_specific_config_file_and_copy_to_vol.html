Step 2. Create a node-specific configuration file and copy it to a volume

   Complete the following steps to create a node-specific configuration
   file for host1 and copy it to the mapr.configuration volume:
    1. Edit the mapred-site.xml configuration file in /tmp (or you could
       copy the default version into /tmp again and edit that) and create
       the node-specific configuration file for host1.
    2. Create the directories required to store the file under
       /var/mapr/configuration/nodes:
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /var/mapr/configuration/nodes/host1/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/
hadoop
    3. Store the new configuration file for host1 in the node-specific
       directory you just created.
hadoop fs -put /tmp/mapred-site.xml /var/mapr/configuration/nodes/host1/hadoop/h
adoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop
