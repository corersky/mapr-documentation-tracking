Changing the Limit for Concurrent Mirror Operations Using the CLI

   The system allows a maximum of 50 concurrent mirroring operations by
   default. Mirroring operations include both mirroring and promoting from
   read-only mirrors to read-write standard volumes. The system parameter
   that controls this limit is mapr.mirror.concurrent.ops.

   For large-scale mirror operations involving many volumes, a script
   automates the process. For example, if a script queues 100 volumes for
   mirroring operations, and the mapr.mirror.concurrent.ops limit is set
   to 50, the mirroring operations start on the first 50 volumes in the
   queue. As soon as one volume completes, another volume is processed
   from the queue until all 100 are completed. Since volumes are processed
   from the queue in first-in first-out (FIFO) order, the script should
   specify the most critical volumes first.

   If you want to process more volumes at a time, you can raise the limit
   of the mapr.mirror.concurrent.ops parameter. To tune this parameter for
   maximum efficiency, consider the number of containers per volume. A
   higher number of containers per volume requires a lower limit than a
   lower number of containers per volume. To raise the limit to 500 for
   example, run the following command:
maprcli config save -values {"mapr.mirror.concurrent.ops":"500"}
