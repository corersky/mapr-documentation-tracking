Configuring MapR for HTTPS Upload to S3

   By default, MapR only trusts its own self-signed certificates. To
   configure MapR to trust the certificates used by AWS S3 for HTTPS
   upload, you must configure additional trusted certificates. Add one of
   the following to the /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore file on every node
   in the cluster:
     * The actual certificate used by the S3 endpoints you are using
     * A signer of the actual certificate used by the S3 endpoints you are
       using
     * A certificate higher in the trust chain that ultimately does sign
       the certificate for the S3 endpoint
       Note: Currently, the root certificate used by AWS S3 is the
       Baltimore CyberTrust root certificate provided by [1]Digicert.

   The following instructions are based on the assumption that you are
   adding the root certificate (known as the Baltimore CyberTrust root)
   provided by Digicert with a fingerprint of
   D4DE20D05E66FC53FE1A50882C78DB2852CAE474 and an expiration date of May
   12, 2025. You can also add other certificates to the truststore.
   Warning: Most Baltimore CyberTrust root certificates will expire in
   2025 and expired certificates cannot be used for connecting to S3. When
   Amazon replaces its certificates with those issued by new certificate
   authorities, you must update the truststore to hold both the old and
   new root certificates for a smooth transition.
    1. Download the Baltimore CyberTrust root certificate from the URL
       specified by Digicert, as in the following example:
# cd /tmp
# wget https://www.digicert.com/CACerts/BaltimoreCyberTrustRoot.crt
    2. Add the certificate to the MapR truststore.
         a. Go to the directory where the ssl_truststore file is located.
            For example:
# cd /opt/mapr/conf
         b. Run the command to add the certificate.
            For example:
# keytool -importcert -file /tmp/BaltimoreCybrTrustRoot.crt -keystore ssl_trusts
tore
         c. Enter the keystore password when prompted.
            The default is mapr123.
         d. Specify whether to trust this certificate by entering y when
            prompted.
            Note: The default value is [no].
            For example:
# cd /opt/mapr/conf
# keytool  -importcert -file /tmp/BaltimoreCyberTrustRoot.crt -keystore ssl_trus
tstore
Enter keystore password:
Owner: CN=Baltimore CyberTrust Root, OU=CyberTrust, O=Baltimore, C=IE
Issuer: CN=Baltimore CyberTrust Root, OU=CyberTrust, O=Baltimore, C=IE

Trust this certificate? [no]:  y
Certificate was added to keystore
            Wait for the message "Certificate was added to keystore"
            before proceeding.
         e. Copy the ssl_truststore file to all other MapR nodes in the
            same location (for example, /opt/mapr/conf/).
            Ensure that the correct truststore is available on all nodes
            because the service can be run on any node.
         f. Restart File Migration Service using MapR MCS or the maprcli
            command.
            See [2]Restarting the Service Using the Service UI for more
            information. The restart enables File Migration Service to use
            the newly added certificate.
