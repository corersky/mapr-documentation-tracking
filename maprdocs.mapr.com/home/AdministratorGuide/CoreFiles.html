Managing Core Files

   The Linux core_pattern file (in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern) can be
   used to specify the location for storing core files. If any process
   launched by MapR crashes, the core files are created in the directory
   specified by the core_pattern file. A valid location in the
   core_pattern file is a full path to the directory you want to use. For
   example:
/tmp/dir1/cores/%e.core.%p.%h

   Tip: For details about the standard Linux % specifiers that you can use
   to name core files, see the [1]core man page.

   If the core_pattern file is empty, if the file does not contain a full
   path, or if it uses the "|" redirection feature, by default, MapR sets
   the location for core files (in the event of a core dump on a node) to
   /opt/cores directory when:
     * The configure.sh utility is run.
     * The Warden init script is run.
     * The MFS init script is run by Warden.

   The default directory (/opt/cores) is also used if the core_pattern
   file contains the default MapR value for core files.

   For MapR software, the directory being used to store core files should
   not be used for other purposes and should be empty. The cores directory
   cannot be home directory because it can cause problems during SSH
   access. The hoststats service monitors the directory specified in the
   core_pattern file and raises the node-level [2]alarm if the directory
   contains any entry other than "." and "..". When Warden is started,
   sticky bit is set on the cores directory.
