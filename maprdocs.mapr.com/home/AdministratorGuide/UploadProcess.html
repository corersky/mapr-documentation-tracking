How the File Upload Process Works

   The File Migration service maintains in memory information regarding
   directories, subdirectories, and files within each directory tree to
   monitor. When started, the service first looks for changed and new
   files in the configured directories. To detect changes to existing
   files, the service looks at the extended attribute user.s3uploadtime,
   which is set on each file and contains the modification time (in
   milliseconds) when the file was last uploaded to the AWS S3 bucket. It
   then places the new and changed files in a queue for upload, sorted by
   the oldest modification timestamp. The service then uploads multiple
   files in parallel and provides logs as files upload, fail to upload, or
   complete uploading.
   Note: For each directory tree, you can set up any file or directory
   that matches a specified regex pattern to be ignored. For example, all
   files ending in .tmp or all files in /tmp directory can be set up to be
   ignored. Additionally, only files are considered for upload; empty
   directories, symbolic links, and tables or streams are ignored.

Scanning for New and Changed Files

   The service scans for new and changed files in the monitored
   directories using a full scan or a lite scan.
     * [1]Full Scan
     * [2]Lite Scan

   The service performs a full scan when it is first started and
   periodically or randomly for a subset of the directories in the
   directory tree after. This allows you to spread the cost of the full
   scan over time rather than performing a full scan of all directories at
   once.

   During a full scan, the service examines each file in a directory to
   determine if it has changed since the last time the directory was
   examined. If the file contains changes, then the file is examined more
   carefully.

   If the file was uploaded, the service retrieves the modification time
   of the file, which was set on the file at the time the file was
   uploaded. If the file was not uploaded or if the file was uploaded but
   the modification time changed since the last upload, the service places
   the file in the queue for upload.

   A full scan also discovers new directories and adds them to the list of
   directories to be monitored.
   The service performs an incremental scan to detect the last modified
   timestamp on each directory recursively using the in-memory directory
   tree from the last scan. If there is no change in the timestamp since
   the last scan, the service does not examine the directory contents and
   proceeds to the next directory; this makes the incremental scan very
   fast. If there is a change in the timestamp since the last scan, the
   service performs a full scan on the directory.
   Note: Before starting an incremental scan, the service checks to see if
   a directory tree is due for a full scan. Only a full scan allows the
   service to detect if a file was modified after upload. With a lite
   scan, the service checks only the modification time of the directory,
   which is not changed by the modification (such as due to late writes)
   of a file.

Queueing Files for Upload

   Files are placed in the queue with a configurable delay from the last
   known modification time of the file to avoid uploading a file that is
   still changing.

   For example, with the default of 15 seconds, a file that was modified 5
   seconds ago would remain on the queue for another 10 seconds, whereas a
   file modified 5 minutes ago would be immediately considered for upload.
   This allows files to be uploaded roughly in order by last modification
   time.

   The service places (by default, 10) files in the queue for parallel
   upload. The scanning service is paused if the pending queue exceeds 10
   times the number of files allowed for parallel update to avoid too many
   pending files.

Uploading Files to S3

   Uploads are in one of three states: waiting to be uploaded, uploading,
   finished with uploading. By default, the service performs a check on
   the status of the files being uploaded every 3 seconds and detects
   uploads that are approaching completion. The service then sets the
   extended attribute (user.s3uploadtime) to the file on MapR-FS to
   indicate that the file was uploaded.

   If an error occurs during upload, the file is requeued for another try
   after a brief wait, which is 5 minutes by default. If the file could
   not be uploaded after a specified number of attempts, the file is
   dequeued to allow other files to upload. Note that the file is
   rediscovered, if it is still there, during the next full scan and
   queued for upload.
   Note: When files are uploaded, although the file name remains the same,
   but the leading slash is removed and the full path is converted to a
   key on the AWS S3 bucket. For example, /tmp/foo after upload becomes
   the key tmp/foo on AWS S3 bucket.

Setting Extended Attributes

   When the upload completes, the service uses an extended attribute,
   user.s3uploadtime, to set the timestamp on the file to when the file
   was uploaded. This extended attribute, which contains the last upload
   timestamp, is used by the service to determine if a file has changed
   since the file was last uploaded.

Purging the Files and Directories

   The service also optionally deletes files after uploading and deletes
   empty directories. You can configure file deletion after upload in
   hours or fractions of an hour and configure empty directory deletion in
   minutes. Both can be set to zero, which disables the deletion function.
   Both functions are disabled by default.

   Deletion of files and directories happen only during a full scan:
     * [3]For files
     * [4]For directories

   For files, the modification timestamp on the file is examined to see
   how far back in time it was last modified.

   If the file has been uploaded in its present form and if it matches or
   exceeds the interval configured for file deletion, the file is
   immediately deleted. If it does not match the configured interval for
   file deletion, a message is printed (to the log file, filemigrate.log)
   as to when the file will be deleted if it will be deleted fairly soon.

   Files that were never uploaded (such as the files that were ignored)
   will not be deleted by the service.
   For directories, the contents of the directory and the modification
   timestamp on the directory are examined.

   If the directory is empty and the modification timestamp matches or
   exceeds the configured interval of time for directory deletion, the
   directory is deleted.

   The act of deleting a file or directory from a parent directory causes
   the modification timestamp of the parent directory to change.
   Therefore, an idle or empty (parent) directory is deleted only after
   the configured interval of time since the deletion of its children
   (file or subdirectory).

   The recursive deletion of directories has a slow bottom up behavior:
   first empty leaf directories are deleted and then the parents are
   deleted during a future full scan after the interval of time has
   elapsed.

   If a directory contains files that were never uploaded (ignored), the
   directory will not be deleted.
