Setting Up Node Topology

   Define your cluster's topology by specifying a topology for each node
   in the cluster. You can use topology to group nodes by rack or switch,
   depending on how the physical cluster is arranged and how you want MapR
   to place replicated data.

   Topology paths can be as simple or complex as needed to correspond to
   your cluster layout. In a simple cluster, each topology path might
   consist of the rack only (for example, /rack-1). In a deployment
   consisting of multiple large datacenters, each topology path can be
   much longer (for example,
   /europe/uk/london/datacenter2/room4/row22/rack5/). MapR uses topology
   paths to spread out replicated copies of data, placing each copy on a
   separate path. By setting each path to correspond to a physical rack,
   you can ensure that replicated data is distributed across racks to
   improve fault tolerance.
