Step 3. Verify the changes

   Now that you have two separate customized configuration files for your
   NodeManager nodes, the pullcentralconfig script will detect the new
   files in /var/mapr/configuration the next time it is launched. It
   overwrites the local version in /opt/mapr with the appropriate
   customized version for each of the five NodeManager nodes.
    1. To launch the pullcentralconfig script, perform one of the
       following operations:
          + Run pullcentralconfig from the command line to overwrite the
            old files immediately.
/opt/mapr/server/pullcentralconfig
          + Wait five minutes (the interval between successive checks for
            updated configuration files) for the script to run
            automatically.
    2. Look at the information messages in pullcentralconfig.log. Whenever
       the timestamp comparison is false, an INFO message indicates that
       the older file under /opt/mapr is copied into a backup file (.bkp)
       and the newer version is copied to replace it. Sample log output is
       shown here:
$ cat pullcentralconfig.log

ralConfig, processId: 16701

aprexecute.
    3. [1]Restart the service.
