Unmounting a Tenant Volume

   To unmount a tenant volume and:
     * Kill the FUSE process, run the following command:
service mapr-posix-client-* stop
       When you run the command, replace * with basic or platinum, which
       corresponds with the POSIX client package that is installed on the
       system.
       Note: For more information, see [1]Unmounting the FUSE Mount.
     * Stop the loopbacknfs service, run the following command:
service mapr-loopbacknfs stop
       Note: For more information, see [2]Managing the mapr-loopbacknfs
       Service
