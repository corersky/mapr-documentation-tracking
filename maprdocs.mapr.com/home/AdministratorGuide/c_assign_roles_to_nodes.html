Assigning Roles to Nodes for Best Performance

   The architecture of MapR software allows virtually any service to run
   on any node, or nodes, to provide a high-availability, high-performance
   cluster. Below are some guidelines to help plan your cluster's service
   layout.

Don't Overload the ZooKeeper

   High latency on a ZooKeeper node can lead to an increased incidence of
   ZooKeeper quorum failures. A ZooKeeper quorum failure occurs when the
   cluster finds too few copies of the ZooKeeper service running. If the
   ZooKeeper node is also running other services, competition for
   computing resources can lead to increased latency for that node. If
   your cluster experiences issues relating to ZooKeeper quorum failures,
   consider reducing or eliminating the number of other services running
   on the ZooKeeper node.

Separate High-Demand Services

   The following are guidelines about which services to separate on large
   clusters:
     * ResourceManager on ZooKeeper nodes: Avoid running the
       ResourceManager service on nodes that are running the ZooKeeper
       service. On large clusters, the ResourceManager service can consume
       significant resources.
