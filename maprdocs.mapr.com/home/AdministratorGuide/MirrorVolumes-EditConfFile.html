Setting Up Cross-Mirroring Between Unsecure Clusters

   To mirror volumes between unsecure clusters, start by editing the
   [1]mapr-clusters.conf file on the source volume's cluster and create an
   entry for each additional cluster that hosts a mirror of the volume.
   The entry must list the cluster's name, followed by a space-separated
   list of hostnames and ports for the cluster's CLDB nodes. In addition,
   use the secure parameter to specify whether the clusters are secure or
   non-secure. See [2]Configuring Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster
   Mirroring and Replication for more information about generating tickets
   for secure clusters.
   Note: When mirroring between clusters, servers in one cluster cannot
   use the same IP addresses as servers in the other cluster. For example,
   if node A in cluster A has a private IP address 10.10.20.29, no server
   in cluster B can have the same private IP address. Also, all the
   servers in one cluster must be able to reach all the servers in the
   other cluster and vice versa. For example, suppose 10.10.20.29 is the
   only IP address used by node A in cluster A; then all servers in
   cluster B should be able to reach the IP address 10.10.20.29.
   To set up cross-mirroring between unsecure clusters:
    1. Review the requirements for [3]Creating Remote Mirrors before you
       begin.
    2. On each cluster, make a note of the cluster name and CLDB nodes
       (the first line in [4]mapr-clusters.conf)
    3. On each webserver and CLDB node, add the remote cluster's CLDB
       nodes to /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf, using the following
       format:
clustername1  <CLDB> <CLDB> <CLDB>
[ clustername2  <CLDB> <CLDB> <CLDB> ]
[ ... ]
       For example, suppose you have a cluster, clusterA, with two CLDB
       nodes, nodeA and nodeB. Now you want to add a second cluster called
       clusterB with CLDB nodes nodeC and nodeD. Edit the
       mapr-clusters.conf file and add the line for clusterB as shown:
clusterA nodeA:7222 nodeB:7222
clusterV nodeC:7222 nodeD:7222
       Warning: You must include the port number in the CLDB hostname
       notation.
       Here:
         a. First line contains cluster name and CLDB nodes of cluster A
            (the local cluster)
         b. Second line contains cluster name and CLDB nodes of cluster B
            (the remote cluster)
       The mapr-clusters.conf file for cluster B with 2 CLDB nodes (nodeC
       and nodeD) would look like this:
clusterB nodeC:7222 nodeD:7222
clusterA nodeA:7222 nodeB:7222
       By creating additional entries in the mapr-clusters.conf file, you
       can mirror from one cluster to several others.
    4. Set secure=false if both clusters are not secure. If both the
       clusters are secure, see [5]Configuring Secure Clusters for
       Cross-Cluster Mirroring and Replication for more information.
       Warning: Mirroring only works between two secure clusters or
       between two non-secure clusters. Mirroring does not work when one
       cluster is secure and the other is non-secure.
    5. On each cluster, restart the mapr-apiserver service on all nodes
       where it is running.
