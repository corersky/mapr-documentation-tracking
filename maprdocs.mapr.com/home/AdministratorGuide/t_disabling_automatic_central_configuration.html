Disabling Automatic Central Configuration

    1. Automatic central configuration is enabled by default. You can
       configure central configuration to stop automatic runs of the
       pullcentralconfig script by editing warden.conf and setting the
       following variable to false: centralconfig.enabled=false
    2. To make the change take effect, restart Warden:
root$> service mapr-warden restart
       Note: When automatic central configuration is disabled, you can
       still manually run the pullcentralconfig script to push the latest
       configuration files to nodes in the cluster.
