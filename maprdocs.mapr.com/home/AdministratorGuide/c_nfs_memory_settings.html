Adjusting NFS Memory Settings

   The memory allocated to each MapR service is specified in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/warden.conf file, which MapR automatically configures
   based on the physical memory available on the node. You can adjust the
   minimum and maximum memory used for NFS, as well as the percentage of
   the heap that it tries to use, by setting the percent, max, and min
   parameters in the warden.conf file on each NFS node. Example:
...
service.command.nfs.heapsize.percent=3
service.command.nfs.heapsize.max=1000
service.command.nfs.heapsize.min=64
...

   The percentages need not add up to 100; in fact, you can use less than
   the full heap by setting the heapsize.percent parameters for all
   services to add up to less than 100% of the heap size. In general, you
   should not need to adjust the memory settings for individual services,
   unless you see specific memory-related problems occurring.
