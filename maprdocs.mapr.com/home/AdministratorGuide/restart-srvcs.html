Restarting the Services

   When a MapR system is rebooted, the following services are
   automatically restarted:
     * mapr-warden
     * mapr-zookeeper
     * mapr-loopbacknfs
     * mapr-posix-client-*

   These services are also automatically restarted if they are shut down
   externally (as opposed to being shut down explicitly via service or
   sysctl commands).
   Note: This feature is implemented with systemd and is only supported on
   the following operating systems:
     * RHEL 7.0, 7.1
     * CentOS 7.0, 7.1
     * SuSe 12

   This feature is not supported on any of the Ubuntu versions that MapR
   currently supports.

   You can restart one or more services using the MapR Control System and
   the CLI
