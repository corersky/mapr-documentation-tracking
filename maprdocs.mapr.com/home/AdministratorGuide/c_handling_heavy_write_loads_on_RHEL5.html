Handling Heavy Write Loads on RHEL5

   If you are operating on RHEL5 and have a heavy NFS write load, you
   might experience resource contention between the NFS client and the NFS
   server. This resource contention can cause the NFS server to be
   unresponsive. To avoid this potential problem, try one of these
   approaches:
     * Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and apply these settings on each NFS server:
vm.dirty_ratio=10
vm.dirty_background_ratio=5
       Reboot the server so the changes will take effect. To make the
       settings take effect immediately, issue the echo command as shown:
% echo 10 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
% echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio

     * Separate the NFS client from the NFS server so they do not compete
       for memory on the same system.
