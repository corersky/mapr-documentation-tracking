About the pullcentralconfig Script

   The pullcentralconfig script runs on each node in the cluster. The
   pullcentralconfig script is launched automatically at specified
   intervals (the default interval is 300 seconds, which is five minutes).
   For each service listed in /opt/mapr/roles, the pullcentralconfig
   script searches for corresponding configuration files in the central
   configuration location, /var/mapr/configuration. If any configuration
   files are found, it compares the timestamp (mtimes) of the files in the
   central configuration location to the timestamp of the local version in
   /opt/mapr. If the central configuration version is newer,
   pullcentralconfig overwrites the local version with the central
   configuration file. To ensure that the newer version gets used, you
   need to restart the associated service.
