Hadoop Commands

   You can set, retrieve, and remove extended attributes on files,
   directories, and FUSE mounted file path using the [1]hadoop fs command.
   When setting an extended attribute:
     * The name must be prefixed with a namespace.
     * The extended attribute value, there are three ways to encode the
       value:

   text The given string must be enclosed in double quotes to be treated
   as text.
   hex The given string must begin with 0x or 0X to be treated as
   hexadecimal number.
   base64 The given string must begin with 0s or 0S to be treated as
   base64 encoding.

   Note: You must have the right permissions to set, retrieve, and/or
   remove extended attributes.

Set Extended Attributes

   To set an extended attribute name and value for a file or directory,
   run the following command:
hadoop fs -setfattr -n name [-v value] <path>

   For example:
hadoop fs -setfattr -n user.key1 -v val1 /xattrs/m7user1/file1.txt

Retrieve Extended Attributes

   To retrieve the extended attributes associated with a file or
   directory, run the following command:
hadoop fs -getfattr [-R] -n name | -d [-e en] <path>

   For example:
hadoop fs -getfattr -d /xattr/m7user1/file1
# file: /xattr/m7user1/file1
user.key2="value2"
user.key1="value1"

Remove Extended Attributes

   To remove an extended attribute by name, run the following command:
hadoop fs -setfattr -x name <path>

   For example:
hadoop fs -setfattr -x user.key1 /xattrs/m7user1/dir1
