Enabling ZooKeeper Based State Store

   By default, the Resource Manager stores its state in the MapR-FS.
   However, you can use the Zookeeper based state store instead. To
   configure the ResourceManager to use the Zookeeper state store:
     * Set the value of yarn.resourcemanager.store.class to
       org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateSto
       re in the yarn-site.xml.
     * Set the value of yarn.resourcemanager.zk-address to a
       comma-separated list of host:port pairs for each ZooKeeper server
       used by the ResourceManager. This property needs to be set in
       yarn-site.xml.
