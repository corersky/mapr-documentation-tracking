FileMigrate.properties

   Properties Default Value Description
   UI Setting Property File
   Full Scan Frequency upload.fullScanFrequencyMin 60 Frequency, in
   minutes, at which full scan of all files detect changes missed by lite
   scans and purge (per the configured policy) uploaded files.
   Note: The actual time of a full scan is computed on a per directory
   basis and spread randomly around the specified fullScanFrequency. Thus
   specifying 60 minutes does not mean that all directories get a full
   scan at exactly 60 minutes. Instead, directories randomly get a full
   scan on average every 60 minutes (somewhere between 30 and 90 minutes).
   This approach avoids load spikes.
   Upload Scan Frequency upload.scanFrequencySec 60 Frequency, in seconds,
   at which light scans of directories detect changes since the last scan.
   This value cannot be below 10 seconds.
   Completion Scan Frequency upload.completionScanFrequencySec 3
   Frequency, in seconds, for checking upload status.

   This impacts the time delay before the queue is cleared for more
   uploads, the reporting time for completion, and statistics collection.
   Note: Values below the default may consume extra system resources.
   Minimum Wait Before Upload upload.minWaitBeforeUploadSecs 15 Length of
   time, in seconds, to wait for uploading a file since the file was last
   modified. Set a higher value to avoid uploading a file still being
   modified.
   Maximum Active Uploads upload.maxActiveUploads 10 Maximum number of
   files to upload concurrently. The scanning component of the file
   migration service is paused when 10 times this many files are waiting
   for upload.
   Minimum Wait After Failure upload.minWaitAfterFailureSecs 300 Amount of
   time, in seconds, to wait (pause) before retrying if upload fails or if
   there is an error in the file system.
   Maximum Retries Per File upload.maxErrorsOnOneFileBeforeGiveUp 10
   Maximum number of times to attempt to upload a file. If the limit is
   reached, the file is dequeued to allow other files to be uploaded and
   the file modification time does not change. The dequeued file is
   rediscovered and queued for upload during the next full scan.
   Maximum System Retries upload.maxErrorsBeforeAssumeSystemIssue 10
   Maximum number of errors to allow before pausing all uploads. If this
   limit is reached, uploads continue only after the amount of time
   specified as value for the minWaitAfterFailureSecs property has
   elapsed.
   Minimum Idle Time Before Error upload.minIdleTimeBeforeErrorSec 300
   Amount of time, in seconds, to wait before logging a warning (in the
   filemigrate.log file) if all uploads are not progressing.
   Bucket Location Region aws.region   Region information as defined here.
   For:
     * Older regions, specify the short region name.
     * New regions, specify the short region name and the region endpoint.

   The following regions can be specified using just the region name:
   us-east-1, us-west-1, us-west-2, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1,
   ap-southeast-2, sa-east-1, eu-west-1, cn-north-1, us-gov-west-1. For
   all other regions, you might have to specify the endpoint as well.
   Note: When you create a bucket in a region, verify that the bucket is
   really in that region; in some cases, buckets for one region are
   actually hosted elsewhere.
   Region Endpoint aws.regionendpoint   The AWS region endpoint.
   Proxy Host aws.proxyHost   (Optional) Proxy host information.
   Proxy Port aws.proxyPort
   Proxy Username aws.proxyUsername
   Proxy Password aws.proxyPassword
   Access Key aws.accessKey   Credentials to use for accessing the S3
   bucket.
   Secret Key aws.secretKey
   Directory Path dir<N>.path   The path from which the scan of the
   directory or root directory starts. Replace <N> with an integer; for
   each additional directory tree, increment the number and specify a
   unique path.
   Note: Do not create multiple policies or directory configurations
   pointing to the same file system location.
   Target Bucket dir<N>.bucket   The Amazon S3 bucket to upload to.
   Purge Interval dir<N>.purgepolicy.hours 0 Amount of time, in hours,
   after the file was last modified to wait before deleting the file. The
   default value is never delete (0).
   Note: Deletion is delayed until after the file upload occurs,
   regardless of the purge time set.
   Delete Empty Directories dir<N>.deleteEmptyDirectoryDelayMins 0 Amount
   of time to wait, in minutes, before deleting empty directories. The
   default value is never delete (0).
   Server Side Encryption dir<N>.serverSideEncrypt false Specify whether
   (true) or not (false) S3 server side encryption should be used. If the
   value is true (enabled), the TransferManager API that specifies AES256
   encryption is used automatically for each uploaded file.
   Ignore Files Regex dir<N>.ignoreFilesRegex   File and directory names
   to ignore, specified as regex pattern, as defined by java.util.regex.
   For example:
     * .*\.TEMP$ - ignore all files/directories ending in .TEMP
     * .*TEMP.* - ignore all files/directories that contain the phrase
       TEMP
     * ^TEMP.* - ignore all files/directories that start with TEMP

   Specify a single regular expression that matches multiple patterns, as
   shown in the following examples:
     * dir2.ignoreFilesRegex=^IGNORE.*|.*\.TMP$
     * dir2.ignoreFilesRegex=^IGNORE.*|.*\.TMP$|.*\\.TXT$|.*\\.txt$
     * dir2.ignoreFilesRegex=^temp$

   X-Attributes dir<N>.xattrs   The space-separated list of AWS S3
   attributes to copy from MFS to AWS S3 bucket when uploading a file.
   Make a note of the following:
     * While MFS attributes can be strings or binary, AWS S3 attributes
       must be strings.
     * While MFS attribute names are case sensitive, AWS S3 attribute
       names are case insensitive.

   Note: Only extended attributes from MapR-FS that start with user. are
   considered for upload (since all user settable attributes begin with
   user.). The attribute must be specified without user.. For example, to
   upload a file with the extended attribute name user.foo, the value for
   this property must be foo because the user. is implicit.
   Extended attributes are uploaded when the file is first uploaded. If
   extended attributes are set after file upload, the extended attributes
   are not sent to AWS S3 unless the file modification timestamp changes.
   Authorized Users authorized.users mapr The comma-separated list of
   users who can login and use the File Migration Service. The UI
   authorizes the following users to login and use the service:
     * The owner of the file migrate process (on the cluster, this is
       MAPR_USER).
     * Any users belonging to the comma-separated list of authorized users
       specified here.
     * Any users belonging to any group in the comma-separated list
       specified using authorized.groups property.

   The default value is the MAPR_USER (who is mapr, by default) specified
   with the [1]configure.sh utility.
   Authorized Groups authorized.groups mapr The comma-separated list of
   groups authorized to login and use the service. The default value is
   the MAPR_USER (mapr, by default) specified with the [2]configure.sh
   utility.
