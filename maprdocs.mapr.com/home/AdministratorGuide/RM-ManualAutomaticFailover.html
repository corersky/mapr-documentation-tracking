Manual or Automatic Failover for the ResourceManager

   With manual or automatic failover, an active ResourceManager and two
   standby ResourceManager processes run in the cluster. The standby
   ResourceManager nodes run the ResourceManager process without loading
   the working state. When the active ResourceManager fails, one of the
   standby ResourceManager nodes can load the working state from the
   ZooKeeper and continue providing services to the cluster.

   ResourceManager clients (MapR client nodes, ApplicationMaster
   processes, and NodeManager nodes) attempt connections to the
   ResourceManager nodes in a round-robin fashion until they hit an active
   ResourceManager node. If the active ResourceManager node is down,
   ResourceManager clients resume round-robin polling until an active
   ResourceManager node is detected.

   For web requests, including REST API requests, standby ResourceManager
   nodes automatically redirect web requests to the active ResourceManager
   node.

   The difference between manual and automatic failover is how the
   transition from standby to active occurs for the ResourceManager
   process.
     * With manual failover, you manually invoke the transition of the
       ResourceManager from standby to active with the [1]yarn rmadmin
       command.
     * With automatic failover, the ResourceManager processes have an
       embedded ZooKeeper-based ActiveStandbyElector, which chooses the
       active ResourceManager. This ActiveStandbyElector also detects
       failures in the currently active ResourceManager and automatically
       transitions one of the standby ResourceManagers to an active state.

   If you specify multiple ResourceManagers when you run configure.sh,
   automatic failover is configured. However, you can edit the
   yarn-site.xml to enable manual failover instead.
