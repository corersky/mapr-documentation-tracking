Setting a Hard Link

   To set a hard link using:
     * POSIX loopbacknfs client or NFS Gateway client, run the following
       command:
ln <sourcefile> <newfile>
       where <sourcefile> is the name of the file to link to and <newfile>
       is the name of the hard link, which must not already be present.
     * Hadoop, run the following command:
hadoop mfs -lnh <sourcefile> <newfile>
       where <sourcefile> is the name of the file (including full path) to
       link to and <newfile> is the name of the hard link (including the
       full path). When running this command, specify the full path to
       both files.
