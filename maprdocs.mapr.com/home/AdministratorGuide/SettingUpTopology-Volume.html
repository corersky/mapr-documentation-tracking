Setting Up Volume Toplogy

   After you define node topology for the nodes in your cluster, you can
   use volume topology to place volumes on specific racks, nodes, or
   groups of nodes.

   This sections describes the process of setting up:
     * Default volume topology
     * Local volume topology
     * Custom toplogy for local volume replicas
