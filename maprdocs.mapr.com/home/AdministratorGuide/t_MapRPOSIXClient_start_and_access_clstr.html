Starting the mapr-loopbacknfs Service to Access a Cluster

   The following instructions explain how to start the loopbacknfs service
   so you can access either a non-secure or secure cluster.
   Note: If you need to access multiple clusters, make sure the first
   cluster that you configure is a MapR 4.0.2 or later cluster, with
   available POSIX client licenses.

Prerequisites for accessing a secure cluster:

     * Enable security for the cluster. See [1]enabling and [2]disabling
       wire-level security.
     * Generate a user ticket. See [3]Generating a MapR User Ticket for
       instructions. If you do not already have a MapR user ticket, with
       full control ACL authorization on the cluster, you will have to
       have a cluster administrator do this for you.
          + Go to a server node in the MapR cluster to which you want to
            connect.
          + Be sure to run maprlogin password to log in first. The user
            that logs in must be a privileged user, such as the mapr
            superuser.
          + Then run maprlogin generateticket -type service -user <user>
            -duration 365:0:0 -out <file> to generate the user ticket. The
            <user> for whom the ticket is generated can be any user. If
            the service ticket expires, the POSIX client will:
               o Automatically use the renewed service ticket without
                 requiring a restart if the ticket is replaced before
                 expiration (ticket expiry time + grace period of 55
                 minutes). If the ticket is replaced after expiration
                 (which is ticket expiry time + grace period of 55
                 minutes), the POSIX loopbacknfs client will not refresh
                 the ticket as the mount will become stale.
               o Allow impersonation if a service ticket is replaced
                 before ticket expiration (which is ticket expiry time +
                 grace period of 55 minutes) with a
                 servicewithimpersonation ticket.
               o Honor all changes in user/group IDs of the renewed
                 ticket.
     * Copy the user ticket file from the cluster server node where you
       generated it to the /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/conf directory on
       the client machine where the MapR POSIX client will run.

   Note: Since the NFS server runs based on a single user's ticket, it can
   act on behalf of only one user. Therefore, the UID or GID associated
   with the ticket must match the UID or GID of any user who accesses the
   NFS server via MapR POSIX Client.
   Note: Securing the cluster so that only one user can have secure access
   provides tight control over cluster access, but it also means that any
   user on the client who is able to read the generated ticket will have
   read access to all data in the cluster.

Start the mapr-loopbacknfs service and mount the volume

   Complete the following steps from your client node, except where noted,
   to start the mapr-loopbacknfs service and mount the volume:
   Note: If cluster security is enabled, the ticket you generated above
   must be available or the NFS server will not start.
    1. Start the mapr-loopbacknfs service from the command line.
# service mapr-loopbacknfs start
    2. Create a mount point at /mapr and mount the client node to it.
                     # mkdir /mapr
                     # mount localhost:/mapr /mapr
    3. You can also automate the mounting of the volume with every launch
       of the mapr-loopbacknfs service. On the POSIX client node, create
       /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/conf/mapr_fstab and add the following
       line:
localhost:/mapr /mapr hard,nolock
