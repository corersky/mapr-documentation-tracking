Automatic Failover Administration

   The Zookeeper-based ActiveStandbyElector on each ResourceManager node
   detects failures in the currently active ResourceManager and
   automatically transitions one of the standby ResourceManagers to an
   active state. Therefore, rmadmin -transitionToStandby and
   -transitionToActive are disabled.
