Queue Access Control Lists

   Queue Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow administrators to control who
   may take actions on particular queues. They are configured with the
   following properties:
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.support.acl_submit_applications
yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.support.acl_administer_queue

   These properties can be set per queue. Currently the only supported
   administrative action is killing an application. Anyone who has
   permission to administer a queue may also submit applications to it.
   These properties take values in a format like user1,user2 group1,group2
   or group1,group2. An action on a queue will be permitted if its user or
   group is in the ACL of that queue or in the ACL of any of that queue's
   ancestors. So if queue2 is inside queue1, and user1 is in queue1's ACL,
   and user2 is in queue2's ACL, then both users may submit to queue2.

   The root queue's ACLs are "*" by default which, because ACLs are passed
   down, means that everyone may submit to and kill applications from
   every queue. To restrict access, change the root queue's ACLs to
   something other than "*".

   By default, the yarn.admin.acl property in yarn-site.xml is also set to
   "*", which means any user can be the administrator. If queue ACLs are
   enabled, you also need to set the yarn.admin.acl property to the
   correct admin user for the YARN cluster. For example:
<property>
<name>yarn.admin.acl</name> >
<value>mapr</value> >
</property>

   If you do not set this property correctly, users will be able to kill
   YARN jobs even when they do not have access to the queues for those
   jobs.
