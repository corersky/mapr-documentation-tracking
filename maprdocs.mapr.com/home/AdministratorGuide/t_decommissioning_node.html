Decommissioning a Node and Uninstalling MapR Software from the Command-line

   Use the following procedure to remove a node and uninstall the MapR
   software. This procedure detaches the node from the cluster and removes
   the MapR packages, log files, and configuration files, but does not
   format the disks.
   Note: Before Decommissioning a Node, make sure any data on the node is
   replicated and any needed services are running elsewhere. If the node
   you are decommissioning runs a critical service such as CLDB or
   ZooKeeper, verify that enough instances of that service are running on
   other nodes in the cluster. See [1]Planning the Cluster for
   recommendations on service assignment to nodes.

   Complete the following steps to permanently decommission a node:
    1. Drain the node of data by moving the node to the /decommissioned
       physical topology. All the data on a node in the /decommissioned
       topology is migrated to volumes and nodes in the data topology.
    2. Run the following command to check if a given volume is present on
       the node:
maprcli dump volumenodes -volumename <volume> -json | grep <ip:port>
       Note: Run this command for each non-local volume in your cluster to
       verify that the node being decommissioned is not storing any volume
       data.
    3. Change to the root user (or use sudo for the following commands).
    4. Stop Warden on the node by running the following command:
service mapr-warden stop
    5. If ZooKeeper is installed on the node, stop it: service
       mapr-zookeeper stop
    6. Determine which MapR packages are installed on the node:
          + dpkg --list | grep mapr (Ubuntu)
          + rpm -qa | grep mapr (Red Hat or CentOS)
    7. Remove the packages by issuing the appropriate command for the
       operating system, followed by the list of services. Examples:
          + apt-get purge mapr-core mapr-cldb mapr-fileserver (Ubuntu)
          + yum erase mapr-core mapr-cldb mapr-fileserver (Red Hat or
            CentOS)
    8. Remove the /opt/mapr directory to remove any instances of hostid,
       hostname, zkdata, and zookeeper left behind by the package manager.
    9. Remove any MapR cores in the /opt/cores directory.
   10. If the node you have decommissioned is a CLDB node or a ZooKeeper
       node, then run configure.sh on all other nodes in the cluster. See
       [2]Configuring the Node.
   11. Remove the node by running the following command:
maprcli node remove <node hostname|ip>
