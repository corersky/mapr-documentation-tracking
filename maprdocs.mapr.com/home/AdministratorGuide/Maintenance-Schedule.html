   perform daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly, as well as initial setup
   tasks. This sample schedule is offered as a template that you can
   customize to suit your needs.

   Clean up logs Audit storage use
   Check Prerequisites Onboard new users Check for zombie jobs Reevaluate

   Verify Installation Offboard users Perform simple performance test
   Check performance (jobs, I/O) Upgrade MapR core, Hive, HCatalog
   High Availability planning Check cluster health Verify snapshots Verify
   mirrors
