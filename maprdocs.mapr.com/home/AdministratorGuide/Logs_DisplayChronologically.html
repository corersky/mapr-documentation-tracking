Display Logs Chronologically

   To display logs chronologically in Kibana, sort the log events by the
   event_time column.

   @timestamp indicates the time with second precision and is not as
   precise as event_time which indicates the time with millisecond
   precision. Therefore, if you want to display logs chronologically in
   Kibana, sort the log events by the event_time column, not the
   @timestamp column.
