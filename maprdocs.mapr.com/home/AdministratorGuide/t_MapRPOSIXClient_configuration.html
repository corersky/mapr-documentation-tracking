Configuring the MapR POSIX Client

   The default RPC requests configuration can negatively impact
   performance and memory. To avoid performance and memory issues,
   configure the number of outstanding RPC requests to the cluster to be
   128.

   Perform the following steps as the root user on each POSIX client
   machine:
    1. Issue the following commands to create the sunrpc.conf file under
       /etc/modprobe.d with the recommended configuration:
echo "options sunrpc tcp_slot_table_entries=128" >> /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf
echo "options sunrpc tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128" >> /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.c
onf
       This will enable the configuration to persist after a reboot of the
       NFS client machine.
    2. Issue the following echo commands:
echo 128 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_slot_table_entries
echo 128 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_max_slot_table_entries
       This will enable the configuration to take effect after you remount
       the POSIX client to the MapR cluster.
    3. Remount the POSIX client to the Mapr cluster. For example, the
       following commands unmount and mount the NFS assuming that the
       cluster is mounted at /mapr:
# umount /mapr
# mount -o hard,nolock 127.0.0.1:/mapr /mapr
       Note: Failure to configure this property may result in the
       following error in /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/log: ERROR
       nfsserver[38960] fs/nfsd/requesthandle.cc:791 0.0.0.0[0] cannot
       allocate more OncRpcContexts: [numDropped=2556001] dropping
       connection from nfsc=10.13.64.225:0
       CentOS Troubleshooting Tip
       After the reboot of the node, if the /proc/sys/sunrpc directory not
       available or if rpcidmapd is not running, start the rpcidmapd
       service using the following command: service rpcidmapd start
