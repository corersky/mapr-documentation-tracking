Scheduling Queues

   The scheduler organizes applications further into queues, and shares
   resources fairly between these queues. By default, all users share a
   single queue, named default. If an application specifically lists a
   queue in a container resource request, the request is submitted to that
   queue. You can also assign queues based on the user name included with
   the request through configuration. Within each queue, a scheduling
   policy is used to share resources between the running applications. The
   default is memory-based fair sharing, but FIFO and multi-resource with
   Dominant Resource Fairness can also be configured.

   Queues can be arranged in a hierarchy to divide resources, and they can
   be configured with weights to share the cluster in specific
   proportions. The Fair Scheduler uses a concept called a queue path to
   configure a hierarchy of queues. The queue path is the full path of the
   queue's hierarchy, starting at root. The following example has three
   top-level child-queues a, b, and c and some sub-queues for a and b:

   In addition to providing fair sharing, the Fair Scheduler allows
   assigning guaranteed minimum shares to queues, which is useful for
   ensuring that certain users, groups or production applications always
   get sufficient resources. When a queue contains apps, it gets at least
   its minimum share, but when the queue does not need its full guaranteed
   share, the excess is split between other running apps. This lets the
   scheduler guarantee capacity for queues while utilizing resources
   efficiently when these queues do not contain applications.
