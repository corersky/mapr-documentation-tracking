Removing a Service from an Existing Node

    1. Stop the service you want to remove by using the MapR Control
       System (MCS) or the maprcli command-line tool. The following
       example stops the Fileserver service:
% maprcli node services -fileserver stop -nodes mapr-node1
    2. Purge the service packages with the apt-get, yum, or zypper
       commands, as suitable for your operating system.
    3. Run the [1]configure.sh script with the -R option.
    4. When you remove the CLDB or ZooKeeper role from a node, run
       configure.sh -R on all nodes in the cluster.
