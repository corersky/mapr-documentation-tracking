Label-based Scheduling

   Label-based scheduling provides a way to allocate shared cluster
   resources on particular nodes in a cluster. First, you assign node
   labels in a text file. The node labels map to one or more nodes. Next,
   you can create queue labels and job labels based on the node labels.
   When you run jobs, you can place them on specified nodes on a per-job
   basis (using a job label) or at the queue level (using a queue label).
   This feature is used in conjunction with schedulers, such as the Fair
   Scheduler or the Capacity Scheduler.
   Note: Do not use preemption when FairScheduler DominantResourceFairness
   is in use and node labels are present.

   scheduling:
