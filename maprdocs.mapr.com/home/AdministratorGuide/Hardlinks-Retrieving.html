Retrieving the Number of Hard Links

   To retrieve the number of hard links associated with a file, run the
   following command:
ls -l

   The command, ls -l, will print the number of hardlinks in the second
   column. For example, your output will look similar to the following:
[root@atsqa6c51 vol1]# ls -l sample-link
rw-r--r- 2 root root 0 Apr 21 11:09 sample-link

   To retrieve the list of the hard links associated with a file, run the
   following command:
find <dirpath> -samefile <sourcefile>

   where <dirpath> is the path to the source file and <sourcefile> is the
   source file for the hard link. For example, your output will look
   similar to the following:
[root@atsqa6c51 vol1]# find . -samefile file8
./file8-link2
./file8-link100
./file8-link101
./file8
./file8-link

   For POSIX (loopback NFS) clients, the number of hardlinks to a file can
   be retrieved using the stat64 system call. For example, your output
   will look similar to the following:
[root@atsqa6c51 cluster2]# stat samplefile
File: 'samplefile'
Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 131072 regular empty file

   If you are not using NFS or the POSIX clients, to retrieve the number
   of hard links, you can run the hadoop command to retrieve the fid and
   then run the maprcli command to retrieve the number of hard links as
   shown below. The nlink variable will print the number of links.
# hadoop mfs -ls /p1
