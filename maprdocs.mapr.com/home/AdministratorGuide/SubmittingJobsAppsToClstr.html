Submitting Jobs and Applications to the Cluster

   You can submit YARN applications (MapReduce version 2 and other
   applications that run on YARN) to the same cluster. An application can
   be submitted to the cluster in the following ways:
     * The hadoop jar command submits an MRv2 application.
     * The yarn jar command submits an application.
     * An external application submits an application.
     * An ecosystem component generates and submits an application.
     * The hadoop job command submits an MRv2 application.
     * The mapred job command submits an MRv2 application.

   When you submit a non-MapReduce application to the cluster, such a
   Spark application, it is automatically processed using yarn mode
   (ResourceManager, NodeManager, and MapReduce ApplicationMaster).
   Note: The method to submit Hadoop commands from a Windows or Mac client
   is different, For details, see [1]Setting Up the Client.
