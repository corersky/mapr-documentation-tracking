Log Aggregation and Storage

   Fluentd uses a round-robin approach when writing logs to Elasticsearch
   nodes. In the event that an Elasticsearch node in unavailable, Fluentd
   can fail over log storage to another Elasticsearch node.

   Each Fluentd service connects to each Elasticsearch node that you
   configure to aggregate and store logs. The Elasticsearch nodes are set
   when you configure MapR Monitoring with the MapR installer or when you
   run [1]configure.sh with the -ES parameter.

   The Elasticsearch index directory is shared among all the Elasticsearch
   nodes in the cluster. When you use the MapR Installer to install
   Elasticsearch, each Elasticsearch node writes index data to
   /opt/mapr/es_db, unless you specified a different location during the
   installation. When you manually install Elasticsearch, each
   Elasticsearch node writes index data to
   /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/var/lib/MaprMonitoring/
   , unless you specified a different location using the configure.sh
   -ESDB option. For a cluster with one Elasticsearch node, the index
   directory is allocated 5 shards. For clusters with 2 or more
   Elasticsearch nodes, the index directory is allocated a number of
   shards equal to 3 times the number of Elasticsearch nodes in the
   cluster.

   Fluentd does not require additional configuration to enable automatic
   failover to an available Elasticsearch node. However, it is important
   that at least three Elasticsearch nodes are configured to aggregate and
   store logs so that failure of one node does not prevent logs from being
   used for monitoring purposes. Based on your environment, more
   Elasticsearch nodes may be required. [2]Service Layout Guidelines for
   Large Clusters.
