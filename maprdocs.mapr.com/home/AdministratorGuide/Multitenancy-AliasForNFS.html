Setting Up Aliases for NFS Exports

   When provisioning MFS for various tenants, you can set up an alias for
   the path in MFS, rather than exporting the whole path, to mask the path
   from the users. Once the alias is set up, users will not be able to
   access or mount the path in MFS.

   Aliases can be set up for the cluster, volume, and directory, but not
   for the root of the path in MFS (/mapr). To set up an alias for a path
   in MFS:
    1. Open the NFS exports file in /opt/mapr/conf/ directory.
    2. Specify the alias name for the mount path using the following
       syntax:
<path in MFS> /<alias name> <options>
       Here:

   <path in MFS> Refers to the MFS mount path. If this points to a:
          + Volume, the user can access the snapshots associated with the
            volume.
          + Directory, the user cannot access the snapshots.

   /<alias name> Refers to the alias name to use. If there are duplicate
   aliases in the file, the last entry will take effect and all other
   duplicate entries will be ignored. If the alias name is not specified,
   the path in MFS will be exported.
   <options> The list of available/supported options.
       For example, suppose a MFS mount path of
       /mapr/samplecluster/samplevolume for tenant samplecustomer. To set
       up an alias, add the following to the exports file:
/mapr/samplecluster/samplevolume /samplecustomer (rw)
       For example, to export a certain cluster, volume, or a subdirectory
       as an alias, comment out /mapr and add the following:
/mapr/clustername /alias1 (rw)
/mapr/clustername/vol /alias2 (rw)
/mapr/clustername/vol/dir /alias3 (rw)
       Note: Only the alias will be visible/exposed to the NFS client.
    3. Run the following command for the file changes to take effect:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli nfsmgmt refreshexports
    4. Run the following command to export the path:
mount -t nfs nfsServer:/<alias_name> /localpath
       Run this command once for each entry in the file.

   The same export rules must be set up on all the NFS servers in the
   cluster to ensure that in the event of a node failure, the same aliases
   work with VIP failover.
