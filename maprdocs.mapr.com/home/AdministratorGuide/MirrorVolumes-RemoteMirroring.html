Remote Mirroring

   A remote mirror volume is a mirror volume with a source in another
   cluster. You can use remote mirrors for offsite backup, for data
   transfer to remote facilities, and for load and latency balancing for
   large websites. By mirroring the cluster's root volume and all other
   volumes in the cluster, you can create an entire mirrored cluster that
   keeps in sync with the source cluster.

   Backup mirrors for disaster recovery can be located on physical media
   outside the cluster or in a remote cluster. In the event of a disaster
   affecting the source cluster, you can check the time of last successful
   synchronization to determine how current the backup is (see [1]Mirror
   Status).

   Once data volumes are created in a primary datacenter, the MapR
   administrator creates mirror volumes in a remote secondary datacenter.
   The following diagram illustrates the mirror relationship between these
   two volumes:

   Note: When you use promotable mirrors, the volumes on the destination
   cluster must be set up in the same way as on the primary site. This
   means that volume names are the same and mount points are the same. If
   a hierarchical mounting structure (such as /A/B) is used on the primary
   site, the same structure must be recreated once mirror volumes are
   promoted at the secondary site.
