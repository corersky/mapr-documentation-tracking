CLDB Failover

   The CLDB service automatically replicates its data to other nodes in
   the cluster, preserving at least two (and generally three) copies of
   the CLDB data. If the CLDB process dies, it is automatically restarted
   on the node. All jobs and processes wait for the CLDB to return, and
   resume from where they left off, with no data or job loss.

   If the node itself fails, the CLDB data is still safe, and the cluster
   can continue normally as soon as the CLDB is started on another node.
   In an Enterprise Edition-licensed cluster, a failed CLDB node
   automatically fails over to another CLDB node without user intervention
   and without data loss. It is possible to recover from a failed CLDB
   node on a Community Edition cluster, but the procedure is somewhat
   different.

   Complete the following steps to recover from a failed CLDB node on a
   community edition cluster:
