Replication Role Balancer

   The replication role balancer manages containers to optimize the
   following:
     * Network bandwidth during the replication process
     * Disk I/O and CPU when serving read requests

   The replication role balancer switches the replication roles of name
   and data containers to balance them across each storage pool in a
   volume. You can modify the cldb.role.balancer.strategy parameter from
   the maprcli to change how the role balancer manages the containers,
   either by size or count. You can also run the dump rolebalancerinfo
   command to see the status of active role switches or how container
   roles are balanced across each storage pool for a particular volume.

Replicated Containers

   The name container is the first container created in every volume. Name
   containers can have either a master or a replica role. Data containers
   can have a master, intermediate, or tail role. By default, each name
   and data container is replicated across the cluster three times, with
   the master being the first container written. The master is
   sequentially replicated two more times, into a container with either an
   intermediate or a tail container role. If too many master or
   intermediate containers exist on a storage pool or if the master and
   intermediate containers are too large, the role balancer switches some
   of these containers to tail containers.

   By default, the role balancer compares the size of the master and tail
   containers to determine if containers within a storage pool are
   balanced. For the best performance, the size of the master containers
   in a volume should be evenly distributed across storage pools. The role
   balancer maintains this balance by ensuring that each type of container
   (master, intermediate, and tail) accounts for 1/ReplicationFactor of
   the total container size in a volume.

   If the role balancer is configured to manage containers by count, it
   compares the number of master and tail containers and balances the
   roles such that each type of container accounts for 1/ReplicationFactor
   of the total number of containers in a volume. For example, if the
   replication factor is set to 3, the role balancer maintains a balance
   of ⅓ master, ⅓ intermediate, and ⅓ tail containers in each volume.

MapR-DB Considerations

   To optimize MapR-DB performance, you should configure the role balancer
   to manage containers by size. As described at [1]MapR-DB and MapR-FS,
   MapR-DB shards tables into tablets and stores the tablets in data
   containers. Only master data containers serve reads. So, configuring
   the role balancer by size spreads read requests evenly across the
   storage pools for a volume. To ensure the most optimal balancing for
   your MapR-DB tables, you should consider storing them on dedicated
   volumes.

Assign Cache

   The assign cache is a list of reserved containers on a particular
   fileserver node that are allocated by the CLDB (container location
   database). The replication role balancer does not balance the
   containers in the assign cache and does not include them when balancing
   the roles. See the [2]maprcli dump rolebalancerinfo command for assign
   cache values and details.
