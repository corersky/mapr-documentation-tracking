Multitenancy on MFS

   Multitenancy architecture enables a single instance of a software to be
   provisioned for multiple customers or users, who are referred to as
   tenants. Each tenant, or group of users, has a specific share of the
   instance including access to its data, configuration, and access
   management. On the cloud, this enables a software-as-a-service (SaaS)
   provider to provision the software for multiple tenants.

   The MapR-FS multitenancy architecture enables you to create and
   restrict a MapR volume (referred to as a share) to a subset of client
   nodes. By doing this, you can isolate users or hosts (referred to as
   tenants). Isolation enables you to set policies, quotas, and access
   privileges for specific tenants. You can provision MapR File System on
   the cloud to various tenants, with each tenant owning its own copy of
   storage space, users, data security, administration, and so on.

   In a multitenant environment, tenants operate in their own provisioned
   spaces, unaware of other tenants on the cluster. Tenants have exclusive
   access to data in their environment only.

   For example, the following diagram depicts cluster provisioned on the
   cloud for two tenants, Tenant1 and Tenant2. The cluster has two
   separate volumes, mounted at directories /cloud/tenant1 and
   /cloud/tenant2. Each tenant volume contains file data created and
   managed by tenant users on the tenant host. Each of these tenants maps
   to a different volume and so, data in each volume can have different
   policies, disk-usage quotas, snapshot and mirroring schedules, and so
   on. By using appropriate tenant tickets, access to data in these
   volumes is restricted to users on the appropriate tenant hosts only,
   thus eliminating the possibility of a user from Tenant2 accessing data
   on the Tenant1 volume, and vice versa.

   Tenant shares can be accessed using loopbacknfs and FUSE-based POSIX
   clients only. After the tenant volume is mounted for access using
   (FUSE-based and loopbacknfs) POSIX clients, operations can be performed
   using standard Linux commands.
