Zero Configuration Failover for the ResourceManager

   As of MapR 4.0.2, you can use zero configuration failover. With zero
   configuration failover, the ResourceManager role is installed on two or
   more nodes but the ResourceManager process only runs on one node in the
   cluster.

   If the node running the ResourceManager process fails and the Warden on
   that node is unable to restart it, the Warden on each node and
   Zookeeper work together to start a ResourceManager process on the
   cluster. ResourceManager clients connect to the Zookeeper to determine
   which ResourceManager node is active. Therefore, when failover occurs,
   the Resource Manager clients are not affected as they automatically
   connect to the active ResourceManager.
   Note: When you run maprcli service list command, the state of the
   active ResourceManager process displays as 2 (running) but the other
   ResourceManagers displays as 5 (stand by).
