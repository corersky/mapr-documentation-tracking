Configuring the File Migration Service Using the Properties File

   To configure the File Migration Service:
    1. Stop the service (if it is currently running).
       See [1]Starting, Stopping, and Restarting the Service Using the CLI
       for more information.
    2. Make a copy of the
       /opt/mapr/filemigrate/filemigrate-1.0.0/conf/FileMigrate.properties
       .default and rename the file to FileMigrate.properties if you have
       not yet set any properties and wish to start from the defaults, as
       in the following example.
cp /opt/mapr/filemigrate/filemigrate-1.0.0/conf/FileMigrate.properties.default F
ileMigrate.properties
       Alternatively, you can use
       maprfs:///var/mapr/filemigrate/FileMigrate.properties file if you
       have already used the UI to set some properties and want to perform
       further edits manually. See [2]Managing Policies for more
       information.
    3. Edit the FileMigrate.properties file to change the settings for the
       service, if/where necessary, and save the file.
       For more information, see [3]FileMigrate.properties.
    4. Copy the FileMigrate.properties file to /var/mapr/filemigrate/
       directory, as in the following example.
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /tmp/FileMigrate.properties /var/mapr/filemigrate
       Note: If the directory does not already exist, create it by running
       the hadoop fs -mkdir command. The FileMigrate.properties file
       contains sensitive information and the recommendation is to limit
       read access to the directory. If the service creates the directory,
       by default, only the MAPR_USER and MAPR_GROUP have read access to
       the directory.
    5. Restart the service using the maprcli command, as in the following
       example.
maprcli node services -name filemigrate -nodes <node to restart> -action restart
