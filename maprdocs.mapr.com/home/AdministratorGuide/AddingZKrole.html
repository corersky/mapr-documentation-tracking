Adding a ZooKeeper Role

   If you are increasing the number of ZooKeeper roles in the cluster, for
   example from one to three, shut down the cluster before you add the
   role to the nodes to prevent any problems and then start the cluster
   upon completion.

   Complete the following steps to add the ZooKeeper role to a node:
    1. Install the ZooKeeper package corresponding to the new role.
    2. Run configure.sh -Z on the node where you added the new ZooKeeper
       role.
       Using the -Z option provides the list of ZooKeeper nodes that
       includes the new node.
    3. Run configure.sh -Z on all other nodes in the cluster.
       Using the -Z option to provide the list of ZooKeeper nodes that
       includes the new node.
    4. Issue the following command to start or restart ZooKeeper on the
       node where you added the ZooKeeper role:
% service mapr-zookeeper restart
    5. Perform a rolling restart of ZooKeeper on all other ZooKeeper
       nodes.
       A rolling restart of ZooKeeper means restart ZooKeeper on each
       node, one at a time, pausing until the last restart finishes before
       beginning the next. Restart the ZooKeeper leader last.
    6. Issue the following command to verify that the new node joined the
       ZooKeeper quorum:
% service mapr-zookeeper qstatus
    7. Perform a rolling restart of Warden on all other nodes.
       Warden picks up the new ZooKeeper node. Issue the following command
       to restart Warden on the node where you installed the role:
% service mapr-warden restart
