Using Promotable Mirrors for Disaster Recovery

   The concept of promoting a mirror refers to the ability to make a
   read-only mirror volume into a read-write volume. The main use case for
   this feature is to support disaster-recovery scenarios in which a
   read-only mirror needs to be promoted to a read-write volume so that it
   can become the primary volume for data storage.
   A MapR administrator can perform the following tasks from a remote
   datacenter before, during, and after a disaster:
     * Set up mirroring to a remote cluster
     * Fail over to a mirror volume
     * Restore the mirror relationship

   For a brief overview of the terminology used to describe volume types,
   along with some basic commands, see the [1]Types of Volumes.

   mirrors for disaster recovery:
