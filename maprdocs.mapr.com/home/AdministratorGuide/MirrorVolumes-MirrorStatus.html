Viewing Mirror Status

   You can see a list of all mirror volumes and their current status in
   the Mirror Volumes view (in the MapR Control System, select Mirror
   Volumes from the dropdown menu in the Volumes pane under Data >
   Volumes) or using the [1]volume list command. Completion time for a
   mirroring operation is affected by available network bandwidth and the
   amount of data to transmit. For best performance, set the mirroring
   schedule according to the anticipated rate of data changes and the
   available bandwidth for mirroring.
