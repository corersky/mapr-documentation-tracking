Handling Mount Points in Promoted Mirror Volumes

   After you promote read-only mirror volumes to read-write standard
   volumes, you must re-establish the mount points that were set up in the
   source cluster. To understand the steps in this process, consider the
   following scenario:

   A source cluster has volumes A, B, and C, which are mounted at /A,
   /A/B, and /A/B/C respectively. Each source volume is mirrored to a
   volume in another cluster (the destination cluster). The names of the
   corresponding mirror volumes are also A, B, and C.
   Note: When you use promotable mirrors, the volumes on the destination
   cluster must be set up in the same way as on the primary site. This
   means that volume names are the same and mount points are the same. If
   a hierarchical mounting structure (such as /A/B) is used on the primary
   site, the same structure must be recreated once mirror volumes are
   promoted at the secondary site.

   Mirror volume A is mounted at /A, but since the mirror is read-only, no
   mount point can be created beneath it for mirror B or mirror C.

   Warning: Mirror volumes that are promoted to standard (read-write)
   volumes are not available for write operations until they are mounted
   explicitly.

   Now suppose that all three mirror volumes are promoted to read-write
   volumes. Before any data can be written to these volumes, the volume
   links must be removed and the volumes must be remounted. The commands
   for each step are shown below.
    1. Promote A, B, and C to read-write volumes.
Cluster2> maprcli volume modify -name A -type rw
Cluster2> maprcli volume modify -name B -type rw
Cluster2> maprcli volume modify -name C -type rw
       To promote using MCS, see [1]Changing Mirror Volumes to Standard
       Volumes.
    2. Remove the vol links located at /A/B and /A/B/C. Since mirror A was
       already mounted, its vol links do not need to be removed.
maprcli volume link remove -path /A/B
maprcli volume link remove -path /A/B/C
    3. Mount the promoted read-write volumes B and C at the same mount
       points used in the primary (source) cluster, in order to maintain
       an exact replica in the destination cluster.
Cluster2> maprcli volume mount -name B -path /A/B
Cluster2> maprcli volume mount -name C -path /A/B/C
       To mount using MCS, see [2]Mounting one or more Volumes.

   Now the promoted volumes are accessible for write operations.
