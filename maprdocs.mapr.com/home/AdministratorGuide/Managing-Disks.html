Managing Disks

   You can add and remove disks in the MapR-FS from the MapR Control
   System or using the diskadd and diskremove commands. MapR-FS groups
   disks into storage pools, usually made up of two or three disks. When
   adding disks to MapR-FS, it is a good idea to add at least two or three
   at a time so that MapR can create properly-sized storage pools. Each
   node in a MapR cluster can support up to 36 storage pools.

   To see which disks are used by MapR-FS, check the [1]disktab file that
   MapR maintains on each node.
   Warning: For instructions on performing disk maintenance on a node, see
   [2]Performing Maintenance on a Node. If a disk failure alarm is raised
   (NODE_ALARM_DISK_FAILURE), see [3]Handling Disk Failures for
   instructions.

   Refer to the following procedures to manage disks using the MapR
   Control System and the CLI.
