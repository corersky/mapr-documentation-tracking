Factors that Affect RTO

   During a disaster, an administrator must first determine that the link
   is down between the primary datacenter and the secondary datacenter.
   Next, the administrator begins the process of switching applications
   that were running on the primary datacenter over to the secondary
   datacenter. For write applications, the administrator begins converting
   mirror volumes to read-write volumes, starting with volumes that
   contain the most critical data. Note that read applications can run on
   read-only mirrors, but write applications can only run on read-write
   volumes.

   To gauge how long it will take to switch applications from the primary
   datacenter to the secondary datacenter (and to set the RTO
   accordingly), consider these factors:
     * Detection time (how long it takes to determine that the link is
       down between the two datacenters)
     * Switching time (how long it takes to switch applications from one
       datacenter to the other)
     * Promotion time (how long it takes to change read-only mirror
       volumes to read-write volumes that can run write applications).
       Promotion time is based on the number of containers in a volume or
       across volumes.
     * Whether [1]mirror throttling is enabled (the default) or disabled
       (which speeds up the mirroring process)

   Various factors affect how much data can be recovered through the use
   of mirror volumes. To specify a realistic recovery point objective in
   your disaster recovery plan, take these factors into account:
     * Mirror schedule (how often the mirror is synchronized with its
       source volume) Note that the first mirror operation is a full
       synchronization between source and mirror volumes. Subsequent
       mirror operations are incremental - only the changes that occurred
       since the last mirror event need to be copied in order to
       synchronize the contents between the two volumes.
     * Network link between the source volume and the mirror volume
       (consider the stability and quality of the link, as well as
       latency, throughput, and other activities across the link)
