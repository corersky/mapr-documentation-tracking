Enabling Dial Home

   MapR provides a service called Dial Home, which automatically collects
   certain metrics about the cluster for use by support engineers and to
   help us improve and evolve our product. When you first install MapR,
   you are presented with the option to enable or disable Dial Home. We
   recommend enabling it. You can enable or disable Dial Home later, using
   the [1]dialhome enable command.
