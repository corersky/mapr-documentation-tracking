Isolating CLDB Nodes

   In a large cluster (100 nodes or more) create CLDB-only nodes to ensure
   high performance. This configuration also provides additional control
   over the placement of the CLDB data, for load balancing, fault
   tolerance, or high availability (HA). Setting up CLDB-only nodes
   involves restricting the CLDB volume to its own topology and making
   sure all other volumes are on a separate topology. Because both the
   CLDB-only path and the non-CLDB path are children of the root topology
   path, new non-CLDB volumes are not guaranteed to keep off the CLDB-only
   nodes. To avoid this problem, set a default volume topology. See
   [1]Setting Default Volume Topology.
