2. Formatting the Disks (Optional)

   If you are re-using a node that was used previously in another cluster,
   be sure to format the disks by using the [1]disksetup script to remove
   any traces of data from the old cluster. Refer to the previous section,
   [2]Formatting Disks on a Node, for instructions.
