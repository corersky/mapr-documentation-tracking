Allocating Cluster Resource from the Command-Line

   In a MapR Hadoop cluster, warden sets the default resource allocation
   for the operating system, MapR-FS, MapR Hadoop services, and YARN
   applications. Warden allocates resources to MapR Hadoop services and
   applications based on the roles installed on a node. For example,
   warden allocates resources for YARN applications on nodes with
   NodeManager role installed.

   In general, you should not need to override the values set in the
   default configuration files and by warden. However, users can provide
   updated values by adding or updating parameters in the Hadoop site
   configuration files or warden files. To override parameter values for a
   single job, the option can be overridden in the command line when
   submitting a YARN application to the cluster.

   To determine the current value of a hadoop parameter, run hadoop conf |
   grep <ParameterName>. In the following example, the hadoop conf command
   was used to get the value of mapreduce.map.memory.md:
# hadoop conf | grep mapreduce.map.memory.mb
<property><name>mapreduce.map.memory.mb</name><value>1024</value><source>mapred-
site.xml</source></property>

   Alternatively, run hadoop conf without the grep command to get a full
   list of the current parameter values. To determine the current value of
   a warden parameter, open the warden files located in the following
   directories: /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d and /opt/mapr/conf.
   Note: In some cases, the current value of the parameter can only be
   seen in the MCS or in ResourceManager.

   Refer to [1]Allocating Memory for Nodes to allocate memory and
   resources in a MapR cluster.
