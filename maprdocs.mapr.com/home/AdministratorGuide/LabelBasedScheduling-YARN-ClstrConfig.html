Sample Cluster Configuration

   To illustrate the concept of label-based scheduling, consider a cluster
   with two racks: RackA and RackB. The nodes in RackA are dedicated to
   the Production group, and the nodes in RackB are dedicated to the
   Development group. In addition, some nodes are configured with a fast
   CPU, one node is configured with high memory, and one node is
   configured with both a fast CPU and high memory. The following diagram
   illustrates the cluster configuration:
