Setting Node Topology with a Script

   For large clusters, you can specify complex topologies in a text file
   or by using a script. Each line in the text file or script output
   specifies a single node and the full topology path for that node in the
   following format:
<ip or hostname> <topology>

   The text file or script must be specified and available on the local
   filesystem on all CLDB nodes:
     * To set topology with a text file, set net.topology.table.file.name
       in /opt/mapr/conf/cldb.conf to the text file name
     * To set topology with a script, set net.topology.script.file.name in
       /opt/mapr/conf/cldb.conf to the script file name

   If you specify a script and a text file, the MapR system uses the
   topology specified by the script.
