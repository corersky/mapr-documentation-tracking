Specifying Environment Variables

   A subset of the environment variables defined on the servers for the
   MapR cluster must be defined, with the same values, on the client. You
   can add environment variables directly to the startup script, or create
   a local env.sh file in /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/conf. You cannot
   simply copy the env.sh file from a server node in the cluster because
   the MAPR_HOME setting would be different.

   Complete the following steps to specify environment variables:
    1. On a server node in the MapR cluster, locate the env.sh and
       env_override.sh files in the /opt/mapr/conf directory. If the
       env_override.sh file is not present, use the env.sh file. For more
       information about these files, see [1]About env_override.sh.
    2. Retrieve the MAPR_SUBNETS and JAVA_HOME settings from the server
       files and clone them to /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/conf/env.sh on
       the client node.
    3. (Optional) Set the NFS_LOOPBACK_HONOUR_SUBNETS environment variable
       to avoid re-registration whenever there is a change in any network
       interface. Value can be:
          + true to consider the MAPR_SUBNETS while registering with CLDB.
            If set to true, re-registration does not happen whenever there
            is a change in any network interface.
          + false to ignore the MAPR_SUBNETS. If set to false,
            re-registration happens whenever there is a change in any
            network interface.
       For example:
# export NFS_LOOPBACK_HONOUR_SUBNETS=true
# export MAPR_SUBNETS=10.10.104.0/24

# env | grep SUBNET
NFS_LOOPBACK_HONOUR_SUBNETS=true
MAPR_SUBNETS=10.10.105.0/24,10.10.104.0/24
    4. Change the JAVA_HOME setting to point to the location where Java is
       installed on the client.
    5. Add the following lines to the client node env.sh file:
export MAPR_HOME=/usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs
export MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION=/usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/initscripts/mapr-loo
pbacknfs/longlived_ticket
       Note: To allow impersonation, set the value for
       MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION to the path to the mapr user ticket.
    6. Save and close the env.sh file.
    7. Restart the loopbacknfs service for the changes to take effect.
