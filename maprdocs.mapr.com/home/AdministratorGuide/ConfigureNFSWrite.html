Configure NFS Write Performance

   The default RPC requests configuration can negatively impact
   performance and memory. To avoid performance and memory issues,
   configure the number of outstanding RPC requests to the NFS server to
   be 128. The kernel tunable value sunrpc.tcp_slot_table_entries
   represents the number of simultaneous Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
   requests. This tunable's default value is 16. Increasing this value to
   128 may improve write speeds. Use the command sysctl -w
   sunrpc.tcp_slot_table_entries=128 to set the value. Add an entry to
   your sysctl.conf file to make the setting persist across reboots.

   Perform the following steps as the root user on each NFS client
   machine:
    1. Issue the following commands to create the sunrpc.conf file under
       /etc/modprobe.d with the recommended configuration. This enables
       the configuration to persist after a reboot of the NFS client
       machine.
echo "options sunrpc tcp_slot_table_entries=128" >> /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf
echo "options sunrpc tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128" >>  /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.
conf

    2. Issue the following echo commands. This enables the configuration
       to take effect after you remount the NFS client to the NFS gateway.
echo 128 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_slot_table_entries
echo 128 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_max_slot_table_entries
    3. Remount the NFS client to the NFS gateway. Mount the MapR NFS
       server with a rsize/wsize of 128K as this significantly cuts down
       NFS server requests for a given transfer and improves the overall
       performance. For example, the following commands unmount and mount
       the NFS assuming that the cluster is mounted at /mapr.
# umount /mapr
# mount -o nolock,rsize=131072,wsize=131072 <hostname>:/mapr /mapr
    4. After the reboot of the node, if the /proc/sys/sunrpc directory is
       not available or if rpcidmapd is not running, start the rpcidmapd
       service using the following command: service rpcidmapd start.

   Note: Failure to configure this property may result in the following
   error in /opt/mapr/logs/nfsserver.log file:
ERROR nfsserver[38960] fs/nfsd/requesthandle.cc:791 0.0.0.0[0] cannot allocate m
ore OncRpcContexts: [numDropped=2556001] dropping connection from nfsc=10.13.64.

   Note: NFS write performance varies between different Linux
   distributions. This suggested change may have no effect, or even a
   negative effect on your particular cluster.
