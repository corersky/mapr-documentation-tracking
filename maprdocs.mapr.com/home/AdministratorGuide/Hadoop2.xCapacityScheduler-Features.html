Capacity Scheduler Features

   The CapacityScheduler supports these features:
     * Hierarchical Queues Hierarchical queues ensure that resources are
       shared among the sub-queues of an organization before other queues
       are allowed to use free resources, thereby providing more control
       and predictability.
     * Capacity Guarantees Queues are allocated a fraction of the capacity
       of the grid, which means that a certain capacity of resources are
       at their disposal. All applications submitted to a queue have
       access to the capacity allocated to the queue. Administrators can
       configure soft limits and optional hard limits on the capacity
       allocated to each queue.
     * Security Each queue has strict Access Control Lists (ACLs). The
       ACLs control which users can submit applications to individual
       queues. Also, safeguards ensure that users cannot view or modify
       applications from other users. Per-queue and system administrator
       roles are also supported.
     * Elasticity Free resources can be allocated to any queue beyond its
       capacity allocation. As tasks scheduled on these resources
       complete, the resources become available to be reassigned to
       applications on queues running below their capacity. (Note that
       pre-emption is not supported.) This ensures that resources are
       available in a predictable and elastic manner to queues, thus
       preventing artificial silos of resources in the cluster and
       improving cluster utilization.
     * Multi-tenancy A comprehensive set of limits is provided to prevent
       a single application, user, or queue from monopolizing resources of
       the queue or the cluster as a whole. This ensures that the cluster
       is not overwhelmed.
     * Operability
          + Runtime Configuration The queue definitions and properties,
            such as capacity or ACLs, can be changed in a secure manner by
            administrators at runtime, which minimizes disruption to
            users. Also, a console is provided for users and
            administrators to view the current allocation of resources to
            various queues in the system. Administrators can add queues at
            runtime, but queues cannot be deleted at runtime.
          + Drain applications Administrators can stop queues at runtime
            to ensure that while existing applications run to completion,
            no new applications can be submitted. If a queue is in the
            STOPPED state, new applications cannot be submitted to that
            queue or any of its child queues. Existing applications
            continue to completion, so the queue can be drained
            gracefully. Administrators can also start the stopped queues.
     * Resource-based Scheduling Support for resource-intensive
       applications, where an application can optionally specify higher
       resource requirements than the default, thereby accommodating
       applications with differing resource requirements. Currently,
       memory is the only supported resource requirement.
