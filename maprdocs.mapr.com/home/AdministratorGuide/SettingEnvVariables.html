Setting Environment Variables for NIC Segregation

   The MAPR_SUBNETS and MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variables can be used to
   segregate NICs for internal and external clients or to segregate NICs
   for high-performance and low-performance clients.

Setting the MAPR_SUBNETS Environment Variable

   To specify the internal IP addresses of CLDB and MFS nodes:
    1. Stop warden on all the nodes on the cluster.
    2. Set the IP address range to use in the MAPR_SUBNETS environment
       variable in the /opt/mapr/conf/env_override.sh file. For more
       information about this file, see [1]About env_override.sh.
       For example:
export MAPR_SUBNETS=10.10.0.0/24
       To specify multiple subnets for MapR, use comma to separate the IP
       addresses.
       Note: Before specifying the IP address, make sure the client and
       cluster nodes can communicate via that IP address. That is, ensure
       that the client can send packets and that they can be routed to all
       the interfaces of the cluster nodes, and the cluster nodes all have
       a route that reaches back to the client IP address.
    3. Perform a rolling restart of warden on all the nodes for the
       changes to take effect.
    4. Add CLDB’s internal IP address (or IP address specified in the
       MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable on the CLDB host) to the
       mapr-clusters.conf file on the (internal or high-performance)
       client host(s).
       The mapr-clusters.conf file specifies IP addresses, on which the
       CLDB nodes (for one or more clusters) can be reached. For more
       information, see [2]mapr-clusters.conf.

   When you restrict MapR to certain subnets, MapR clients have full
   access to the MapR cluster on the designated subnets.

Setting the MAPR_EXTERNAL Environment Variable

   To specify the external IP addresses of CLDB and MFS nodes:
    1. Stop warden on all the nodes on the cluster.
    2. Set the IP addresses to use for external communication or for
       low-performance clients in the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable
       in the /opt/mapr/conf/env_override.sh file. For more information
       about this file, see [3]About env_override.sh.
       For example:
export MAPR_EXTERNAL=10.11.0.0;
       To specify multiple subnets for MapR, use comma to separate the IP
       addresses.
    3. Perform a rolling restart of warden on all the nodes for the
       changes to take effect.
    4. Add the following in the mapr-clusters.conf file on the (external
       or low-performance) client host(s):
          + CLDB’s external IP addresses, which is the IP addresses
            specified in the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable on the
            CLDB hosts
          + CLDB’s external port, which is the value of the
            CLDB_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT environment variable if this is set on
            the CLDB hosts. See [4]Specifying Ports for CLDB for more
            information.
       The mapr-clusters.conf file contains the IP addresses, on which the
       CLDB nodes (for one or more clusters) can be reached. For more
       information, see [5]mapr-clusters.conf.

Examples

   Suppose the value for the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable on MFS
   node is the following:
10.10.103.80,10.10.30.205

   External clients can connect to MFS on IPs 10.10.103.80, 10.10.30.205
   and the ports on which the MFS is reachable are the default ports. If
   MFS is running 2 instances, then:
     * Instance 1 is reachable on 10.10.103.80:<5660|5692|5724|5756>,
       10.10.30.205:<5660|5692|5724|5756>
     * Instance 2 is reachable on 10.10.30.80:<5661|5693|5725|5757>,
       10.10.30.205:<5661|5693|5725|5757>

   If MFS is running 3 instances:
     * Instance 1 is reachable on 10.10.103.80:<5660|5692|5724|5756>,
       10.10.103.205:<5660|5692|5724|5756>
     * Instance 2 is reachable on 10.10.103.80:<5661|5693|5725|5757>,
       10.10.103.205:<5661|5693|5725|5757>
     * Instance 3 is reachable on 10.10.103.80:<5662|5694|5726|5758>,
       10.10.103.205:<5662|5694|5726|5758>

Specifying External IP Address of ZooKeeper Nodes

   When each ZooKeeper has a different external IP address, the -EZ option
   can be used to specify IP address of each ZooKeeper. To specify the
   external IP address of ZooKeeper nodes, during cluster configuration:
   Run the configure.sh utility as shown below:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C <hostname|IP>[,<hostname|IP>,..] -Z <IP>[,<IP>.
.]  -EZ <IP>[:<port>][,<IP>[:<port>]..] [-F <disk_list_file>] [-N <cluster_name>
]

   In the above command:
     * When each ZooKeeper has a different external IP address, the -EZ
       option can be used to specify IP address of each ZooKeeper and
       optionally the port as well (separated by a colon); the IP address
       can be different while the port number is the same.
     * When there are multiple ZooKeepers listening on the same external
       IP (such as in a Docker container), the -EZ option can be used to
       specify IP address and port (separated by a colon); the port can be
       different while IP address is the same.
