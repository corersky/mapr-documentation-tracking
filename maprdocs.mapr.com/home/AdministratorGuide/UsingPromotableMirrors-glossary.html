Types of Volumes

   This glossary explains the different types of volumes.
   Term Definition
   NC Standard Volume

   A non-convertible standard volume with read-write capabilities, created
   before MapR version 4.0.2. These volumes cannot be converted to
   standard mirror volumes. If this volume type is designated as a source
   volume when a mirror volume is created, the mirror volume will be an NC
   mirror volume.

   An NC standard volume is designated as type 0 in the output of the
   volume info command. For example:

   maprcli volume info -name oldrw

   lists

   "mirrortype":0
   Standard Volume A read-write volume created available as of MapR
   version 4.0.2. A standard volume can be converted from read-write to
   mirror (read-only). If a mirror is created from this type of volume,
   the mirror can be promoted to a read-write volume.

   A standard volume is designated as type rw on the command line. For
   example:

   maprcli volume create -name volA -path /testvol -type rw
   NC Mirror Volume

   A non-convertible read-only mirror volume created before MapR version
   4.0.2. This volume type cannot be promoted to a read-write volume, and
   can only be created from an NC standard volume.

   An NC mirror volume is designated as type 1 in the output of the volume
   info command. For example:

   maprcli volume info -name oldmirror

   lists

   "mirrortype":1
   Standard Mirror

   A mirror volume that starts as read-only, and can be promoted to a
   read-write volume.

   A standard mirror volume is designated as type mirror on the command
   line and can only use a standard volume as its source. For example:

   maprcli volume create -name volB -path /mirvol -type mirror -source
   volA
