Restoring the Mirror Relationship

   If the primary datacenter comes back online, the administrator can
   re-establish the mirror relationship between the original read-write
   volume in the primary datacenter and the promoted read-write volume in
   the secondary datacenter.

   Note that the two read-write volumes will have different data, since
   data was written to the promoted mirror while the original source
   volume was down. The original source volume might also have different
   data that was written after the last mirror operation, but before the
   cluster went down. The administrator must decide which data to keep and
   use as the source.

   Warning: Some data loss is inevitable in a disaster recovery scenario.
   To minimize potential data loss, use mirrors to provide a synchronized
   copy of each volume with critical data, and in the event of
   discrepancies, decide which data to preserve based on your company's
   policies.

   The following sections provide information about how to restore the
   mirror relationship:

   Preserving volA/Cluster1's Data
          Suppose that volA in the primary datacenter contains crucial
          data that must be preserved, and you want to mirror its data to
          volA in the secondary datacenter (the same mirror relationship
          that was established originally). To recreate the original
          mirror relationship, convert the promoted volume, volA/Cluster2,
          from a read-write volume to a mirror of volA/Cluster1 by running
          the following command:

Cluster2> maprcli volume modify -name volA -type mirror -source volA@Cluster1

          To use the MCS to convert volA/Cluster2 from a read-write volume
          to a mirror of volA/Cluster1, follow steps for [1]Changing a
          Standard Volume to a Mirror Volume.

   Preserving volA/Cluster2's Data on volA/Cluster1
          Now suppose you want to preserve the data on volA/Cluster2 (in
          the remote datacenter) but you still want volA/Cluster1 to be
          the primary volume with volA/Cluster2 as its mirror. From the
          command line or the MapR Control System, you can save
          volA/Cluster2's data on volA/Cluster1 and reestablish the
          original mirror relationship from volA/Cluster1 to
          volA/Cluster2.

   You can use either of the following methods to preserve the data:

From the MapR Control System

   Complete the following steps from the MapR Control System to save
   volA/Cluster2's data on volA/Cluster1 and reestablish the original
   mirror relationship from volA/Cluster1 to volA/Cluster2.
    1. Stop writing new data to volA/Cluster2 by making this volume
       read-only:
       For detailed steps, see [2]Modifying a Volume.
    2. Make volA/Cluster1 a mirror of volA/Cluster2.
       For detailed steps, see [3]Changing a Standard Volume to a Mirror
       Volume.
    3. Start mirroring.
       For detailed steps, see [4]Starting the Mirror.
    4. Promote volA/Cluster1 to a read-write volume.
       For detailed steps, see [5]Changing Mirror Volumes to Standard
       Volumes.
    5. Make volA/Cluster2 a mirror of volA/Cluster1.
       For detailed steps, see [6]Changing a Standard Volume to a Mirror
       Volume.

From the Command Line

    1. Stop writing new data to volA/Cluster2. To be sure no data is
       written to this volume, make it read-only by running this command:
Cluster2> maprcli volume modify -name volA -readonly true
    2. Pull the data from volA/Cluster2 to volA/Cluster1 by making
       volA/Cluster1 a mirror of volA/Cluster2.
Cluster1> maprcli volume modify -name volA -type mirror -source volA@Cluster2
    3. Start the mirror operation.
Cluster1> maprcli volume mirror start -name volA
    4. Once mirroring is done, promote volA/Cluster1 to a read-write
       volume. Note that the mirror relationship breaks at this point.
Cluster1> maprcli volume modify -name volA -type rw
    5. Make volA/Cluster2 a mirror of volA/Cluster1.
Cluster2> maprcli volume modify -name volA -type mirror -source volA@Cluster1
