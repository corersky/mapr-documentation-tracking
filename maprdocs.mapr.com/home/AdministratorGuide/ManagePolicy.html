Managing Policies

   You can modify the Purge Interval policy and Server Side Encryption
   settings using the UI. You can also modify the properties directly in
   the properties file.
   Note: Editing the properties both through the service UI and directly
   in the properties file may lead to inconsistencies.

Modifying Purge Interval

    1. Log in to the UI and click [editPolicy.png] associated with the
       purge interval value to edit.
    2. Enter the value you want in the field.
    3. Click [saveEdit.png] to save the changes.
       If you want, you can click [cancelEdit.png] to cancel the edit
       operation.
    4. Restart the service for the changes to take effect.
       See [1]Restarting the Service Using the Service UI.

Enabling or Disabling Server Side Encryption

    1. Log in to the UI and select (to enable) or clear (to disable) the
       checkbox ( [editServersideEncryption.png] ) associated with the
       policy.
    2. Restart the service for the changes to take effect.
       See [2]Restarting the Service Using the Service UI.

Editing Properties in the Properties File

   You can directly edit the
   maprfs:///var/mapr/filemigrate/FileMigrate.properties file. See
   [3]FileMigrate.properties for complete list of properties that can be
   set or modified in the file.
    1. Stop the File Migration service.
    2. Make the necessary changes.
    3. Restart the service using the maprcli command.
       See [4]Starting, Stopping, and Restarting the Service Using the
       CLI.
       Note: If you modified the file directly, you must restart the
       service using the maprcli command.

Removing a Policy

   Log in to the UI and click [deletePolicy.png] associated with the
   policy to remove.
