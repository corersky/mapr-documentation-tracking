Log Collection

   Fluentd collects log events from each node in the cluster and stores
   them in a centralized location so that administrators can search the
   logs when troubleshooting issues in the cluster. The process that
   fluentd uses to parse and send log events to Elasticsearch differs
   based on the formatting of log events in each log file.
   Fluentd uses one or both of the following mechanisms to parse logs:

   multi-line matching
          Using the log time stamp as a delimiter, multi-line matching
          uses the tail plugin to read logs and determine the end of a log
          event. Each log event is sent to Elasticsearch when the next log
          event is written to the log file. This mechanism is often used
          when each log event starts with a timestamp and then includes a
          stack trace.

   multi-pattern matching
          Multi-pattern matching uses the grok plugin to parse logs events
          using complex expressions. This mechanism is often used to parse
          logs events that have non-uniform log formatting.

   Before Fluentd sends the log entries to Elasticsearch, Fluentd assigns
   the following columns to each log event:
   Tag Description
   level The message level of the log entry. For example, info, warning,
   or error.
   class Java or C++ process name associated with the log entry.
   message The log message.
   event_time The time, with millisecond precision, when the log entry was
   written to the log file.
   service_name The name of the service that generated the log entry.
   @timestamp The time, with second precision, when fluentd read the
   message.
   fqdn The node on which the log entry was written.
   clusterid The clusterid of the cluster on which the log was written.
   Note: The log event contents differs based on the service that logs it
   and the type of log. Therefore, the log events sent to Elasticsearch
   may include empty columns.
