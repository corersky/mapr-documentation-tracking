Determine if a disk or partition is ready for use by MapR

   Any disk or partition that passes the following testing procedure can
   be added to the list of disks and partitions passed to the [1]disksetup
   command.
    1. Run the command sudo lsof <partition> to determine whether any
       processes are already using the disk or partition.
       There should be no output when running sudo fuser <partition>,
       indicating there is no process accessing the specific disk or
       partition.
    2. The disk or partition should not be mounted, as checked via the
       output of the mount command. If the disk or partition is mounted,
       unmount it using the umount command.
    3. The disk or partition should not have an entry in the /etc/fstab
       file; comment out or delete any such entries.
    4. The disk or partition should be accessible to standard Linux tools
       such as mkfs. You should be able to successfully format the
       partition using a command like sudo mkfs.ext3 <partition> as this
       is similar to the operations MapR performs during installation. If
       mkfs fails to access and format the partition, then it is highly
       likely MapR will encounter the same problem.
