Setting up Authentication for Users

   The File Migration service uses PAM Shiro to authenticate the user in a
   dialog presented when opening the UI. The service authentication
   consults the PAM configurations in /etc/pam.d in the following order
   (first file in list that exists in that directory is the one used):
    1. mapr-admin
    2. sudo
    3. sshd
    4. passwd

   The UI authorizes the following users to login and use the filemigrate
   service:
     * The owner of the filemigrate process (on the cluster, this will be
       the MAPR_USER).
     * Any users belonging to comma-separated list of authorized users in
       the properties file.
     * Any users belonging to any group in comma-separated list of
       authorized groups in the properties file.

Setting up Authentication for Users in the Properties File

   Specify a comma-separated list of users and/or groups who are
   authorized to log in to the UI in the FileMigrate.properties file in
   maprfs:///var/mapr/filemigrate directory. If the properties file is not
   in the directory, follow the steps in [1]Configuring the File Migration
   Service Using the Properties File.

   To set up the list of users and/or groups manually, set the following
   properties in the FileMigrate.properties file:
     * authorized.users
     * authorized.groups

   To edit the file, see [2]Managing Policies. For more information on the
   properties, see [3]FileMigrate.properties.

Setting up Authentication for Users Using the UI

   Only authorized users can log in to the UI. To set up authentication
   for other users:
    1. Log in to the UI and select Settings from the [gearMenu.png]
       dropdown menu.
       [dropdownMenu.png]
    2. Specify a comma-separated list of:
          + Users in the Authorized Users field under Upload Settings.
          + Groups in the Authorized Groups filed under Upload Settings.
    3. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.
