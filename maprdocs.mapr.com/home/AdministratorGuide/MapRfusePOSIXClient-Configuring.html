Configuring the MapR FUSE-Based POSIX Client

   The POSIX client configuration values can be set in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/fuse.conf file. Edit the configuration file to define
   the values for the following parameters and save the file.

   To ensure that the service can be started and stopped and to run the
   help option, set the shared LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
   Update the shared library environment variable to include the paths to
   the following:
     * Full path to the directory containing libjvm.so file
     * $MAPR_HOME/lib (that is, /opt/mapr/lib directory)

   For example:
Export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.79.x86_64/jre/lib/a
md64/server/:/opt/mapr/lib

   To retrieve the list of configuration parameters, run the following
   command:
/opt/mapr/bin/posix-client-* --help

   Here * refers to basic or platinum client package installed on the
   system. For more information on the non-mapr configuration parameters,
   refer to FUSE [1]documentation.
   Note: The MapR FUSE-based POSIX clients support only the configuration
   parameters in the fuse.conf file. All other FUSE configuration
   parameters are not supported.

   When you install a patch, a new and backup copy of the fuse.conf file,
   fuse.conf.new and fuse.conf.old, are available in the /opt/mapr/conf
   directory. You can find the new parameters in the fuse.conf.new file;
   if needed, you can copy the new parameters to your existing fuse.conf
   file and restart FUSE for the settings to take effect.

   When you upgrade from a prior release, on all supported OS other than
   Ubuntu, the new fuse.conf file and a backup copy of the fuse.conf file
   from prior version named fuse.conf.backup are available in the
   /opt/mapr/conf directory. You can find the new parameters with default
   values in the new fuse.conf file and your custom settings from the
   prior version in the fuse.conf.backup file. On Ubuntu, you can find the
   new fuse.conf file in the /opt/mapr/conf directory and by default, no
   backup copy of the fuse.conf file from prior version is available
   unless you created one before upgrade. To continue using FUSE with your
   custom settings and to avail of the new settings, manually copy your
   custom settings in the fuse.conf.backup file to the new fuse.conf file,
   set custom values for the new parameters in the new fuse.conf file
   where necessary, and restart FUSE-based POSIX client for the settings
   to take effect.
   Parameter Default Value Description
   fuse.mount.point   (Required) Specifies the mount point where MapR-FS
   must be mounted. Ensure that the specified mount point is empty before
   starting the service. Once mounted, the POSIX client has access to all
   the clusters specified in /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file. The
   value should not be /mapr if you wish to mask MapR branding.
   Note: If NFS server is also running on this node, ensure that the FUSE
   mount point is different from the NFS server mount point.
   fuse.log.path /opt/mapr/logs Specifies the path where the log files
   must be stored.
   fuse.client.lib.path /tmp Specifies the path to where the client
   libraries must be stored.
   fuse.allow.other 1 Allow other users to access the mountpoint. Value
   can be:
     * 0 - to not allow other users
     * 1 - to allow other users

   Set this to 1 only if the service is started by the root user and set
   to 0 or comment out this parameter if the service is started by a
   non-root user. If set to 1, also modify the /etc/fuse.conf file to add
   user_allow_other parameter in the file.
   fuse.big.writes 1 Specifies whether to enable writes larger than 4KB.
   Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   This sets the amount of data/buffer size that can be transferred from
   the kernel to the FUSE library per request. If enabled, FUSE will allow
   writes of 128KB from the kernel. If disabled, FUSE will allow writes of
   4KB from the kernel.
   fuse.affinity 0 (disabled) Specifies whether to enable (1) or disable
   (0) NUMA affinity. If enabled, sets the NUMA affinity for the POSIX
   client.
   fuse.auto.unmount 1 (enabled) Specifies whether to automatically
   unmount the filesystem when the process is terminated. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   fuse.num.libs
     * Basic - 1
     * Platinum - 5

   Specifies the number of client libraries to run with. For:
     * Basic client, value must be 1.
     * Platinum client, default value is 5 and can be set to a value
       greater than 5.

   More than one library allows for more than 1GB/sec throughput on remote
   operations as each additional library increases the throughput by
   sharding operations across libraries (for parallelism).
   Note: Each additional library will consume more memory and CPU.
   fuse.ra.sessions
     * Basic - 1
     * Platinum - 5

   Specifies the number of parallel read ahead sessions per library. Each
   open file acts as one read ahead session. For example, for the default
   value of 5, up to 5 files can have read ahead sessions per library. If
   value is set to 0, readahead will be disabled.
   Note: A greater value will allow more number of parallel read ahead
   sessions, which is useful if more number of files need to be opened
   simultaneously. However, note that each additional read ahead session
   will consume more memory (512K per read ahead session) and threads.
   fuse.num.threads 64 Specifies the number of FUSE threads in userspace
   per mountpoint. A higher number allows parallel processing of multiple
   operations. Recommended value is only up to 64.
   fuse.asyncdirect.io 1 (enabled) Specifies whether to enable
   asynchronous direct IO. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   fuse.max.read 128k Specifies the maximum size of read requests.
   fuse.max.readahead 128k Specifies the maximum bytes to readahead.
   fuse.max.write 128k Specifies the maximum size allowed in a (single)
   write request.
   fuse.sync.read 0 Specifies whether to enable or disable synchronized
   reads. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   fuse.max.background 64 Specifies the maximum number of asynchronous
   requests that can be submitted. IOs submits beyond the maximum limit
   (specified here) will be blocked.
   fuse.congestion.threshold 10 Specifies the kernel’s congestion
   threshold.
   fuse.flush.inline 0 Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to flush all
   writes inline. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable inline flushing
     * 1 - flush all writes inline

   If disabled, for all open files, by default, the buffer is flushed
   automatically every 3 seconds or when it reaches 64KB. If enabled,
   writes are sent to server directly.
   fuse.fast.local.directio 0 Specifies whether to optimize or disable
   FUSE client for local direct IO. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - optimize

   fuse.disable.shardcache 0 Specifies whether to disable shard cache,
   which is a cache of lookups. Value can be:
     * 0 - false
     * 1 - true

   If true, more number of lookup calls will be used. The shardcache is
   used by the FUSE client to ensure that requests for data related to the
   same file are served by the same library. This is done using hash to
   improve performance. In very rare circumstances, it might make sense to
   disable this cache in conjunction with MapR support.
   fuse.fsname   Specifies the filesystem source, which is the first field
   in /etc/mtab file. The default value is the FUSE mountpoint.
   fuse.ticketfile.location /opt/mapr/conf/maprfuseticket Specifies the
   ticket to use to start the service in secure mode. Generate the
   required ticket and place it in /opt/mapr/conf/<maprfuseticket>.
   Note: To support impersonation, provide the mapr user ticket file
   location or the user’s servicewithimpersonation ticket file location.
   You can use the mapr user ticket on the server node and service with
   impersonation ticket on client node.The FUSE service must be started by
   the root user if servicewithimpersonation ticket is specified.
   See also: [2]Setting up Ticket for POSIX Client.
   fuse.nonempty 0 Specifies whether FUSE can be mounted at a non-empty
   mountpoint (1) or at an empty mountpoint (0). Value can be:
     * 0 - indicates that mount point should be empty
     * 1 - indicates that mount point need not be empty

   fuse.xattr.enable 0 (false) Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to
   enable extended attributes through the FUSE client. Value can be:
     * 0 - false
     * 1 - true

   The default value is 0 (false). This is disabled by default because if
   enabled, during operations, the kernel might make a lot of extended
   attribute calls for security checks resulting in performance
   degradation even when there are no extended attributes on the inode.
   When disabled, extended attributes can still be added using the hadoop
   fs command; however, this must be enabled to perform any operations on
   extended attributes using the FUSE-based POSIX client.
   Note: Of the five types of extended attribute namespaces in Linux,
   system, trusted, user, raw, and security, only user namespace is
   supported. For all other namespaces, EINVAL is returned.
   fuse.attr.timeout 3.0 The timeout value in seconds for file/directory
   (regular) attributes (such as file size, UID, GID, etc., which are
   normally stored inside the inode) cache. This is used to determine
   whether to use the cached attribute information (only if within the
   specified timeout window) or fetch attribute information again. The
   default is 3.0 second, which specifies that cached attribute
   information must be considered stale and refreshed after 3.0 second.
   For this option, it is possible to give fractions of a second as well
   (for example, fuse.attr.timeout=2.8).

   Set the value for this parameter to 0 to compare POSIX (pjd) compliance
   with ext3/4 filesystem. This disables caching and for better
   performance, this must be avoided.
   fuse.entry.timeout 3.0 The timeout value in seconds for the name lookup
   cache. This is used to determine whether to use the cached entry for
   the name lookup (if within the specified timeout window) or lookup name
   again. The default is 3.0 second, which specifies that cached name
   lookup information must be considered stale and refreshed after 3.0
   second. For this option, it is possible to give fractions of a second
   as well (for example, fuse.entry.timeout=2.8).

   Set the value for this parameter to 0 to compare POSIX (pjd) compliance
   with ext3/4 filesystem. This disables caching and for better
   performance, this must be avoided.
   fuse.hb.interval 5 Specifies the heartbeat interval (in seconds) for
   the FUSE-based POSIX client.
   fuse.export   Specifies the fully-qualified cluster path to the volume
   or directory under the mount point, such as
   /mapr/<cluster>/<volumepath>. For example:
     * Cluster, the value is /<clustername>. The ls /mapr command displays
       the contents under the cluster.
     * Volume on a cluster, value is /<clustername>/volumename>. The ls
       /mapr command displays the contents of the volume. If the value is
       the path to a volume, user can also access the snapshots associated
       with the volume.

   If set as shown above, when the FUSE service is started, the user has
   direct access to the specified volume or directory. The value cannot be
   the path to a file.

   If this is not set, the POSIX client has access to all the clusters in
   the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file. If this property is
   commented out, the ls /mapr displays the contents in the cluster.
   Note: If the value is not a valid path to or name of volume or
   directory, the FUSE service will not start.
   fuse.enforce.core.pattern false Specifies whether (true) or not (false)
   to write to /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern file when the FUSE-based
   POSIX starts. The default value is false. If true, the core_pattern
   file contains an /opt/cores/%e.core.%p.%h entry and if false, the file
   is not touched.
   fuse.access.type rw Sets the type of access on the mount point. Value
   can be:
     * ro — Read only
     * rw — Read and write

   The default value is rw.
   fuse.auto.inval.data 1 Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to
   automatically invalidate the kernel FUSE cache for any data change,
   which causes mtime change, on the files. If set to 1, when the file is
   read, correct file data is returned. If set to 0, kernel cache of the
   data, which might not have the most current change, might be returned.
   fuse.disable.writeback
     * 1 (v6.0.1)
     * 0 (v6.0)

   Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to disable writeback cache. This
   parameter is applicable only in kernel versions >= 3.15. By default, in
   kernel versions >= 3.15, writeback is enabled in MapR v6.0 and disabled
   in MapR v6.0.1. To enable writeback cache, set the value for this
   parameter to 0. If enabled, the writes are buffered in the kernel.
   However, when multiple FUSE clients work on the same file, writes to
   file by one FUSE client might never be seen by other FUSE clients
   performing a read because the kernel does not update the attributes of
   the file unless the file is modified locally. You can disable writeback
   cache to allow the kernel to perform a write through.
   fuse.cluster.conf.location /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf The path
   to the configuration file to use.

   You must start/restart the FUSE-based POSIX client for the changes to
   take effect. See [3]Starting and Stopping the POSIX Client for more
   information.
