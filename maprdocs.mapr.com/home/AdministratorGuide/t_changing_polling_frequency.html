Changing the Polling Frequency

   By default, the pullcentralconfig script polls the central
   configuration location every five minutes (300 seconds) to check for
   configuration files.
    1. You can change the polling frequency by editing this variable in
       warden.conf:
pollcentralconfig.interval.seconds
    2. To make the change take effect, restart Warden:
root$> service mapr-warden restart
