Removing and Replacing Disks

   If a disk fails due to a hardware problem, you will need to remove the
   disk. You can replace it, and then add that disk back to MapR-FS along
   with the other disks that were automatically removed at the same time.

   Refer to the following for information on how to remove and replace
   disks using the MapR command-line interface and the MapR Control
   System:
     * [1]Removing Disks from MapR-FS
     * [2]Adding Disks to MapR-FS
