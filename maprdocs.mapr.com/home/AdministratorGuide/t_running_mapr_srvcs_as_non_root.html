Running MapR Services as a Non-Root User

    1. Stop Warden: service mapr-warden stop
service mapr-warden stop
    2. If ZooKeeper is installed on the node, stop it: service
       mapr-zookeeper stop
service mapr-zookeeper stop
    3. If the MAPR_USER does not exist, create the user/group with the
       same UID and GID.
    4. If the MAPR_USER exists, verify that the uid of MAPR_USER is the
       same same as the value on the CLDB node.
    5. Run $INSTALL_DIR/server/config-mapr-user.sh -u MAPR_USER
    6. If Zookeeper is installed, start it: service mapr-zookeeper start
service mapr-zookeeper start
    7. Start Warden: service mapr-warden start
service mapr-warden start
    8. After clearing NODE_ALARM_MAPRUSER_MISMATCH alarms on all nodes,
       run $INSTALL_DIR/server/upgrade2mapruser.sh on all nodes wherever
       the alarm is raised.
