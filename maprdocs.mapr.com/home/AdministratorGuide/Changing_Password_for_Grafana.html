Changing the Password for Grafana

   This page describes how to change the Grafana password for secure and
   nonsecure clusters.

Secure Clusters

   To change the Grafana password for a secure cluster, you must change
   the password for the MapR cluster admin user. How you change the
   password depends on the security implementation. For example, if your
   security implementation is PAM and LDAP, you would use LDAP to change
   the cluster admin password.
   Note: If the cluster is secure, attempting to change the Grafana
   password using the Grafana UI has no effect.

Nonsecure Clusters

   For a nonsecure cluster:
    1. Log in to the interface using the admin user ID and the password
       that you specified for the admin user ID when you installed the
       cluster.
    2. Select Home > Admin > Profile.
    3. On the User Profile screen, click Change Password, located near the
       bottom of the screen.
    4. Enter and save the new password.
