Logging on to Kibana

   This page describes the credentials needed to log on to Kibana for
   secure and nonsecure clusters for MapR 6.0 and later.

   Elasticsearch has its own user database, which also serves Kibana. MEP
   5.0.0 and MapR Installer 1.9.0 implemented some changes in security
   that affect the user IDs and passwords you need to log on to Kibana.

MEP 4.x.x

   To log on, specify the user and password as follows:
                  Secure Cluster        Nonsecure Cluster
   User     Type the Kibana admin user. No logon required.
   Password Type admin.                 No logon required.

MEP 5.0.0 and Later

   To log on, specify the user and password as follows:
     Secure Cluster Nonsecure Cluster
   User Type the Kibana admin user ID. No logon required.
   Password Type the ElasticSearch/Kibana password that you specified
   during cluster installation. No logon required.
