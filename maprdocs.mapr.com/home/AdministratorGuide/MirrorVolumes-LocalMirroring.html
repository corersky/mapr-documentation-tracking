Local Mirroring

   A local mirror volume is a mirror volume whose source is on the same
   cluster. Local mirror volumes are useful for load balancing or for
   providing a read-only copy of a data set.

   You can locate your local mirror volumes in specific servers or on
   racks with particularly high bandwidth, mounted in a public directory
   separate from the source volume.

   The most frequently accessed volumes in a cluster are likely to be the
   root volume and its immediate children. In order to load-balance read
   operations on these volumes, mirror the root volume (typically
   mapr.cluster.root, which is mounted at /). By mirroring these volumes,
   read requests can be served from the mirrors, distributing load across
   the nodes. Less-frequently accessed volumes that are lower in the
   hierarchy do not need mirror volumes. Since the mount paths for those
   volumes are not mirrored throughout, those volumes are writable.
