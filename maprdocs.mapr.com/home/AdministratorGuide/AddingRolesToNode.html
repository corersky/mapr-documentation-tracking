Adding Roles to a Node

   You can add roles on a node after you deploy the node in a cluster. The
   process of adding a role to a node involves installing a package on the
   node and updating the cluster to recognize the new role. The process
   for adding a role depends on the role type.
   Once you have added a role to a node, you must restart Warden. Observe
   the following best practices when restarting Warden on ZooKeeper and
   CLDB nodes:
     * Perform a rolling restart of Warden to ensure that all services are
       up. A rolling restart of Warden means restart Warden on each node,
       one at a time, pausing until the last restart finishes before
       beginning the next.
     * To avoid a failover from occurring, identify nodes running critical
       services, such as ResourceManager, and restart Warden last on those
       nodes.
     * Restart Warden on nodes that run critical cluster services, such as
       ResourceManager, during periods of low activity.
