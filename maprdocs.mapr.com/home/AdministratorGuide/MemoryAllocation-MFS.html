Allocating Memory for the mfs Service

   By default, Warden adds up the total memory consumed by all services
   and the OS and then gives 85% of what is left to YARN. If you do not
   intend to use MapR-DB, you can set the -noDB option in configure.sh to
   specify that 20% of the memory available should be allocated to mfs
   service. If you can give more memory to MapR-FS, performance improves
   due to greater data caching. If your main constraint is disk I/O, this
   is especially important. For the parameters that you can configure to
   give Warden more memory, see [1]Allocating Memory for the OS, MapR-FS,
   and Hadoop Services.
