Failing Over to a Mirror Volume

   When a disaster occurs at a primary datacenter, data can no longer be
   written to the volumes in that location, and the mirror operation
   cannot be performed. In order to maintain business continuity, the
   administrator at the secondary datacenter promotes the read-only mirror
   volume to a read-write volume, which breaks the mirror relationship. At
   this point, the promoted mirror volume contains all the data that was
   on the source volume at the time of the most recent successful mirror
   operation.
