Managing Permissions

   You can manage user permissions at the cluster, volume, and file system
   levels. Cluster and volume permissions use access control lists (ACLs)
   to specify which actions a user can perform on a cluster or volume.
   File system permissions and access control expressions (ACEs) control
   user access to volumes, directories, and files, similar to Linux file
   permissions. Users get the permissions that are directly assigned to
   them as well as the permissions assigned to the groups they are in. You
   must have fc permissions to manage permissions.
