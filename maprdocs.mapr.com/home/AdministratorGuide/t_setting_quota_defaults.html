Setting Quota Defaults for Users and Groups

   Quotas limit the disk space used by a volume or an entity (user or
   group) on an Enterprise Edition-licensed cluster, by specifying the
   amount of disk space the volume or entity is allowed to use. A volume
   quota limits the space used by a volume. A user/group quota limits the
   space used by all volumes owned by a user or group.

   You can set hard quota and advisory quota defaults for users and
   groups. When a user or group is created, the default quota and advisory
   quota apply unless overridden by specific quotas. You can set an entity
   quota that differs from the default using the [1]entity modify command
   or through the MapR Control System.

   The size of a disk space quota is expressed in terms of the actual data
   stored from the user's point of view. Only post-compression data blocks
   are counted, and snapshot and replica space does not count against
   quotas. For example, a 10G file that is compressed to 8G and has a
   replication factor of 3 consumes 24G (3*8G), but charges only 8G to the
   user or volume's quota.

   You can set an entity quota through the MapR Control System and using
   the CLI.

Setting Quotas Using MCS

   Complete the following steps to set the entity quota in the MapR
   Control System:
    1. Go to Admin > Cluster Settings > Quotas.
    2. Set the advisory and hard quotas for the:
          + User under USER QUOTA.
          + Group under GROUP QUOTA.
       Hard quota prevents writes above the specified threshold. Advisory
       quota does not enforce disk usage limit, but raises an alarm when
       the specified threshold is exceeded:
          + AE_ALARM_AEADVISORY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED - an entity exceeded its
            advisory quota
          + VOLUME_ALARM_ADVISORY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED - a volume exceeded its
            advisory quota
       In most cases, it is useful to set the advisory quota somewhat
       lower than the hard quota, to give advance warning that disk usage
       is approaching the allowed limit.
    3. Set the cluster reserve limit, which is the amount of disk space
       you wish to allocate for all volumes on the cluster.
       When you set a reserve limit, you provision a certain amount of
       space to the volumes as a percentage of the cluster capacity. This
       allows you to free up space that could potentially be unused or
       allocate more space for replication.
       As data is written to the volume, available space is automatically
       allocated. The volume reserve increases up to the reserve limit you
       set here.
    4. After setting the quota, click Save to exit save changes to the
       entity.

Setting Entity Quotas Using the CLI or the REST API

   To set an entity (user or group) quota, run the following command:
maprcli entity modify -name <entityname> -advisoryquota <advisory quota> -quota
<quota>

   To manage quotas, you must have a or fc permissions.

   Quotas are expressed as an integer value plus a single letter to
   represent the unit:
     * B - bytes
     * K - kilobytes
     * M - megabytes
     * G - gigabytes
     * T - terabytes
     * P - petabytes

   Example: 500G specifies a 500-gigabyte quota. Do not use two-letter
   abbreviations for units, such as MB or GB.

   For complete reference inforamtion, see [2]entity modify.

Setting Cluster Reserve Limit Using the CLI or REST API

   To set the resource usage limit for the cluster's disk resource, run
   the following command:
maprcli rlimit set -resource disk -cluster <cluster name> -value <limit>

   For complete reference information, see [3]rlimit set.
