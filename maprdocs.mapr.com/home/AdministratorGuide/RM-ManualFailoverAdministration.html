Manual Failover Administration

   Configure manual failover for the ResourceManager if you want to
   manually transition the state of ResourceManagers in the cluster. In
   the event of a ResourceManager failure, you use rmadmin commands to
   check the status of each ResourceManager and then transition a standby
   ResourceManager to the active state.
