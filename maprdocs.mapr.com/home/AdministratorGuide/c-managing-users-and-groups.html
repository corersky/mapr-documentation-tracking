Managing Users and Groups

   The following two users are important when installing and setting up
   MapR software:
     * root is used to install MapR software on each node.
     * The “MapR user” is the user that MapR services run as (typically
       named mapr or hadoop) on each node. The MapR user has full
       privileges to administer the cluster. Administrative privilege with
       varying levels of control can be assigned to other users as well.

   Before installing MapR, decide on the name, user id (UID) and group id
   (GID) for the MapR user. The MapR user must exist on each node, and the
   user name, UID and primary GID must match on all nodes.
     * When adding a user to a cluster node, specify the --uid option with
       the useradd command to guarantee that the user has the same UID on
       all machines.
     * When adding a group to a cluster node, specify the --gid option
       with the groupadd command to guarantee that the group has the same
       GID on all machines.

   MapR uses each node's native operating system configuration to
   authenticate users and groups for access to the cluster. If you are
   deploying a large cluster, you should consider configuring all nodes to
   use LDAP or another user management system. You can use the MapR
   Control System to give specific permissions to particular users and
   groups. For more information, see [1]Setting User Permissions. Each
   user can be restricted to a specific amount of disk usage. For more
   information, see [2]Setting Quotas for Users and Groups.

   By default, MapR gives the user root full administrative permissions.
   If the nodes do not have an explicit root login, give full permissions
   to another user after deployment. See [3]Adding Cluster Permissions.

   On the node where you plan to run the mapr-apiserver (the MapR Control
   System), install Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). See [4]PAM
   Configuration for more information.

   You can perform the following procedures to manage users and groups in
   a MapR cluster using the MapR Control System (click Admin > User
   Settings) and the CLI:
