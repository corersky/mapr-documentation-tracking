Setting Up Volume Topology

   MapR supports data placement control, in which you can place a volume
   on specific racks, nodes, or groups of nodes by setting its topology to
   an existing node topology. You can set volume topology using the MapR
   Control System or with the [1]volume move command.

   To move an existing volume to another topology, you must have the
   [2]Converged Enterprise Edition installed on your system. Without the
   Converged Enterprise Edition, when you try to move a volume to another
   topology, the following error message is returned:
ERROR (10010) - Volume Move: No license for requested operation

Setting Up Volume Topology in the MapR Control System

   You can set up volume topology at the time of volume creation or change
   the volume topology after volume creation. To:
     * Set up volume topology at the time of volume creation, see
       [3]Creating a Volume.
     * Modify volume topology, see [4]Modifying a Volume.

Setting Up Volume Topology Using the CLI or REST API

   To move a volume to a different topology, run the following command:
maprcli volume move -name <volume name> -topology <path>

   For complete reference information, see [5]volume move.
