Reducing Failure Detection Time for File Clients

   To reduce the amount of time it takes (hadoop and FUSE-based POSIX)
   clients to detect (CLDB and data node) failure, define the property,
   fs.mapr.connect.timeout, in the core-site.xml file. The value for this
   property can be set in 100 milliseconds and will be rounded up to the
   nearest 100 milliseconds. The minimum value for this property is 100
   milliseconds, which can be incremented only by units of 100
   milliseconds. Suppose a value of 260 milliseconds is specified, by
   default, the value will automatically be rounded up to 300
   milliseconds. The default value for this property is 0, which means
   that the Linux TCP timeout setting will be used for connections if this
   property is not set.

   Your entry in core-site.xml file should look similar to the following:
<property>
  <name>fs.mapr.connect.timeout</name>
  <value>200</value>
  <description>file client wait time of 200 milliseconds</description>
</property>

   This setting (for hadoop and FUSE-based POSIX clients) ensures that the
   clients wait only for the specified amount of time to establish a
   connection. That is, it is used only for the first request sent to CLDB
   or a data node before or after a failure. For subsequent requests, the
   default system connection timeout value is used. In the event of a
   failure after a connection has been established, the client will wait
   for the connection to timeout (based on the system timeout value)
   before it contacts the next (CLDB or data) node to process the request.

   For example, suppose the value for this parameter is 100 milliseconds
   and the Linux TCP connection timeout value is 30 seconds. When a hadoop
   or FUSE-based POSIX client contacts CLDB or a data node for the first
   time to establish a connection, the client will wait for 100
   milliseconds before trying the next CLDB or data node. After a
   connection is established, for subsequent requests, the client will
   wait for 30 seconds for a response. If the node goes down after a
   connection has been established, the client will wait for 30 seconds
   before trying the next node. If the client contacts a recovered node
   for the first time, it will wait for 100 milliseconds to establish the
   connection.
   Note: MapR-FS does not use this property internally; it is used by
   hadoop and FUSE-based POSIX clients only. This setting is not
   applicable to NFS gateway and loopbacknfs POSIX clients.
