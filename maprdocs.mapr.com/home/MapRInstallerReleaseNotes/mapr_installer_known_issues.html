MapR Installer Known Issues

   This topic describes some MapR Installer known issues that you should
   be aware of while troubleshooting.
   Issue Description
   IN-1904 If you initiate a system startup by clicking the Startup button
   on the MapR Installer web interface, the Authentication screen is
   displayed. If you subsequently click the Previous button, the following
   buttons are shown as active even though they are not usable during
   system startup:
     * Extend Cluster
     * Incremental Install
     * Maintenance Update
     * Shutdown
     * Uninstall

   Workaround: Do not use the Previous button during startup.
   IN-1657 After [1]updating MapR Installer 1.7 or later, the Installer
   can lose awareness that a cluster was previously installed. For
   example, the MapR Installer might indicate the need for a fresh
   install.
   Workaround: If this happens, do NOT proceed with installation or
   upgrade operations. Follow these steps to reset the cluster state:
    1. Click Support > Reset Installer. A warning screen appears.
    2. Click OK.
    3. Click Support > Import State.
    4. Click Reset to recover the cluster to the last known state. It is
       safe to use the MapR Installer at this point.

   IN-1084 For MapR 6.0 or later clusters, enabling security by using the
   [2]Incremental Install function can overwrite custom certificates in
   the ssl_truststore and ssl_keystore files. When you turn on security,
   the MapR Installer runs the configure.sh script on the CLDB master node
   to generate security keys and then distributes the keys to all the
   other CLDB nodes. The installer also distributes certificates to all
   the other nodes. This process can cause custom certificates to be
   overwritten. However, before enabling security, the MapR Installer
   makes a backup of the exisiting ssl_keystore and ssl_truststore files.
   Workaround: After enabling security, locate the backup of the
   ssl_keystore and ssl_truststore files. The backup uses this format:
/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore.sv.<timestamp>

   Extract any custom certificates from the backup files, and manually
   merge or add them into the new ssl_keystore and ssl_truststore files.

   To merge the files, you can use the /opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh
   utility, as shown in [3]Configuring Secure Clusters for Running
   Commands Remotely.
   IN-997 When using MapR Installer 1.9 with Ubuntu distributions, an
   upgrade of the MapR Installer definitions requires a restart of the
   installer service. The restart is needed because the MapR Installer
   services version is not updated properly when you use either of the
   following commands:
     * mapr-setup.sh reload
     * apt-get install mapr-installer-definitions

   Workaround: After installing or reloading the MapR Installer
   definitions, issue one of these commands to fix the services version:
     * service mapr-installer restart
     * systemctl restart mapr-installer

   IN-1671 For MapR Installer 1.8 and earlier, installation on Ubuntu
   16.04 can fail if Python 2 is not available or if the default is set to
   Python 3. The installer requires python and python-yaml to be installed
   on all nodes.
   Workaround: To install the Python packages manually:
sudo apt-get install python python-yaml -y

   IN-1277 The Retry function for the MapR Installer license page can fail
   when you try to install a trial license for a new installation.

   Workaround: Complete the installation. Then use MCS or the command line
   to add the license. See [4]Managing Licenses.
   IN-1336 The MapR Installer Retry function can be affected if the
   installer operation fails. Suppose you deselect a service during an
   Incremental Install operation. If the Incremental Install fails and you
   need to Retry, it's possible that the service will not be deselected
   (uninstalled).
   Workaround: Manually remove (uninstall) the service by using one of
   these commands:
     * Red Hat / CentOS: yum remove
     * Ubuntu: apt-get remove
     * SUSE: zypper remove

   IN-1392 During an Extend Cluster (add node) operation using the MapR
   Installer, if installation of the added node fails and you abort the
   operation, the installer can display the added node even though it did
   not get installed.

   Workaround: When the MapR Installer indicates that a node did not get
   added correctly (typically during the Installation phase), select the
   node and click Remove Node. Then retry adding the node.
   IN-1396 An installation using the MapR Installer fails with the
   following Ansible module error:
nValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

   Workaround: Check for syntax errors in the /etc/sysctl.conf file, which
   can cause an Ansible error when the MapR Installer is attempting to set
   various kernel parameters.
   IN-1398 In the MapR Installer Verify Nodes page, if you click a host,
   the Disks Selected for MapR box in the right pane displays the disks
   that were specified for the host either manually or automatically. If
   you deselect a disk in the right pane and click Retry, the deselection
   is not always implemented.

   Workaround: Click Previous to go back to the Node Configuration page,
   and re-specify the disks that you want. Then continue with the
   operation.
   IN-1386 On a secure MapR cluster, YARN jobs can fail if you specify IP
   addresses rather than host names when you configure nodes using the
   MapR Installer.

   Workaround: Do not use an IP address for node configuration with the
   MapR Installer. If you already used an IP address, change the IP
   address in the [5]yarn-site.xml file on all nodes. In the following
   example, the 10.10.10.7 IP address must be changed to a host name, such
   as bld73.qa.lab:
<property>
<name>yarn.timeline-service.hostname</name>
<value>10.10.10.73</value>
</property>

   IN-1333 On Ubuntu clusters, the mapr-setup.sh script fails to reload
   the MapR Installer definitions during an update of the MapR installer
   and definitions.
   Workaround: After updating, restart the installer to load the
   definitions:
service mapr-installer restart

   IN-907 The MapR Installer service fails if the mapr user or root user
   already exist and they are configured to use a shell other than bash.
   For more information about user requirements, see the [6]MapR Installer
   Prerequisites and Guidelines.
   IN-1079 Verification fails when the installed language pack is for a
   language other than English.
   Workaround: Remove the non-English language pack and install the
   English language pack. In the following example, the non-English
   language pack is shown as German. Also, make sure your system locale is
   set to en_us, as described in [7]Infrastructure.
sudo apt-get install language-pack-en language-pack-en-base manpages
sudo apt-get remove language-pack-de language-pack-de-base manpages-de

   IN-804 Using the Incremental Install operation to add a third node to a
   CONTROL group generates an error: ERROR: configure_refresh.sh failed.
   This issue applies to MapR Installer versions 1.6 and earlier.

   Workaround: [8]Update the installer to version 1.7, and retry the
   operation.
   IN-1314 When you use the MapR Installer to install ecosystem components
   that require a MySQL component such as Hive, Oozie, or Hue, the
   passwords you provide to install the MySQL database are displayed in
   the mapr-installer.log and <nodename>.log files. Beginning with MapR
   Installer 1.7, the permissions for the mapr-installer.log and
   <nodename>.log files are changed so that these passwords are not world
   readable. However, the passwords are still present in log files created
   with earlier versions of the MapR Installer.

   Workaround: For increased security, remove the earlier logs or change
   the user permissions for them.
   IN-646 An upgrade using the MapR Installer can fail if ansible
   processes hang. Performing a service mapr-installer restart does not
   help. The installer-process.log indicates Lock file
   /opt/mapr/installer/data/mapr-installer.lock exists.

   Workaround: Follow the steps in the [9]Mapr-Installer-error-lock-file
   knowledge base article to kill any running ansible processes and retry
   the installation process.
   IN-1042 Installation of the 5.2.x mapr-metrics package on SUSE 12 SP2
   fails because the libmysqulclient16 package is not present. This can
   happen when mapr-metrics is installed manually or using the MapR
   Installer. This issue was detected during installations of MapR 5.2.x
   with MEP 3.0.0.

   Workaround: None.
   IN-870 If your cluster uses [10]2-digit MEPs and you use the MapR
   Installer [11]Extend Cluster button to add a node, the node can be
   added with a patch version that is different from the patch version of
   other nodes in the cluster.

   A one-time change can prevent this issue. After [12]updating the MapR
   Installer from version 1.5 to version 1.6 or later, but before
   performing any MapR Installer operations, use an [13]Incremental
   Install to change your 2-digit MEP version to the equivalent 3-digit
   MEP version.
   ES-27, IN‑1387 On a new installation of a secure cluster using the MapR
   Installer, Elasticsearch fails to start, and logs indicate that
   Elasticsearch key generation failed. When this happens, Kibana and
   Fluentd also do not start. The MapR Installer allows the installation
   to complete.

   Workaround: Check the installer log for a message indicating that
   Elasticsearch could not be secured. Use the Incremental Install feature
   of the MapR Installer to retry installation of the MapR Monitoring
   logging components. Alternatively, you can configure security for the
   logging components manually. See [14]Step 9: Install Log Monitoring.
   IN-1332 On clusters with less than the recommended memory configuration
   (16 GB per node), services added during an [15]Incremental Install
   operation might fail to start because Warden allocated available memory
   to the MapR file system. The MapR Installer might not indicate a
   problem with the newly added services. If this issue occurs, the MapR
   file system cannot relinquish memory without restarting Warden.
   Note: This issue can also occur on clusters with more than 16 GB of
   memory per node if the installed services require more memory than is
   currently installed.

   Workaround: Use MCS or the maprcli service list -node command to
   determine if the added services are running. If not, perform a rolling
   restart of the nodes to which the new services were added. The rolling
   restart will rebalance memory across the file system and services. One
   node at a time, restart Warden on each node following the group upgrade
   order prescribed in [16]Manual Rolling Upgrade. Use the following
   steps:
    1. Change to the root user (or use sudo for the following commands).
    2. Stop Warden.
sudo service mapr-warden stop
    3. Restart Warden.
service mapr-warden start

   IN-1339 Installation fails with the MapR Installer reporting an
   Unexpected failure during module execution, and the following entry is
   present in the [17]mapr-installer.log:
os.write(self.sshpass_pipe[1], to_bytes(self._play_context.password) + b'\n')
OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

   Workaround:
   Change the ssh settings as described in known issue IN-405 later on
   this page, and retry the installation.
   IN-553 New installations on Ubuntu 14.04 using MapR Installer 1.6 or
   1.7 can fail because of a JDK 1.8 issue.

   Workaround: If you are installing on Ubuntu 14.04, you must install
   Java JDK 1.8 before running the MapR Installer. For more information,
   see [18]this website. If you are installing on RHEL/CentOS or SUSE, the
   MapR Installer installs Java JDK 1.8 for you.
   IN-405 MapR installation or [19]cluster import fails with the error
   message: "Failed to resolve remote temporary directory from
   ansible-tmp- ...."

   Workaround: To proceed using the MapR Installer, disable SSH connection
   reuse by including this entry underneath the [ssh_connection] property
   of /opt/mapr/installer/etc/ansible.cfg:
ssh_args=-o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -o ControlPersist=no

   This workaround can lead to longer install times. We recommend that you
   resolve any network connectivity issues in your environment.
   IN-250 An upgrade to a new MapR core version and a new MEP using the
   MapR Installer can fail if the cluster being upgraded was initially
   installed with Hive Metastore but not with Hive. The Hive Metastore
   package has an installation dependency on Hive, but the Hive Metastore
   definitions do not enforce the dependency, resulting in inconsistencies
   in the installer database. This issue has been observed on Ubuntu
   platforms.

   Workaround: Before upgrading, if you have Hive Metastore installed by
   itself, use the Incremental Install feature of the MapR Installer to
   install Hive. Then proceed with the upgrade.

   Performing an upgrade without doing the Incremental Install of Hive
   will cause the upgrade to fail. In this scenario, you will have to
   reinstall or rebuild the database by using Stanza commands. You can use
   the reset command, followed by probe, and then edit the versions in the
   resulting YAML file. The last step is to import the edited YAML using
   the import command. See [20]Using probe and import to Generate the
   Installer Database.
   N/A The MapR Installer Web Interface can inadvertently deselect
   services that you have selected, preventing them from being installed.
   For example, if you select an auto-provisioning template on the Select
   Services page, and you also select additional services (for example,
   Streams Tools), and go to the next page, when you return to the Select
   Services page, Streams Tools will be deselected, and you will need to
   reselect it to ensure that it is installed.
   MapR‑22652 The MapR Installer does not prevent the selection of Impala
   2.2 when the cluster will be installed on Ubuntu nodes. Since Impala
   2.2 is not supported on Ubuntu, the installation will not complete
   successfully.
   MapR‑20606 The Configure Service Layout page may assign services to a
   group with the name "Unprovisioned Services."

   Workaround: In the MapR Installer Web Interface, click Restore Default.
   N/A You cannot use the MapR Installer after you upgrade the cluster
   using the command line.

   After you use the command line to upgrade a cluster that you installed
   with the MapR Installer, the MapR Installer is not aware that the
   cluster runs the upgraded version. Therefore, MapR Installer does not
   install nodes and ecosystem components that apply to the upgraded
   version.

   Workaround: Use the MapR Installer Stanzas probe and import commands to
   update the installer database. See [21]Using probe and import to
   Generate the Installer Database.
   MapR-19727 On nodes running RedHat/CentOS 6.5 or older, JDK 1.7 may
   cause an SSL connection error when you attempt to access the MapR
   Installer web interface.

   Workaround:
    1. Install JDK 1.8.
    2. Use the alternatives system to set JDK 1.8 as the default Java. Or,
       uninstall JDK 1.7.

   MapR-18668 Hue does not work on RedHat/CentOS 7 when it is configured
   to use a MySQL database.

   When this issue occurs, the MapR Control System (MCS) displays the "Hue
   Down Alarm."
   Workaround:
    1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the Redhat 6
       compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
ver=$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d- -f2)
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$ver/rhel7-amd64/rpms/MariaDB-$ver-cent
os7-x86_64-compat.rpm
    2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus SASL
       library:
ln -s /lib64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /lib64/libsasl2.so.2
    3. Run the following command to reconfigure Hue:
bash -c "source /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/build/env/bin/activate;
      /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/build/env/bin/hue syncdb --noinput;
      /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/build/env/bin/hue migrate"
    4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <space separated list of
      hostnames>

   MapR-18574 Installation may fail on nodes where there is a package
   manager running or a stale lock file exists. When this type of failure
   occurs, the installation log for that node may contain an error message
   similar to the following:
2015-05-08 01:50:22.713: failed: [command /usr/bin/apt-get install -q -y {{mapr.
node.core_packages|sort|join(' ') }}] [10.10.10.162] => {"changed": true,"cmd":
["/usr/bin/apt-get", "install", "-q", "-y", "mapr-cldb",
      "mapr-core","mapr-fileserver", "mapr-httpfs", "mapr-nfs", "mapr-nodemanage
r","mapr-resourcemanager", "mapr-webserver", "mapr-zookeeper"], "delta":"0:00:05
.432067", "end": "2015-05-08 01:50:22.676193", "rc": 100,
      "start":"2015-05-08 01:50:17.244126", "warnings": ["Consider using apt-get
 modulerather than running apt-get"]}

   Workaround: To clean up a running package manager process, run apt-get
   or yum on a shell and follow the instructions provided by the package
   manager.
   Note: When you select a node on the “Installing MapR” page, the option
   to view the installation log for that node displays in the left panel.
   MapR-18507 Metrics does not work on these operating systems: Ubuntu,
   RedHat 7, and SUSE/SLES 12.
   MapR-18388 Known issues with spark-standalone and multiple spark
   masters:
     * After installation, Spark workers may not start due to the
       mechanism used to start services.
     * Spark worker does not start after the node that runs the worker is
       restarted.

   Workaround:To start Spark workers, run the following command as the
   mapr user on each worker node:
/opt/mapr/spark/spark-$VERSION/sbin/start-slave.sh 1 spark://<comma-separated li
st of spark
      master hostname: port>

   Example:
/opt/mapr/spark/spark-$VERSION/sbin/start-slave.sh 1
     spark://host1:7077,host2:7077

   It is important to list all the spark master hostnames so that the
   worker nodes can connect to the active master.
   You can run the following command to determine the nodes that run the
   spark master:
maprcli node list -columns service -filter '[service==spark-master]' -json | gre
p
      \"hostname\": | cut -d \" -f 4
