   Cascadingâ„¢ is a Java application framework produced by Concurrent, Inc.
   that enables developers to quickly and easily build rich
   enterprise-grade Data Processing and Machine Learning applications that
   can be deployed and managed across private or cloud-based Hadoop
   clusters.
   Note: Cascading is not part of MapR distribution and not supported by
   MapR. However, like many other open source technologies, it can be used
   with MapR. The following information provides relevant details about
   using Cascading with MapR.
