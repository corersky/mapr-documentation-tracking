Kafka REST 2.0.1: POST /consumers/{group: string}/instances/{instance:
string}/offsets

   Commit offsets for the consumer. Returns a list of the partitions with
   the committed offsets.

Description

   The body of this request is empty. The offsets are determined by the
   current state of the consumer instance on the proxy. The returned state
   includes both consumed and committed offsets. After a successful
   commit, these should be identical; however, both are included so the
   output format is consistent with other API calls that return the
   offsets.
   Note: This request must be made to the specific REST proxy instance
   holding the consumer instance.

   CAPTION: Table 1. Parameters

        Parameters                Description
   group_name (string)  The name of the consumer group.
   instance_id (string) The ID of the consumer instance.

Response Example

   The response JSON object is in the following form:
     * topic (string) – Name of the topic for which an offset was
       committed.
     * partition (int) – Partition ID for which an offset was committed.
     * consumed (long) – The offset of the most recently consumed message.
     * committed (long) – The committed offset value. If the commit was
       successful, this should be identical to consumed
