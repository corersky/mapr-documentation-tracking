HDFS Connector

   These topics describe the Kafka Connect 4.0.0 for MapR-ES HDFS
   connector, driver, and configuration parameters.

   The HDFS connector allows you to export data from MapR-ES topics to
   MapR-FS or HDFS files in a variety of formats. In addition, Hive
   integration is available, which can be use to make data immediately
   available for querying with HiveQL.
