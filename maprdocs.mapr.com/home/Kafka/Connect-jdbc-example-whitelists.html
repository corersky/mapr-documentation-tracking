Whitelists and Custom Query JDBC Examples

   This section provides common usage scenarios using whitelists and
   custom queries.

Using Whitelists

   Use a whitelist to limit changes to a subset of tables in a MySQL
   database, using id and modifiedcolumns that are standard on all
   whitelisted tables to detect rows that have been modified. This mode is
   the most robust because it can combine the unique, immutable row IDs
   with modification timestamps to guarantee modifications are not missed
   even if the process dies in the middle of an incremental update query.

   The following is an example of a whitelist.
   Note: Before running this example, you need to create the stream
   /kafka-connect
name=mysql-whitelist-timestamp-source
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector tasks.max=10
connection.url=jdbc:mysql://mysql.example.com:3306/my_database?user=alice&passwo
rd=secret
table.whitelist=users,products,transactions
mode=timestamp+incrementing
timestamp.column.name=modified
incrementing.column.name=id
topic.prefix=/kafka-connect:mysql-

Using Custom Queries

   Use a custom query instead of loading tables to join data from multiple
   tables. As long as the query does not include its own filtering, you
   can still use the built-in modes for incremental queries (in this case,
   using a timestamp column).
   Note: This limits you to a single output per connector and because
   there is no table name, the topic “prefix” is actually the full topic
   name in this case.

   The following is an example of a custom query.
   Note: Before running this example, you need to create the stream
   /kafka-connect
name=mysql-whitelist-timestamp-source
        connector.class=io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector
        tasks.max=10
        connection.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres.example.com/test_db?user=bob&p
assword=secret&ssl=true
        query=SELECT users.id,
        users.name,
        transactions.timestamp,
        transactions.user_id,
        transactions.payment FROM users JOIN transactions ON (users.id = transac
tions.user_id)
        mode=timestamp
        timestamp.column.name=timestamp
        topic.prefix=/kafka-connect:mysql-joined-data
