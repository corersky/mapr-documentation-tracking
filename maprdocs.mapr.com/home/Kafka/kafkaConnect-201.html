Kafka Connect 2.0.1 for MapR-ES

   Kafka Connect for MapR-ES is a utility for streaming data between
   MapR-ES and Apache Kafka and other storage systems. This release of
   Kafka Connect is associated with MEP 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x.

   Examples of other systems include:
     * Relational databases
     * Logs and metrics
     * Hadoop and data warehouses
     * NoSQL data stores

   Kafka Connect for MapR-ES makes it easy to integrate all your data via
   Kafka, making it available as realtime streams. For example, you can
   use Kafka Connect for MapR-ES to:
     * Stream changes from a relational database to make events available
       with low latency for stream processing applications.
     * Import realtime logs and metrics into MapR-ES and process them to
       detect anomalies.
     * Implement a process of loading data into MapR-ES from your primary
       data storage systems, performing filtering, transformations, and
       enrichment with a MapR Stream processing framework, and publish the
       data to MapR-FS.

   Note: Built-in security is not available.
