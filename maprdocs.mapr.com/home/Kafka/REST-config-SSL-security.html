SSL Security Configuration

   Describes how to configure Kafka REST security on a MapR cluster.

Secure by Default

   As of MapR 6.0, the MapR Installer performs the Kafka REST
   configuration for new installations. This means that:
     * If MapR core is installed as secure, then Kafka REST is also
       installed as secure.
     * If MapR core is installed as unsecure, then Kafka REST is also
       installed as unsecure.

   Important: In addition, every time the MapR configuration script is run
   with the -R option (configure.sh -R), the default settings for MapR
   core are re-established.

   This means that if you manually configure Kafka REST for unsecure on a
   secure MapR core, Kafka REST will revert back to secure when
   configure.sh -R is run.

Manually Securing Kafka REST Only

   CAUTION:
   This configuration is not a typical configuration.

   If you have an unsecure MapR cluster, and you want to secure Kafka
   REST, do the following:
    1. Obtain the server and client certificates.
       The certificates are obtain by using the keytool:
cd /opt/mapr/conf/ keytool
              -v -exportcert -alias cyber.mapr.cluster -keystore /opt/mapr/conf/
ssl_truststore -rfc -file server.cert
    2. Add any necessary property configurations to the
       kafka-rest.properties configuration file. For example:
listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8082,https://0.0.0.0:8085
ssl.keystore.location=/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore
ssl.keystore.password=<ssl-keystore-password>
ssl.key.password=<ssl-keystore-password>

    3. Restart Kafka REST.
maprcli node services -name kafka-rest -action restart -nodes <space delimited l
ist of nodes>
    4. Run a curl command to ensure that HTTPS is enabled.
curl -X GET https://node1:8085/streams/%2Ftesting/topics --cacert ./server.cert

Manually Unsecuring Kafka REST

   Warning: This scenario is NOT recommended or supported.

   If you have an secure MapR cluster, and you want to unsecure Kafka
   REST, do the following:
    1. In the kafka-rest.properties configuration file, change https:// to
       http:// for the listeners and remove the ssl.* properties. For
       example:
listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8082,http://0.0.0.0:8085
    2. Restart Kafka REST.
maprcli node services -name kafka-rest -action restart -nodes <space delimited l
ist of nodes>
