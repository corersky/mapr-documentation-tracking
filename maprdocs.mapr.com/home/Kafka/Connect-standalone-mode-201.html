Kafka Connect 2.0.1: Configuring in Standalone Mode

   The section describes how to configure and execute workers in
   standalone mode.

   Standalone mode is the simplest mode, where a single process is
   responsible for executing all connectors and tasks. Since it is a
   single process, it requires minimal configuration.

   Configuring and running in standalone mode, involves configuring the
   standalone properties and connector parameters before executing the
   standalone shell command along with the properties files on the command
   line.

   The following parameters must be provided in the
   connect-standalone.properties file.
     * offset.storage.file.filename - Storage for connector offsets which
       are stored on the local file system in standalone mode. Using the
       same file leads to offset data being deleted or overwritten with
       different values.
     * rest.port - Port the REST interface listens on for HTTP requests.
       If you run multiple standalone instances on the same host, this
       parameter must have different values for each instance.

   Note: If you are running multiple standalone instances on the same
   host, these parameters must be different for each instances. Therefore,
   an additional properties file is created for the instance with
   different parameter values.

   To run a worker in standalone mode:
    1. Edit the ./config/connect-standalone.properties file and add the
       name of the local file that will store the connector offsets.
    2. Edit the quickstart-sqlite.properties file (JDBC connector
       configuration file).
    3. Run the ./bin/connect-standalone.sh command along with the
       properties files on the command line.

   For example:
cd /opt/mapr/kafka/kafka-0.9.0
./bin/connect-standalone.sh
./config/connect-standalone.properties
/opt/mapr/kafka-connect-jdbc/kafka-connect-jdbc-2.0.1/etc/kafka-connect-jdbc/qui
ckstart-sqlite.properties

   The first parameter is always a configuration file for the worker. This
   configuration gives you control over settings such as which cluster to
   use and the serialization format. See [1]Kafka Connect 2.0.1: JDBC
   Connector for more information. All additional parameters should be
   connector configuration files. Each file contains a single connector
   configuration.
