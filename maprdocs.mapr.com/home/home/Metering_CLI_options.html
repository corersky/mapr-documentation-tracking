Metering CLI Options

   The following table shows the Metering CLI options:

   CAPTION: Table 1. Metering CLI Options

   Option Description
   --capture Captures the metrics and writes to the configured filesystem.
   --captureAndUpload Captures the metrics and immediately uploads it
   (transmits it to MapR).
   --configure Performs a user interview to determine the metrics output
   location and schedule a cron job.
   --cron [measureOnly] Sets up the cron job with the default cron
   expression from resources/config.properties.

   The measureOnly option sets Metering to only collect metrics and not
   upload.
   --help Displays the Metering CLI help.
   --outputToConsole Writes the output directly to the terminal. In this
   mode, a file is not created.
   --prepareForOfflineSend [destinationDirPath] Zips all unsent metrics
   and sends the file to a zips subdirectory within the configured metrics
   destination directory. If the [destinationDirPath] is provided, the
   zipped metrics will be sent to that directory instead. This option is
   used when sending metrics to MapR from an offline (air-gapped) MapR
   cluster.
   Note: The location of the zip file is displayed on the console.
   --unschedule Removes the cron job set by the Metering CLI.
   --upload Uploads all unsent metrics to MapR's designated metrics
   collection location. Sent metrics are moved to a sent directory within
   the configured metrics destination directory.
