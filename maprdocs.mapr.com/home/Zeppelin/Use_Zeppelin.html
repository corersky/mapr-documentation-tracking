Using Zeppelin to Access Different Backend Engines

   This section contains examples of how to use Apache Zeppelin
   interpreters to access the different backend engines. This includes
   running Apache Pig scripts, Apache Drill queries, Apache Hive queries,
   and Apache Spark jobs, as well as accessing MapR-DB and MapR-ES.
   Note:

   The Data Science Refinery includes the libraries that allow you to
   access MapR-ES through the MapR-ES Java and C APIs. You must run these
   applications inside your container. To log in to your container, follow
   these steps:
    1. Determine your container-id using the output from the following
       command:
docker ps
    2. Log in to your container as the user running the container using
       the container-id:
docker exec -it --user <MAPR_CONTAINER_USER> <container-id> bash -l

   See [1]MapR-ES Java Applications and [2]MapR-ES C Applications for
   details about how to use these APIs.
