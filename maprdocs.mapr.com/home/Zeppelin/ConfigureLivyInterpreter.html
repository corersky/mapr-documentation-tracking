Configuring the Livy Interpreter

   The Livy interpreter provides support for Spark Python, SparkR, Basic
   Spark, and Spark SQL jobs. To use the Livy interpreter for these
   variations of Spark, you must take certain actions, including
   configuring Zeppelin and installing software on your MapR cluster.

   You must also issue your docker run command with the parameters the
   Livy interpreter requires. See the following material for details about
   these parameters:
     * [1]Bridge Networking
     * [2]Pig, Livy, and Spark Interpreters

Spark Python

   The Apache Livy interpreter supports both Python 2.x and Python 3.x.
   You must install them on your MapR cluster to use them through Livy.
   You do not need to install them in your container. If the versions
   installed in your MapR cluster nodes are different from the versions
   included in the container, some functionality may not work.

   To install custom Python packages, see [3]Installing Custom Packages
   for PySpark.
   To use Python 2.x, specify the following in your notebook:
%livy.pyspark

   To use Python 3.x:
%livy.pyspark3

SparkR

   You must install R on your MapR cluster to use Apache SparkR through
   Livy. If the version installed in your cluster is different from the
   version included in the container, some functionality may not work.

   To install custom packages for SparkR, run the R interpreter and
   execute R commands to install the target package. You must install the
   packages on each node where SparkR will execute. This are the nodes
   that contain a YARN NodeManager. By default, the Livy interpreter
   submits Spark jobs in YARN cluster mode.
   The following example installs the data.table and googleVis packages
   using the R interpreter:
sudo R
> install.packages("data.table")
> install.packages("googleVis")

   To verify these installs, run the following code in your Zeppelin UI:
%livy.sparkr

print(packageVersion("data.table"))
print(packageVersion("googleVis"))

   Your output should look similar to the following, depending on your
   package versions:
[1] '1.10.4.3'
[1] '0.6.2'

Spark Jobs

   By default, the Livy interpreter is configured to submit Apache Spark
   jobs in YARN cluster mode.

   To run Spark jobs in parallel, you must modify the Livy interpreter to
   instantiate Per Note:

   You can set scoped to either of the two options.

Hive Tables

   To use Apache Spark SQL with Apache Hive, follow the steps described at
   [4]Integrate Spark-SQL (Spark 2.0.1 and later) with Hive. As described
   on that page, to access Hive tables through Spark, you must make the
   hive-site.xml configuration file from your Hive cluster available to
   Spark running in your Zeppelin container.

   One way to make the file available is through a volume mount when you
   start docker:
    1. Copy the file /opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/conf/hive-site.xml from
       your Hive cluster to the local host on which you are running the
       docker container.
    2. Add a volume mount argument to your docker run command.
       In the following example, the local hive-site.xml file is in /tmp:
docker run -it -p 9995:9995 -e MAPR_CLUSTER=<cluster-name> â€¦ \
-v /tmp/hive-site.xml:/opt/mapr/spark/spark-2.2.0/conf/hive-site.xml:ro \
maprtech/data-science-refinery:v1.2_6.0.1_5.0.0_centos7

   Another way to make the file available is to copy it into your running
   container:
    1. Copy the file /opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/conf/hive-site.xml from
       your Hive cluster to the local host on which you are running the
       docker container.
    2. Determine your container-id using the output from the following
       command:
docker ps
    3. Copy hive-site.xml from your local host into your docker container:
docker cp /tmp/hive-site.xml <container-id>:/opt/mapr/spark/spark-2.2.0/conf
    4. Log in to your container as the user running the container using
       the container-id:
docker exec -it --user <MAPR_CONTAINER_USER> <container-id> bash -l
    5. Restart the Livy service running in your container:
/opt/mapr/livy/livy-<version>/bin/livy-server stop
/opt/mapr/livy/livy-<version>/bin/livy-server start
