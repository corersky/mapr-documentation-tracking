MEP Components and OS Support

   MapR Expansion Packs consist of ecosystem components and
   MapR-monitoring components that can run on a variety of operating
   systems.
   MapR 6.0 and later support multiple MapR Expansion Packs (MEPs). For
   information about the MEPs supported by various MapR core versions, see
   [1]MEP Support by MapR Core Version. For more information about the
   components in each MEP, see the [2]MapR Expansion Pack Release Notes.
