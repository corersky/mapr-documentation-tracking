MapR Expansion Packs

   A MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) provides a set of ecosystem components that
   work together on one or more MapR cluster versions. Only one version of
   each ecosystem component is available in each MEP. For example, only
   one version of Hive and one version of Spark is supported in a MEP.

   MapR creates a new MEP version when a new ecosystem component is
   available or a patch is applied to an ecosystem component that is
   already in a released MEP.

   A single version of MapR core may support multiple MEPs, but only one
   at a time. For a list of currently supported MEPs and detailed
   information about each MEP, see [1]MapR Expansion Packs (MEPs).

MapR Ecosystem Components

   Hadoop ecosystem components within the MEP undergo extensive
   interoperability testing to validate that the components can work
   together. MapR often provides revisions to these components on a
   monthly basis. Examples of Hadoop ecosystem components include Hive,
   Pig, Spark, and Oozie.
   The following open source components are included in the MEP for MapR
   Monitoring use cases, not for third-party use cases:
     * Collectd
     * Elasticsearch
     * Fluentd
     * Grafana
     * Kibana
     * OpenTSDB

   Note: Developer previews for fast-moving ecosystem components will
   continue to be available in addition to MEPs. However, developer
   preview releases of ecosystem components are not tested for production
   environments, and they do not undergo the same interoperability
   testing.

   For more information, see the [2]MapR Expansion Pack Release Notes.
