Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Oozie Services

   The Warden daemon starts the Oozie server automatically at installation
   time. You can start and stop Oozie from the command line or from the
   MapR Control System. Using the maprcli node services command enables
   you to start Oozie on multiple nodes at one time.

   Starting and Stopping Oozie using maprcli

   Complete the following steps to start | stop | restart Oozie from the
   command line:
    1. Make a list of nodes on which Oozie is configured.
    2. Issue the maprcli node services command with either start or stop,
       and specify the nodes on which Oozie is configured, separated by
       spaces.
       Example:
maprcli node services -name oozie -action start -nodes node001 node002 node003
maprcli node services -name oozie -action stop -nodes node001 node002 node003

   For more information, see [1]Managing the Service.
