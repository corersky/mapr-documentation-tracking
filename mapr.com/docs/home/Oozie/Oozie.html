Oozie

   [oozie_logo.png] Apache Oozieâ„¢ is a workflow scheduler system to manage
   Apache Hadoop jobs. Using Oozie, you can set up workflows that execute
   MapReduce applications and coordinators that manage workflows.

   Oozie Workflow jobs are Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs) of actions.
   Oozie Coordinator jobs are recurrent Oozie Workflow jobs triggered by
   time (frequency) and data availability.

   Oozie is integrated with the rest of the Hadoop stack supporting
   several types of Hadoop jobs out of the box (such as Java map-reduce,
   Streaming map-reduce, Pig, Hive, Sqoop and Distcp) as well as system
   specific jobs (such as Java programs and shell scripts).

   This section contains documentation for Oozie on the MapR Converged
   Data Platform and provides all relevant details about using Oozie with
   MapR, but does not duplicate Apache documentation. You can refer also
   to documentation available from the [1]Apache Oozie project.
