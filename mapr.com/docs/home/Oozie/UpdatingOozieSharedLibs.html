Updating the Oozie Shared Libraries

   By default, the Oozie shared libraries are uploaded to the
   maprfs:///oozie/share/lib directory.

   If the oozie.service.WorkflowAppService.system.libpath property in the
   oozie-site.xml file was changed from the default value
   (/oozie/share/lib), you must perform the following steps to update the
   shared libraries:
    1. Run the following command to copy the new Oozie shared libraries to
       MapR file system:{OOZIE_HOME}/bin/oozie-setup.sh sharelib create
       -fs maprfs:/// -locallib /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/share
    2. Run the following command to update the Oozie classpath with the
       new shared libraries:
{OOZIE_HOME}/bin/oozie admin -sharelibupdate
