Updating the Oozie Shared Libraries

   By default, the Oozie shared libraries are uploaded to the
   maprfs:///oozie/share/lib directory.

   If you have not changed the
   oozie.service.WorkflowAppService.system.libpath property in the
   oozie-site.xml file, Oozie will update and upload the shared libraries
   automatically after rebuilding the Oozie war file. Or you can update
   sharelib without rebuilding the war file by using the following steps.

   If the oozie.service.WorkflowAppService.system.libpath property in the
   oozie-site.xml file was changed from the default value
   (/oozie/share/lib), you must perform the following steps to update the
   shared libraries:
    1. Run the following command to copy the new Oozie shared libraries to
       MapR file system:{OOZIE_HOME}/bin/oozie-setup.sh sharelib create
       -fs maprfs:/// -locallib /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/share
    2. Run the following command to update the Oozie classpath with the
       new shared libraries:
{OOZIE_HOME}/bin/oozie admin -sharelibupdate
