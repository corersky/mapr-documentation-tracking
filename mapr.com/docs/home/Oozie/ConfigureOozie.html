Configure Oozie

   The following sections provide information about how to configure
   Oozie:

   To set up Oozie using a non-default administrative user (non-mapr), set
   the yarn.resourcemanager.principal property to the non-mapr user in the
   yarn-site.xml file. For more information, see [1]yarn-site.xml.
   In Oozie 4.3.0, when you modify the yarn-site.xml file on Oozie server
   nodes, you need to rebuild the Oozie war file for including the latest
   changes in the following two methods:
    1. First method:
         a. Rebuild Oozie war files:
<oozie_home>/bin/oozie-setup.sh
 <version>/ <-secure>
         b. Restart Oozie:
maprcli node services -name oozie -action restart
 -nodes <oozie nodes>
    2. Second method:
          + Or, for MEP 4.x, you can also run the following command:
re-run '/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
