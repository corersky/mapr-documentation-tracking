MapR Installer

   This section describes how to download and run the MapR Installer setup
   script, which must be done before you can start the MapR Installer web
   interface or issue MapR Installer Stanza commands.
   The MapR Installer web interface makes the installation of a MapR
   cluster easy. After taking you through the process of selecting
   services and configuring the cluster, the installer installs MapR
   software. You can use the MapR Installer to install:
     * New-feature releases, such as MapR 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 6.0
     * Maintenance releases, such as 5.2.1, 5.2.2, and 6.0.1

   You can also use the MapR Installer to perform upgrades on clusters
   that have a MapR Installer database. MapR Installer Stanzas provide a
   script-based tool that performs the same functions as the MapR
   Installer web interface. For more information about Stanzas, see
   [1]MapR Installer Stanzas.

Setting Up and Running the MapR Installer

   To set up and run the installer, complete the following steps:
    1. Select a node to run the MapR Installer. The node from which you
       run the MapR Installer does not need to be one of the nodes you
       plan to install the cluster on. Before you begin, you may want to
       check the [2]prerequisites and [3]known issues.
    2. Download the mapr-setup.sh script. Choose one of the following
       options:
          + Download the setup script directly from [4]package.mapr.com to
            the node that will run the MapR Installer:
$ wget http://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/mapr-setup.sh -P /tmp
          + Download to your local workstation, and copy to the node that
            will run the MapR Installer:
              a. On the [5]MapR Download Page, click Download, and save
                 the setup script to a location on your workstation.
              b. Use a tool such as SCP to copy the file to the node that
                 will run the MapR Installer:
$ scp mapr-setup.sh user@server /tmp
    3. Change the file permissions so that you can run the file.
$ chmod +x /tmp/mapr-setup.sh
    4. Run the mapr-setup.sh script to configure the node to run the MapR
       Installer. Run the following command as the root user from the
       directory that contains the script. The script prompts you for some
       information. If you have not used this script before, consider
       reviewing [6]Using mapr-setup.sh to be prepared.
$ sudo bash /tmp/mapr-setup.sh
       Note: For examples of options you can use with mapr-setup.sh, see
       [7]Using mapr-setup.sh.
    5. Start the MapR Installer. Open the MapR Installer URL:
https://<Installer Node hostname/IPaddress>:9443
       You will be prompted to log in as the MapR Administrator user that
       you configured while running the mapr-setup.sh script.

Other Tasks You Can Perform with the MapR Installer

   Once the initial installation completes, you can use the same MapR
   Installer URL to upgrade the cluster, apply a patch, or add nodes and
   additional services:
   Use this option . . . To
   Extend Cluster Add a host to an existing cluster.
   Incremental Install Add or upgrade services that are already installed
   on the cluster.
   Maintenance Update Update your cluster to a new patch version of MapR
   Core or apply a patch.
   Version Upgrade Upgrade the cluster to a newer MapR version, apply a
   patch, and upgrade services that are already installed on the cluster.
   Shutdown Stop MapR services on the cluster.
   Uninstall Remove existing MapR software before proceeding with a new
   installation.
   Note: The MapR Installer definitions are updated frequently. [8]Update
   the MapR Installer to get the latest ecosystem components and MapR
   versions.
