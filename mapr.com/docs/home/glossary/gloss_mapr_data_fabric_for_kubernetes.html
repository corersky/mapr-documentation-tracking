MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes

   A set of Docker containers that provide persistent storage for
   Kubernetes objects through the MapR Filesystem. Once the Docker
   containers are installed, both a Kubernetes FlexVolume Driver and a
   Kubernetes Dynamic Volume Provisioner are available for static and
   dynamic provisioning of MapR storage.
