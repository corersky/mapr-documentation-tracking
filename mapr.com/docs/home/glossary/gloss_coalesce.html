coalesce

   The interval of time during which READ, WRITE, or GETATTR operations on
   one file from one IP address or UID are logged only once for a
   particular operation, if auditing is enabled.
   For example, suppose that a client application reads a single file
   three times in 6 minutes, so that there is one read at 0 minutes,
   another at 3 minutes, and a final read at 6 minutes. If the coalesce
   interval is at least 6 minutes, then only the first read operation is
   logged. However, if the interval is between 4 minutes, then only the
   first and third read operations are logged. If the interval is 2
   minutes, all three read operations are logged.

   Now however, if the client was also writing to the file, irrespective
   of the coalesce interval for the read operation in the example stated
   previously, the write operation is logged, as it is a different
   operation from reading.
