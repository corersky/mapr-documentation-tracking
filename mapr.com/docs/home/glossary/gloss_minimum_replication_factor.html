minimum replication factor

   The minimum number of copies of a volume that should be maintained by
   the MapR cluster for normal operation. When the replication factor
   falls below this minimum, re-replication occurs as aggressively as
   possible to restore the replication level. If any containers in the
   CLDB volume fall below the minimum replication factor, writes are
   disabled until aggressive re-replication restores the minimum level of
   replication.
