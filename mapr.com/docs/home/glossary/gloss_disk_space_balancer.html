disk space balancer

   The disk space balancer is a tool that balances disk space usage on a
   cluster by moving containers between storage pools. Whenever a storage
   pool is over 70% full (or a threshold defined by the
   cldb.balancer.disk.threshold.percentage parameter), the disk space
   balancer distributes containers to other storage pools that have lower
   utilization than the average for that cluster. The disk space balancer
   aims to ensure that the percentage of space used on all of the disks in
   the node is similar.
