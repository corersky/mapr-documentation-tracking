chunk

   Files in MapR file system are split into chunks (similar to Hadoop
   blocks) that are normally 256 MB by default. Any multiple of 65,536
   bytes is a valid chunk size, but tuning the size correctly is
   important. Files inherit the chunk size settings of the directory that
   contains them, as do subdirectories on which chunk size has not been
   explicitly set. Any files written by a Hadoop application, whether via
   the file APIs or over NFS, use chunk size specified by the settings for
   the directory where the file is written.
