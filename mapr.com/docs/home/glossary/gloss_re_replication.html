re-replication

   Re-replication occurs whenever the number of available replica
   containers drops below the number prescribed by that volume's
   replication factor. Re-replication may occur for a variety of reasons
   including replica container corruption, node unavailability, hard disk
   failure, or an increase in replication factor.
