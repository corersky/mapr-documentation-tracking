desired replication factor

   The number of copies of a volume that should be maintained by the MapR
   cluster for normal operation. When the number of copies falls below the
   desired replication factor, but remains equal to or above the
   [1]minimum replication factor, re-replication occurs after the timeout
   specified in the cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec parameter.
