data container

   One of the two types of containers in a MapR cluster. Data containers
   typically have a cascaded configuration (master replicates to replica1,
   replica1 replicates to replica2, and so on). Every data container is
   either a master container, an intermediate container, or a tail
   container depending on its replication role.
