Integrate Pig and MapR Database

   To configure Pig to work with MapR Database tables, perform the
   following steps:
    1. On the client node where Pig is installed, add the following string
       to /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh:
export PIG_CLASSPATH=$PIG_CLASSPATH:/location-to-hbase-jar
    2. If the client node where Pig is installed also has the mapr-hbase
       package installed, add the location of the hbase-<version>.jar file
       to the PIG_CLASSPATH variable from the previous step:
export PIG_CLASSPATH="$PIG_CLASSPATH:/opt/mapr/hbase/hbase-<version>/hbase-<vers
ion>.jar"
    3. If the client node where Pig is installed does not have the
       mapr-hbase package installed, copy the HBase JAR from a node that
       does have HBase installed to a location on the Pig client node. Add
       the HBase JAR's location to the definition from previous steps:
export PIG_CLASSPATH=$PIG_CLASSPATH:/opt/mapr/lib/hbase-<version>.jar
    4. Add the HBase JAR to the Hadoop classpath:
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH="/opt/mapr/hbase/hbase-<version>/hbase-<version>-mapr.ja
r:$HADOOP_CLASSPATH"
    5. Launch a Pig job and verify that Pig can access HBase tables by
       using the HBase table name directly. Do not use the hbase://
       prefix.
