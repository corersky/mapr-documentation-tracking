Example: Upload a Text File to MapR-FS and use Pig to Save it as an ORC File

    1. Upload the file to MapR-FS:
cd /home/mapr
sudo -u mapr hadoop fs -put ./test_pig.data /test_pig.data
sudo -u mapr hadoop fs -mkdir /output
    2. Start Pig and save the text file in ORC format:
sudo -u mapr pig
grunt> A = LOAD '/test_pig.data' using PigStorage(',') AS (first_name:chararray,
 last_name:chararray);
grunt> store A into '/output/A' using OrcStorage('');
    3. Verify that the ORC file was created:
hadoop fs -ls /output/A/
