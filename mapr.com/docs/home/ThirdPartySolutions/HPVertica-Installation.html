Install Vertica

   Follow the instructions in the Vertica Installation Guide to install
   Vertica on the selected nodes, and apply your Vertica license using the
   install_vertica script.
   You can find Vertica documentation at [1]www.vertica.com/documentation.
   Warning: For data-intensive workloads, MapR recommends disabling the
   Transparent Huge Pages (THP) feature in the Linux kernel. See
   [2]Preparing each Node - Infrastructure for the disable command.

   If THP is set to always, the Vertica installer will fail with the
   following message:
   Transparent hugepages is set to 'always'. Must be 'never' or 'madvise'.

   To bypass this setting, use the failurethreshold=NONE option in the
   Vertica installer.
