Install MapR

    1. Follow instructions in the MapR [1]Installation Guide to install
       MapR 3.0.2 or 3.1.1, and apply either an Enterprise Edition or
       Enterprise Database Edition license.

   Each MapR node where Vertica will be installed must be running the MapR
   fileserver and nfs services. Other MapR services may also run on
   Vertica nodes but are not required.
    2. From any MapR cluster node, confirm that NFS is running on all
       nodes where Vertica will be installed. To do so, use the following
       command:
maprcli node list -filter "[service==nfs] and [service==fileserver]" -columns se
rvice
