Add Vertica as a MapR Service

   Setting up Vertica as a MapR service reserves memory for Vertica that
   would otherwise be available for Hadoop applications. It also starts
   the Vertica daemon for use by MapR to reserve resources and to monitor
   Vertica node status. Vertica uses admintools for database cluster
   management and related tasks. The MapR MCS management are only
   applicable to the local Vertica service.

   As installed, the vertica_agent service is managed by the Linux init
   mechanism. However, the MapR pluggable services framework provides a
   mechanism for MapR to start the local verticad daemon instead of the
   vertica_agent service.

   On all nodes in the Vertica cluster, repeat the following steps:
    1. As the root user, use chkconfig to prevent the Linux init process
       from starting Vertica’s daemons:
chkconfig vertica_agent off
chkconfig verticad off
    2. As the root user, copy the verticad init script link to the MapR
       initscripts directory:
cp -d /etc/init.d/verticad /opt/mapr/initscripts
    3. Starting Vertica daemons requires root capability. Grant this
       capability to the MapR administrative user with sudo. Using visudo,
       add an entry to the sudoers file. If the MapR administrative user
       is the default “mapr”, add the following entry to /etc/sudoers on
       every node where Vertica will be installed. Alternatively, you can
       add a file to the sudoers.d directory
       (/etc/sudoers.d/maprvertica_conf):
mapr ALL=(root)
NOPASSWD:/opt/mapr/initscripts/vertica_wrapper,/opt/vertica/sbin/verticad
Defaults!/opt/mapr/initscripts/vertica_wrapper !requiretty
Defaults!/opt/vertica/sbin/verticad !requiretty
    4. As the root user, you need to configure the kernel NFS client to
       handle the correct throughput:
echo 8 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
echo 4 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio
echo vm.dirty_ratio=8 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo vm.dirty_background_ratio=4 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
modprobe sunrpc
sysctl -w sunrpc.tcp_slot_table_entries=128
sysctl -w sunrpc.tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128
echo options sunrpc tcp_slot_table_entries=128 >> /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf
echo options sunrpc tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128 >>
/etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf
    5. As the root user, create a one-line script that MapR will use to
       invoke the verticad script on every node where Vertica will run.
       Use any editor to create the /opt/mapr/initscripts/vertica_wrapper,
       as shown in the example below:
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/sudo /opt/mapr/initscripts/verticad $*
exit $?
       You must create this script because the MapR pluggable service
       framework cannot invoke scripts with the sudo command. Make the
       script executable:
chmod +x /opt/mapr/initscripts/vertica_wrapper
    6. As the MapR administrative user, create a MapR warden configuration
       file for the Vertica service. Create the file
       /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.Vertica.conf, creating the parent
       directory if necessary. Include the following entries.
       Warning: The value of the service.heapsize.percent property, which
       allocates 65% of system memory to Vertica, is an example and
       requires further assessment. This setting needs to be properly
       sized based on both Vertica and MapR guidelines.
services=Vertica:all:nfs
service.displayname="Vertica"
service.command.start=/opt/mapr/initscripts/vertica_wrapper start
service.command.stop=/opt/mapr/initscripts/vertica_wrapper stop
service.logs.location=/vertica/data/catalog service.command.type=BACKGROUND
service.command.monitorcommand=/opt/mapr/initscripts/vertica_wrapper status
service.depends.local=1 service.heapsize.percent=65
service.heapsize.min=8000
       Warning: This configuration uses a minimum of 8 GB (shown in MB
       above) of RAM for Vertica (the service.heapsize.min setting). See
       Vertica’s documentation for discussion on required minimum RAM
       settings.
       In MapR 3.0.2, the Dashboard view in the MapR Control System does
       not display properly after creating a service. Contact MapR support
       to get patch 3.0.2.22510.GA-23717 or later.
