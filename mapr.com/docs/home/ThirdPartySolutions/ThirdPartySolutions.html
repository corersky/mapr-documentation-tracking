Third Party Solutions

   MapR works with industry leaders to provide powerful data analysis
   solutions. For more information about our partners, see [1]MapR
   Partners.

   Starting in the 3.1 release of the MapR software, a dependency
   directory exists at $MAPR_HOME/libexp. This directory contains symbolic
   links to JAR files that many third-party and open source components use
   as dependencies. Add this directory to your CLASSPATH environment
   variable to make these JAR files available to those components.
