HP Vertica Analytics Platform

   This document describes the steps required to run the HP Vertica
   Analytics Platform on a MapR Hadoop cluster. It is not an installation
   guide for either product. Rather, it provides the specific
   configuration steps to configure HP Vertica on the MapR solution.

   Like Hadoop, HP Vertica is deployed in a cluster architecture that uses
   a shared-nothing storage model. Each HP Vertica node typically uses a
   local Linux ext3 or ext4 filesystem to store its files. The HP Vertica
   on MapR solution uses local NFS mounts of the MapR file system instead
   of a local Linux filesystem. Using NFS mounts allows HP Vertica and
   Hadoop to run simultaneously on the same set of hosts or systems. MapR
   provides for resource management to control compute resources used by
   Hadoop applications and by HP Vertica. Note that, for best performance,
   HP recommends running HP Vertica on a dedicated server. The integration
   between MapR and HP Vertica provides access to Hadoop applications, but
   may affect your HP Vertica performance.

   All storage on each HP Vertica/MapR node is flexibly allocated to HP
   Vertica or other Hadoop applications as needed. You do not need to
   pre-allocate nodes or storage to HP Vertica or Hadoop applications.

Target Versions

   The HP Vertica and MapR solution has been tested with and is supported
   on the following versions:
     * HP Vertica 7.0.1 and MapR 3.0.2
     * HP Vertica 7.1 and MapR 3.1.1
