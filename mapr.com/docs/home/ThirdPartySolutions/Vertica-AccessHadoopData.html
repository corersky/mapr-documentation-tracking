Vertica Access to Hadoop Data

   In addition to using MapR NFS for Vertica data, catalog, and temporary
   files, MapR NFS can also be used by Vertica to access data that is
   already in the Hadoop cluster.

   For example, the Vertica COPY command can be used to load data from
   Hadoop into Vertica. COPY is typically used by Vertica to load data
   from a Linux file system into Vertica tables. Since MapR NFS makes
   Hadoop files available to Vertica just like local Linux files, the COPY
   command can be used to load data directly from the MapR Hadoop cluster.

   Similarly, an Vertica external table can be created with a reference to
   files in the MapR Hadoop cluster. External tables typically reference
   files in a Linux file system. By referencing Hadoop files via a MapR
   NFS mount, Vertica external tables access Hadoop files directly.
   Vertica can then execute SQL commands on data in the MapR Hadoop
   cluster.

   MapR allows Vertica to access Hadoop data without the use of any
   special Hadoop connectors.
