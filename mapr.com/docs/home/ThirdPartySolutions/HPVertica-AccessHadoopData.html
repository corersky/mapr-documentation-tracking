HP Vertica Access to Hadoop Data

   In addition to using MapR NFS for HP Vertica data, catalog, and
   temporary files, MapR NFS can also be used by HP Vertica to access data
   that is already in the Hadoop cluster.

   For example, the HP Vertica COPY command can be used to load data from
   Hadoop into HP Vertica. COPY is typically used by HP Vertica to load
   data from a Linux file system into HP Vertica tables. Since MapR NFS
   makes Hadoop files available to HP Vertica just like local Linux files,
   the COPY command can be used to load data directly from the MapR Hadoop
   cluster.

   Similarly, an HP Vertica external table can be created with a reference
   to files in the MapR Hadoop cluster. External tables typically
   reference files in a Linux file system. By referencing Hadoop files via
   a MapR NFS mount, HP Vertica external tables access Hadoop files
   directly. HP Vertica can then execute SQL commands on data in the MapR
   Hadoop cluster.

   MapR allows HP Vertica to access Hadoop data without the use of any
   special Hadoop connectors.
