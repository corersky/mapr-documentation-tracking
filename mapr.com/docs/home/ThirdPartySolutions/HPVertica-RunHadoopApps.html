Run HP Vertica and Hadoop Applications

   Now, both HP Vertica and MapR Hadoop are running on the cluster. Load
   and query your HP Vertica database as you would when using standard
   local Linux storage. All HP Vertica data resides in MapR-FS, which is
   now shared with other Hadoop applications running on the cluster.
