Run Vertica and Hadoop Applications

   Now, both Vertica and MapR Hadoop are running on the cluster. Load and
   query your Vertica database as you would when using standard local
   Linux storage. All Vertica data resides in MapR Filesystem, which is
   now shared with other Hadoop applications running on the cluster.
