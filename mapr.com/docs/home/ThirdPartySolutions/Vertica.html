Vertica Analytics Platform

   This document describes the steps required to run the Vertica Analytics
   Platform on a MapR Hadoop cluster. It is not an installation guide for
   either product. Rather, it provides the specific configuration steps to
   configure Vertica on the MapR solution.

   Like Hadoop, Vertica is deployed in a cluster architecture that uses a
   shared-nothing storage model. Each Vertica node typically uses a local
   Linux ext3 or ext4 filesystem to store its files. The Vertica on MapR
   solution uses local NFS mounts of the MapR file system instead of a
   local Linux filesystem. Using NFS mounts allows Vertica and Hadoop to
   run simultaneously on the same set of hosts or systems. MapR provides
   for resource management to control compute resources used by Hadoop
   applications and by Vertica. Note that, for best performance, it is
   recommended to run Vertica on a dedicated server. The integration
   between MapR and Vertica provides access to Hadoop applications, but
   may affect your Vertica performance.

   All storage on each Vertica/MapR node is flexibly allocated to Vertica
   or other Hadoop applications as needed. You do not need to pre-allocate
   nodes or storage to Vertica or Hadoop applications.

Target Versions

   The Vertica and MapR solution has been tested with and is supported on
   the following versions:
     * Vertica 7.0.1 and MapR 3.0.2
     * Vertica 7.1 and MapR 3.1.1
