Stopping the NFS Service

   Before shutting down MapR or the MapR NFS gateway, shut down the
   Vertica database and service.
    1. To shut down the Vertica database, use Vertica Management Console,
       or the stop_db command in Vertica admintools.
    2. Use the maprcli command to stop the Vertica service on all nodes
       where it has been configured.
maprcli node services -filter [csvc=="Vertica"] -name "Vertica" -action stop
