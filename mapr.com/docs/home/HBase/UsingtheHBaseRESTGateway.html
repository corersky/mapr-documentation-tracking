Using the HBase REST Gateway

   HBase REST Gateway includes an API and a service that accepts REST
   requests to connect to MapR Database tables. Starting in version
   0.98.9, the HBase REST Gateway can be installed as a service that is
   managed by Warden. When mapr-hbase-rest is installed, the
   warden.hbase-rest.conf file is added to the /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d
   directory.
   Note: PAM authentication, encryption, and impersonation for HBase REST
   are enabled by default on secure clusters.
