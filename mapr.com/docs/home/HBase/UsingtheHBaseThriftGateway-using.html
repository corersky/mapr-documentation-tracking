Using the HBase Thrift Gateway

   HBase Thrift Gateway includes an API and a service that accepts Thrift
   requests to connect to MapR-DB tables. The HBase Thirft Gateway can be
   installed as a service that is managed by Warden. When mapr-hbasethrift
   is installed, the warden.hbasethrift.conf file is added to the
   /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d directory.
   Note: Built-in security is not available.
