Using the HBase Thrift Gateway

   HBase Thrift Gateway includes an API and a service that accepts Thrift
   requests to connect to MapR Database tables. The HBase Thirft Gateway
   can be installed as a service that is managed by Warden. When
   mapr-hbasethrift is installed, the warden.hbasethrift.conf file is
   added to the /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d directory.
   Note: MapR SASL authentication, encryption, and impersonation for HBase
   Thrift Gateway are enabled by default on secure clusters.
