OpenStack Manila

   The OpenStack Manila provides shared filesystems as a service.
   Developer documentation for OpenStack Manila project is available
   [1]here.

   The MapR manila file system driver enables manila to create and manage
   shares on the MapR file system, which is designed to hold very large
   amounts of data. The driver is a plug-in based on the Shared File
   Systems service and provides high-throughput access to the data on MapR
   Filesystem distributed file system.

   A Shared File Systems service share in this driver is a volume in MapR
   file system. Instances talk directly to the MapR file system storage
   backend via the (mapr-posix) client. To mount a MapR file system
   volume, the MapR POSIX client is required. Access to each share is
   allowed by user and group based access type, which is aligned with MapR
   file system ACEs to support access control for multiple users and
   groups. If user name and group name are the same, the group access type
   will be used by default.
   The MapR manila driver interacts with MapR Filesystem via the REST API.
   The MapR Manila driver is supported on Manila 1.5.0 and 1.8.1. For
   information on installing the:
     * OpenStack Manila, refer to the [2]Installation Tutorial.
     * MapR Manila driver, see [3]MapRFS Native Driver.

   To use the manila shares created by MapR manila driver, you must first
   install and configure the POSIX (loopbacknfs or FUSE-based) client on
   the tenant hosts by following the steps for [4]Setting Up a Tenant.
