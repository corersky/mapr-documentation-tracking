How Clients Connect to the Replica

   When a client connects to the MapR cluster for I/Os, the client is
   directed to the replica with the shortest distance. In order to
   calculate the distance, every client is given a specific path based on
   whether the client is connecting from within the cluster or from
   outside the cluster.

   For clients connecting from outside the cluster, because the topology
   is unknown, MapR defines the path based on the topology configured in
   the CLDB configuration property (cldb.default.node.topology), the
   default rack (which is hardcoded as default-rack), and the client IP
   address. For example, suppose the client IP address is 10.10.10.1 and
   the value for the CLDB configuration property is default_topo. The
   client topology (or path) is: /default_topo/default_rack/10.10.10.1.

   For clients on the cluster, the client node has a known topology and
   the path is built based on that topology, rack, and the client IP
   address. For example, suppose the client IP address is 10.10.10.1 and
   the client node topology is /topo1/rack1, the client path is:
   /topo1/rack1/10.10.10.1.

   Now, let’s suppose the following node topology:

   For the client connecting from outside or within the cluster, the
   replica that the client connects to is calculated based on the client’s
   node topology (or path) and the distance between the nodes on the
   cluster. When trying to find the nearest replica, the system does a
   distance calculation based upon how far away the replica is from the
   MapR client looking for the replica and chooses the replica with the
   shortest topology or least number of hops from the client node. In the
   above example, the client connecting from:
     * Outside the cluster with the path
       /default_topo/default_rack/10.10.10.1 will connect to replica2
     * Within the cluster with the path:
          + /topo1/rack1/10.10.10.1 will connect to replica1
          + /topo1/rack2/10.10.10.2 will connect to replica2
          + /topo1/rack3/10.10.10.3 will connect to replica2
