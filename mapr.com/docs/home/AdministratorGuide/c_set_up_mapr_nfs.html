Managing MapR NFS

   The MapR NFS service lets you access data on a licensed MapR cluster
   via the [1]NFS protocol:
     * Community Edition license: one NFS node allows you to access your
       cluster as a standard POSIX-compliant filesystem.
     * Enterprise Edition or Enterprise Database Edition license: multiple
       NFS servers allow each node to mount its own MapR-FS on NFS enabled
       with VIPs for high availability (HA) and load balancing

   You can mount the MapR cluster via NFS and use standard shell scripting
   to read and write live data in the cluster. NFS access to cluster data
   can be faster than accessing the same data with the hadoop commands. To
   mount the cluster via NFS from a client machine, see [2]Accessing Data
   with NFS.
