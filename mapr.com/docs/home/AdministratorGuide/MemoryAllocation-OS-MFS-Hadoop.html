Allocating Memory for the OS, MapR Filesystem, and Hadoop Services

   Warden allocates memory to the operating system, MapR Filesystem, and
   MapR Hadoop services based on the following parameters:
   Parameter Default OS MapR Filesystem Hadoop Service(s) Description

   service.command.<os|mfs|servicename>.heapsize.percent
   10

   varies
   varies Defines the heap size percentage.
   service.command.<os|mfs|servicename>.heapsize.maxpercent — 85 — Defines
   the heap size maximum percentage

   service.command.<os|mfs|servicename>.heapsize.max
   4000 — 5000 Defines the maximum heap size in MB.
   service.command.<os|mfs|servicename>.heapsize.min 256 512 256 Defines
   the minimum heap size in MB.

   A dash (—) indicates that the cell value is not used or not applicable.

   Memory settings for the operating system and MapR Filesystem are
   configured in the warden.conf file. The warden.conf file is located in
   /opt/mapr/conf. Other services, such as NodeManager and
   ResourceManager, have their own warden.<servicename>.conf file within
   /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d. For more information about the Warden files, see
   [1]warden.conf and [2]warden.<servicename>.conf.

   Note: Warden only allocates resources for MapR Hadoop services
   associated with roles that are installed on the node.
