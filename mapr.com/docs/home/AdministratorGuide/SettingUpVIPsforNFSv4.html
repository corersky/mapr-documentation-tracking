Setting Up VIPs for NFSv4

   You can set up VIPs using the MapR Control System or the CLI.
   Note: The NFSv3 server (mapr-nfsserver) nodes cannot failover to NFSv4
   server (mapr-nfs4server) nodes and vice versa. Ensure that different
   set of VIPs are assigned for NFSv3 and NFSv4 server nodes. When running
   the maprcli virtualip add command to set up VIPs, list the MACs of the
   respective nodes so that the failover works properly (this is necessary
   if both NFSv3 and NFSv4 are going to be set up on the same cluster).
   The MACs should be mutually exclusive as both NFSv3 and NFSv4 servers
   cannot run on the same node.

Adding VIPs Using the MapR Control System

   You can use the MCS to specify a range of virtual IP addresses and
   assign them to the pool of servers that are running the NFS service.
   You can also restrict the assignment of virtual IP addresses to certain
   subnets.

   Before following this procedure, make sure:
     * You have installed NFS on at least three nodes (recommended).
     * You have started the NFS gateway service on the servers to which
       you plan to assign VIPs.

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the [1]NFS4 service information page where
       you can configure VIPs for NFSv4 nodes.
    2. Click Add Virtual IP to display the Add Virtual IP page.
    3. Enter the start of the VIP range in the Starting Virtual IP field.
       MapR distributes the VIPs in this range to the selected network
       interfaces. VIPs are automatically migrated between the network
       interfaces when failures occur.
    4. Enter the end of the VIP range in the Ending Virtual IP field.
       If you are assigning only one VIP, you can leave the field blank.
       MapR distributes the VIPs in this range to the selected network
       interfaces. VIPs are automatically migrated between the network
       interfaces when failures occur.
    5. Enter the Netmask for the VIP range in the Netmask field.
       For example: 255.255.255.0MapR assigns this netmask to the network
       interfaces along with the VIPs.
    6. Specify whether (Yes) or not (No) to assign a particular VIP
       address to a specific server or MAC address. If Yes, enter the MAC
       address for the network interface to be assigned to the listed VIP
       address. The remaining VIP addresses from the same pool are
       assigned randomly.
    7. Select one of the following:
          + Use all network interfaces on all nodes that are running the
            NFS Gateway service to set up VIPs that use all network
            interfaces on all the nodes running the NFS Gateway service.
            If additional NFS Gateway services are started, the network
            interfaces on their nodes will automatically become candidates
            for the VIPs in this range.
          + Select network interfaces to restrict the assignment of
            virtual IP addresses to certain subnets:
            A list of available and selected node names, physical IP
            addresses, and MAC addresses displays. Select from the:
               o Available list and click [rightArrow.png] to move
                 selection to Selected VIPs.
               o Selected list and click [leftArrow.png] to remove from
                 selected list of VIPs.
            See [2]Designating NICs for MapR.
    8. Confirm the actual VIP assignment by clicking Save Changes.
       It might take up to 40 seconds to assign the VIPs. If necessary,
       refresh the page in your browser to view the list of VIPs.

Setting up VIPs for NFSv4 Server from the Command-Line

   Virtual IP addresses (VIPs) allow you to achieve HA with failover when
   the NFS servers use them to connect the your cluster. When configuring
   VIPs for NFSv4 servers, ensure that you select NFSv4 server nodes only.
   MapR does not support failing over between v3 and v4 servers.

   To set up VIPs for NFSv4 server:
    1. Add VIPs to the NFS server nodes in the cluster by running the
       [3]virtualip add command.
       For example:
maprcli virtualip add -service nfs4 -netmask netmask> -virtualip <vip> -macs <ma
c>
       For the complete list of required and optional parameters, see
       [4]virtualip add.
    2. Add hostname for each VIP in the /etc/hosts file.
       Note: Make the changes to the /etc/hosts file on all the nodes in
       the cluster.
    3. Add the principal for each VIP and generate the keytab file. That
       is, repeat this step in the following order for each VIP:
         a. Add the principals for the following:
               o NFS server hostnames in the kerberos server.
               o VIP hostname in the kerberos server.
         b. Generate the keytab file, which contains entries for all the
            NFS server and VIP hostname principals.
    4. Restart rpc.gssd services on all the NFSv4 server nodes.
       To restart, run the following command:
service rpcgssd start
    5. Mount the cluster.
