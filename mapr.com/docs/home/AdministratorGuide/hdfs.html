Copying Data from Apache Hadoop to a MapR Cluster

   You can use the hdfs protocol, webhdfs protocol, or NFS to copy data
   from Apache Hadoop to a MapR cluster.

   The following table provides descriptions of the methods:
   Method Description
   hdfs:// protocol You can use the hadoop distcp command with the hdfs://
   protocol to copy data from an HDFS cluster into a MapR cluster if the
   HDFS cluster and the MapR cluster use the same RPC protocol version.
   For all other scenarios, use the webhdfs:// protocol or NFS gateway to
   copy data to a MapR cluster.
   webhdfs:// protocol You can use the hadoop distcp command with the
   webhdfs:// protocol to copy data from an HDFS cluster into a MapR
   cluster.
   NFS You can mount a MapR cluster to an HDFS cluster via NFS mount and
   then use the hadoop distcp command to copy data between the two
   clusters.
