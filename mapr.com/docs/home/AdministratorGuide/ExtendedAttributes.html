Managing Extended Attributes

   Extended attributes (referred to as xattrs) allow user applications to
   associate additional metadata with a regular file or directory. Unlike
   system-level inode metadata, such as file permissions or modification
   time, extended attributes are not interpreted by the system and are
   instead used by applications to store additional information about an
   inode. Multiple extended attributes can be associated with a single
   inode. The maximum size allowed for an extended attribute is 64 KB.

   An extended attribute is a name-value pair, with a string name and
   binary value. The extended attribute names are prefixed with a
   namespace. For example, an xattr named myXattr in the user namespace
   would be specified as user.myXattr.

Limitations

     * For the five valid namespaces supported by HDFS, MapR supports the
       following:

   Namespace MapR Functionality
   user Commonly used by client applications. Access to these extended
   attributes in the user namespace is controlled by corresponding
   file/directory permissions. For more information, see [1]Permissions
   for Extended Attributes.
   trusted Available to superusers only. Access is denied for all other
   users. The extended attribute is not available through userspace
   methods.
       Note: The namespaces, system, security, and raw, are not supported
       by MapR.
     * Extended attributes cannot be associated with symbolic links. If
       extended attributes are used on symbolic links, they are instead
       applied to the symbolic link target file.
     * The preserve options of commands like cp -px and distcp -px will
       work on extended attributes only in the following cases:
          + With Hadoop commands such as hadoop fs.
          + On FUSE mounted file paths.
       Note: Extended attributes are not supported on NFS file paths.

   will need to set, retrieve, or modify extended attributes.
