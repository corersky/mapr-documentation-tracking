Allocating Memory for Nodes

   When you run configure.sh on a node, warden allocates memory for the
   operating system, mfs service, MapR Hadoop services, and applications
   using the settings in the warden.conf and warden.<servicename>.conf
   file.

   Warden allocates memory to the following components in the following
   order:
    1. Operating system
    2. mfs service
    3. MapR Hadoop services
    4. Applications, such as YARN applications
    5. If the node only runs MapR Filesystem, NFS, and gateway, then 85%
       of all memory is allocated to MapR Filesystem

   Note: In general, modify the settings in the warden files only under
   certain circumstances. If you modify the values in warden.conf or a
   warden.<servicename>.conf file, you must restart warden. Otherwise,
   updated parameters will not be used to allocate resources.
