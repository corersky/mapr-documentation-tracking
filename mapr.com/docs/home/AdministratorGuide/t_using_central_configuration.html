Using Central Configuration

   MapR provides a central location where you can place customized
   configuration files for all the services running on the MapR cluster.
   As a result, you do not have to edit the configuration files on each
   node individually.

   Default configuration files for each service are stored locally under
   /opt/mapr/. You can edit these files to create customized versions of
   the configuration files. To push these changes to other nodes in the
   cluster, copy the customized files to the mapr.configuration volume in
   the MapR Filesystem. When the pullcentralconfig script runs, it
   overwrites the local configuration file in /opt/mapr with the
   customized files on all nodes that the change applies to.

   The mapr.configuration volume is mounted at
   maprfs://var/mapr/configuration.The mapr.configuration volume mount
   location is not configurable and is only used for central
   configuration.

   Complete the following steps to use the Central Configuration
   (pullcentralconfig script) to push a customized configuration file from
   the mapr.configuration volume in MapR Filesystem to nodes in the
   cluster.
    1. Customize a configuration file on any node in the cluster. See
       [1]Listing the Configuration Files for Each Service to determine
       which files you can customize.
    2. Create the directory structure for the configuration file that is
       relative to $MAPR_HOME based on how many nodes the file applies to:

   Scope MapR File System Location
   Use this file on all nodes that use the configuration file unless a
   node-specific file exists in the mapr.configuration volume.
   /var/mapr/configuration/default/<directory path to the configuration
   file>
   Use this file for a specific node.
   /var/mapr/configuration/nodes/<hostname>/<directory path to the
   configuration file>
    3. Copy the customized file to the mapr.configuration volume in the
       directory that you created. For example, to create a directory to
       update the webserver configuration file, which is in
       /opt/mapr/conf, you would create directory path
       /var/mapr/configuration/default/conf and then copy the updated file
       to this directory.
    4. Run the pullcentralconfig script or wait until the script
       acknowledges the update. For more information, see [2]About the
       pullcentralconfig Script.
    5. Restart the services associated with the updated configuration
       files to ensure that the latest version is used for each service.
