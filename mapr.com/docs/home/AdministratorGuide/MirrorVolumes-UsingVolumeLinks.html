Using Volume Links for Read and Write Operations

   When you mirror a volume, read requests to the source volume can be
   served by any of its mirrors on the same cluster via a volume link of
   type mirror. A volume link is similar to a normal volume mount point,
   except that you can specify whether it points to the source volume or
   its mirrors.
     * To write to (and read from) the source volume, mount the source
       volume normally.
       As long as the source volume is mounted below a non-mirrored
       volume, you can read and write to the volume normally via its
       direct mount path. You can also use a volume link of type writeable
       to write directly to the source volume regardless of its mount
       point.
     * To read from the mirrors, use the [1]volume link create command to
       make a volume link (of type mirror) to the source volume.
       Any read requests from the volume link are distributed among the
       volume's mirrors. Since the volume link provides access to the
       mirror volumes, you do not need to mount the mirror volumes.
