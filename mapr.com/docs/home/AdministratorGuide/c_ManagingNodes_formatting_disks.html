Formatting Disks on a Node From the Command-line

   The [1]disksetup script is used to format disks for use by the MapR
   cluster. Create a text file /tmp/disks.txt listing the disks and
   partitions for use by MapR on the node. Each line lists either a single
   disk or all applicable partitions on a single disk. When listing
   multiple partitions on a line, separate by spaces. For example:
/dev/sdb
/dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdc4
/dev/sdd

   Later, when you run [2]disksetup to format the disks, specify the
   disks.txt file. For example:
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup -F /tmp/disks.txt

   Note: The script [3]disksetup removes all data from the specified
   disks. Make sure you specify the disks correctly, and that any data you
   wish to keep has been backed up elsewhere.

   If you are re-using a node that was used previously in another cluster,
   be sure to format the disks to remove any traces of data from the old
   cluster.
   Warning: Run [4]disksetup only after running [5]configure.sh.
