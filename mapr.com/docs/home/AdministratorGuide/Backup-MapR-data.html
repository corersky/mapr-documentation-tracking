Best Practices for Backing Up MapR Information

   To back up configuration information and data from your MapR cluster,
   you must install the appropriate Linux backup client from your backup
   software provider on your servers in your MapR cluster. Your backup
   client user must have the proper file system, and volume permissions.
   For details on how to configure MapR volume permissions see [1]Creating
   Volume-level ACLs and [2]Managing Access Controls.

Backup Configuration Data

   By default, all installation files on the cluster, for each server in
   the cluster, are stored in a single directory on each server in the
   MapR cluster. To ensure that you backup all the configuration files,
   MapR supported applications, as well as log files, back up the
   /opt/mapr directory for all servers in the cluster.

   Note that the /opt/mapr location includes all log files. Log files can
   add a significant amount of data to your backup environment, so
   evaluate if they are needed for your business continuity requirements.
   To backup just the configuration files for the cluster, backup the
   /opt/mapr/conf directory from all servers in the cluster.

Backup Volume Data

   MapRâ€™s recommended way to backup and restore data, is to enable and
   configure snapshots and volume mirroring for your data, to another MapR
   cluster. This step ensures that your business continuity and disaster
   recovery needs are met.

   See the following links for setting up Snapshots, Mirroring, Table and
   Streams replications.
     * Snapshots: [3]Managing Snapshots
     * Mirrors: [4]Mirror Volumes
     * MapR-DB Table Replication: [5]Managing Table Replication
     * MapR-ES Streams Replication: [6]Stream Replication

   If you do not have a secondary cluster to mirror your data, back up
   your volumes by specifying the following path in your Linux backup
   agent: /mapr/cluster_name/ - For example: /mapr/my.cluster.com/.

Performance Considerations When Backing Large Data Sets

   You could run into bandwidth and performance limitations when you only
   specify one path to your MapR cluster, where your data in your volumes
   is stored on only one Linux host agent. The bottleneck can occur due to
   the size of that data you are backing up (large file sizes), or due to
   the number of files you have in your directory structure (millions of
   files in one directory).
   To mitigate performance issues, break up the volumes across multiple
   Linux backup agents, with specific mount paths. For example:
MapR Linux Host 1 (hostname1):
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume1
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume2
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume3
MapR Linux Host 2 (hostname2):
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume4
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume5
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume6

MapR Linux Host 3 (hostname3):
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume7
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume8
          /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume9

Preserve Metadata About the Volumes

   To preserve metadata such as permssions and ACE rules, run a pre-script
   process as the mapr user, in your backup agent. For example in your
   pre-script configuration for your host agent for your cluster, you
   would run:
maprcli volume dump create
        -name volume1 -dumpfile volume1_fulldump1 -e statefile1

   You may need to write a quick bash script to dump the file to a
   location of your choice and ensure that your backup agent is configured
   to backup that directory. For information on creating volume dumps, see
   [7]Create and Maintain Volume Dump File.
