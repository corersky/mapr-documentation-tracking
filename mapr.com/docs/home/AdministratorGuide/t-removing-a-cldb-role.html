Removing a CLDB Role

   The following steps describe how to remove the CLDB role from a node:
    1. If you have only one CLDB node in the cluster, add the CLDB role to
       another node.
       When failover occurs after removal of the CLDB node, the new CLDB
       node becomes the master CLDB.
    2. Issue the following command to stop the CLDB service on the node:
maprcli node services -name cldb -action stop -nodes mapr-<node>
    3. Purge the CLDB package mapr-cldb with the apt-get, yum, or zypper
       commands, depending on your operating system.
    4. Run configure.sh with the -C and -Z options on the node where you
       removed the role.
       Use the -C option to provide the list of CLDB nodes that excludes
       the node where you removed the role and -Z to specify the list of
       ZooKeeper nodes.
    5. Run configure.sh with the -C and -Z options on all other nodes in
       the cluster.
       Use the -C option to provide the list of CLDB nodes that excludes
       the node where you removed the role and -Z to specify the list of
       ZooKeeper nodes.
    6. Start or restart Warden on the node where you removed the CLDB
       role.
    7. Perform a rolling restart of Warden on all other nodes.
