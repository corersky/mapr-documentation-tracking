Setting Up a Hierarchy of Queues

   CapacityScheduler uses a concept called a queue path to configure a
   hierarchy of queues. The queue path is the full path of the queue's
   hierarchy, starting at root. The following example has three top-level
   child-queues a, b, and c and some sub-queues for a and b:

   Queue paths are defined for each level under the root queue. A queue's
   children are defined with the parameter
   yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.queues, where <queue-path> takes
   the form root.<child>, root.<child>.<child>, and so on. For example,
   the queue path to a2 is designated as root.a.a2.
   Warning:

   Children do not inherit properties directly from the parent unless
   otherwise noted.

   The corresponding queue definition block of the capacity-scheduler.xml
   file is shown below.
