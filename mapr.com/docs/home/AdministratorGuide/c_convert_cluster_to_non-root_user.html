Converting a Cluster from Root to Non-Root User from the Command-Line

   You can change a MapR cluster that runs as root to a non-root user. In
   addition to converting the MapR user to a non-root user, you can also
   disable superuser privileges to the cluster for the root user for
   additional security.
   Warning: You must perform these steps on all nodes on a stable cluster.
   Do not perform this procedure concurrently while upgrading packages.
