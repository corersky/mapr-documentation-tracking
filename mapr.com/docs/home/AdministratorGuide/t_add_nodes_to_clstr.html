Adding Nodes to a Cluster

   Describes how to add nodes to a cluster.
   You can add nodes to a cluster using the web-based MapR Installer
   (version 1.6 or later), the MapR Installer Stanzas, or manually. To add
   nodes to your cluster using the MapR Installer or MapR Installer
   Stanzas, see [1]Extending a Cluster by Adding Nodes. Complete the
   following steps to add nodes manually to a cluster:
    1. Prepare all nodes.
       If you do not use the Domain Name System (DNS), ping the new node
       from an existing node and vice versa. Use the host name instead of
       an IP address. If you do not get a response, and if you rule out a
       network problem, a possible fix is to edit the /etc/hosts files of
       all nodes in the cluster. All nodes need to be listed in all
       /etc/hosts files.
    2. Plan which packages to install based on services you want to run on
       the new nodes.
       See [2]Select Services and [3]MapR Repositories and Packages for
       more information.
    3. Install MapR Software.
          + On all new nodes, add the MapR Repository.
          + On each new node, install the planned packages.
       See [4]Step 2: Prepare Packages and Repositories and [5]Step 3:
       Install MapR Service Packages for more information.
    4. Configure all new nodes by running configure.sh.
       If you added a ZooKeeper role to a node, run the following command
       on all nodes with the new ZooKeeper list: configure.sh
       -no-autostart. See [6]configure.sh for more information.
    5. On all new nodes, format disks for use by MapR if you plan to
       re-use a node from another cluster.
       Format the disks from a re-used node to remove data from the old
       cluster.
       Note: All the disks (for use by MapR) on a node must be of the same
       type. That is, all the disks on a node must either be rotational or
       SSDs; node with disks of both types is not supported.
       See [7]Formatting Disks on a Node From the Command-line for more
       information.
    6. If you manually modified configuration files on the existing nodes
       and those changes apply to the new nodes, copy only those changes
       to the respective files on the new nodes.
    7. Perform the following steps if you added the node(s) to a secure
       cluster configured for cross-cluster operations (such as mirroring,
       or replication,).
         a. Copy the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file and
            /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore file from another node to the
            new node(s).
         b. Copy the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file from:
               o A CLDB node if the new node is a CLDB node.
               o A non-CLDB node if the new node is not a CLDB node.
            The /opt/mapr/conf/maprserticket file contains additional
            entry for cross-cluster tickets. See [8]Configuring Secure
            Clusters for Cross-Cluster NFS Access for more information.
    8. Start ZooKeeper on all new nodes that have ZooKeeper installed:
       service mapr-zookeeper start
    9. Start Warden on all new nodes:
       service mapr-warden start
   10. Restart services that you reconfigured.
       Running configure.sh alone does not reconfigure services, such as
       ZooKeeper. Reconfigured services also require a restart. For
       example, restart ZooKeeper on each node, one at a time after
       running configure.sh. Restart the lead ZooKeeper last. Restarting
       ZooKeeper adds the new nodes into the existing ZooKeeper quorum.
       Services that need to connect to CLDB do not always discover a
       newly added CLDB node without restarting warden.
   11. Set up node topology for the new nodes.
   12. On any new nodes running NFS, set up NFS for HA.
