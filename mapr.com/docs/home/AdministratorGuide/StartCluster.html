Starting Up a Cluster

   Complete the following steps to start up a cluster that was previously
   shut down:
    1. If the cluster nodes are not running, start them.
    2. Change to the root user (or use sudo for the following commands).
    3. Start the ZooKeeper on nodes where it is installed.
# service mapr-zookeeper start
    4. On all nodes, start Warden.
# service mapr-warden start
    5. Over a period of time (depending on the cluster size and other
       factors) the cluster comes up automatically. After the CLDB
       restarts, there is a 15-minute delay before replication resumes, in
       order to allow all nodes to register and heartbeat. This delay can
       be configured using the [1]config save command to set the
       cldb.replication.manager.start.mins parameter.
