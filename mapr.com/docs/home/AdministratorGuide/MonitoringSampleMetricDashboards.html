Sample Dashboards in Grafana

   Use the sample dashboards to get familiar with the types of graphs you
   can create. As of MEP 1.1, sample dashboards are available by default
   in Grafana. You can also find sample dashboards on [1]MapR's Community
   Exchange.
   On Grafana's Home Dashboard, click the Home dropdown menu to access the
   following sample dashboards:

   CLDB Dashboard
          The CLDB dashboard provides a high-level view of the MapR
          Cluster. It displays the following information about the
          cluster: number of nodes, status of nodes, number of volumes,
          container information, disk capacity, and the utilization of
          CPU, memory, and disks across the cluster.

   Node Dashboard
          The Node dashboard provides node-specific information. It
          displays the following information for the selected node: CPU,
          memory, network I/O, MapR Filesystem I/O, MapR Database
          operations, and Node Manager metrics. All the metrics are tagged
          with node hostname and the fqdn drop-down menu on the top left
          can be used to switch between nodes.

   Volume Dashboard
          The Volume dashboard provides volume-specific information. It
          displays the following information for the selected volume: raw
          data size, snapshot size, total size (including the snapshot
          size), volume utilization trends, read/write latency, number of
          reads/writes, and read/write throughput. All the metrics are
          tagged with volume name and the VolumeName drop-down menu on the
          top left can be used to switch between volumes.

   Once you select a dashboard, it displays in the recently viewed
   dashboards list on the Home Dashboard.

Troubleshooting Sample Dashboards

   The sample dashboards should display metrics automatically. However,
   with certain MEPs, some manual configuration may be required to view
   sample dashboard metrics.

   Configure the ClusterID in the CLDB dashboard
          When the ClusterID drop-down menu on the CLDB dashboard is set
          to None, you must manually enter the ClusterID. You can
          determine the ClusterID from the Manage Licenses page in the
          MCS. ClusterID is usually an eighteen digit number.

   Configure the Hostname in the Node dashboards
          When the fqdn drop-down menu on the Node dashboard is set to
          None, you must manually enter the hostname for the node that you
          want to view metrics for.

   Configure the Volume in the Volume dashboard
          When the VolumeName drop-down menu on the Volume dashboard is
          set to None, you must manually enter the volume name for the
          volume that you want to view metrics for. The Volumes page in
          the MCS lists the volume names in the format required by the
          field. For example, you can enter mapr.cluster.root in the
          VolumeName drop-down menu.

   Note: The manual configuration must be applied each time you view a
   dashboard.
