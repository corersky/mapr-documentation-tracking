Monitoring Alarms

   On a cluster with an Enterprise Edition or Enterprise Database Edition
   license, MapR raises alarms to alert you to information about the
   cluster:
     * Cluster health, including disk failures
     * Volumes that are under-replicated or over quota
     * Services not running

   You can see any currently raised alarms in the Active Alarms pane and
   the Alarm Summary page of the MapR Control System (click
   [alarmSummary.png] in MCS) or using the [1]alarm list command. For a
   list of all alarms, see the [2]Alarms Reference.
   When you click [alarmSummary.png] , the Alarm Summary page displays all
   active alarms and for each alarm, the All active alarms pane displays
   the following:
   Column Name Column Description
   Severity The severity of the alarm. Value can be:
     * [severeAlarm.png] — Critical
     * [warningAlarm.png] — Warning
     * [infoAlarm.png] — Information

   Status The status of the alarm. Value can be:
     * Active
     * Muted

   Time The date and time stamp from when the alarm was raised.
   Name The name of the alarm.
   Info The notes associated with the alarm, which contains description of
   the alarm and the recommended action to take.
   Entity The entity on which the alarm was raised.
   Type The type of alarm. Value can be:
     * [3]CLUSTER
     * [4]NODE
     * [5]VOLUME
     * [6]USER/GROUP

   You can select the checkbox beside one or more alarms to:
     * [7]Dismiss the alarms
     * [8]Mute the alarms
