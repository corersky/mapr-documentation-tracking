Configuring the MapR-FS State Store

   By default, the Resource Manager stores its state in the MapR-FS.
   However, you can change the values for the following properties related
   to the MapR-FS state store:
     * To configure the URI to the state store location:
       Set the value of yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.uri in
       yarn-site.xml. The value defaults to the ResourceManager volume
       (/var/mapr/cluster/yarn/rm/system).
     * To configure the retry policy used by the state store client to
       connect with MapR-FS:
       Set the value of
       yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.retry-policy-spec in
       yarn-site.xml. The value defaults to (2000,500).
     * To configure the number of completed applicatons retained by the
       state store:
       Set the value of
       yarn.resourcemanager.state-store.max-completed-applications in
       yarn-site.xml. The value defaults to 10000.
