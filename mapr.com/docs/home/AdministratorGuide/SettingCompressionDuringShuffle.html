Setting Compression During Shuffle

   By default, MapReduce uses compression during the Shuffle phase. You
   can use the -Dmapreduce.maprfs.use.compression switch to turn
   compression off during the Shuffle phase of a MapReduce job. For
   example:
hadoop jar xxx.jar -Dmapreduce.maprfs.use.compression=false
