Configure Log Retention

   By default, Elasticsearch indexes 2 days of logs. Based on your
   requirements, you can configure a different retention period for
   Elasticsearch.
   The following cron job runs each day to purge logs based on the
   retention period.
$min $hour * * * $ES_HOME/bin/curator --config $ES_HOME/etc/elasticsearch/curato
r.yml $ES_HOME/etc/elasticsearch/curator_actions/delete_indices.yml >> $ES_HOME/
var/log/elasticsearch/purgeData.log 2>&1 "

Log Retention for Kibana

   Each time you start Kibana, it logs data to its log file. You cannot
   delete the log file while Kibana is running.
   To purge the log files:
    1. Restart Kibana so that a new log file is created.
maprcli node services -name kibana -nodes <kibana hostname/IPaddress> -action re
start
    2. Delete all the old log files (kibana.*.<#>) from the following
       location: /opt/mapr/kibana/kibana-<version>/var/log/kibana/.
