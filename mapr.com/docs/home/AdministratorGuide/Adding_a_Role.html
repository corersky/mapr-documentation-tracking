Adding a Role

   The following steps describe how to add a role to a node.
   Note: Do not use these steps to add the CLDB or ZooKeeper role.
    1. Install the package corresponding to the new role using apt-get,
       yum, or zypper, depending on your platform.
    2. Run configure.sh -R on the node where you added the role.
       If Warden is running, the new service starts automatically.
    3. If you added the Fileserver role, run disksetup to format and
       prepare disks for use as storage.
    4. Issue the following command to restart Warden on the node where you
       installed the role:
% service mapr-warden restart
