Viewing Application Logs

   You can use logs to view the status and analyze the execution of
   applications in a cluster.

   To view the status or to access logs for running applications, you can
   use the user interface associated with the YARN framework.
     * For MapReduce version 2 or non-MapReduce applications, access the
       ResourceManager user interface from the MCS to view the status and
       logs for a particular application.

   For completed applications, the distributed nature of YARN frameworks
   can make analyzing the execution of applications difficult because
   tasks and containers are scattered throughout the cluster. Without
   centralized or aggregated logging, you must manually access all the log
   files for a completed application by merging the log details for a
   particular application across multiple nodes in the cluster. With
   centralized or aggregated logging, you can can access all the logs for
   a completed application in a centralized location. However, the steps
   to access logs for completed applications differ based on the
   configured logging option.
