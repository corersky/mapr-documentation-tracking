ResourceManager Failover Properties

   The following table describes the configuration properties for
   ResourceManager failover:

   CAPTION:

   Property Description
   yarn.resourcemanager.ha.custom-ha-enabled When
   yarn.client.failover-proxy-provider is set to
   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.MapRZKBasedRMFailoverProxyProvider, this
   property must true. The default, set by configure.sh in yarn-site.xml
   when the cluster uses zero configuration failover for the
   ResourceManager, is true.
   yarn.resourcemanager.ha.enabled

   Enables high availability for the ResourceManager. The default, set by
   MapR in the yarn-site.xml, is true.

   This property must be set to true for failover to occur.
   yarn.resourcemanager.ha.automatic-failover.enabled

   When yarn.resourcemanager.ha.enabled is true, this property enables the
   ResourceManager to automatically failover.

   The default, set in yarn-default.xml, is true.
   yarn.resourcemanager.ha.automatic-failover.embedded

   When yarn.resourcemanager.ha.enabled is true, this property enables the
   ResourceManager to use the embedded automatic failover.

   The default, set in yarn-default.xml, is true.
   yarn.resourcemanager.cluster-id

   Specifies the cluster that the ResourceManager belongs to.

   This value is originally set by configure.sh in the yarn-site.xml and
   the value is required for failover to occur.
   yarn.resourcemanager.ha.rm-ids The ResourceManager service ID.
   Configure.sh adds this property to each node with the ResourceManager
   role.
   yarn.resourcemanager.ha.id

   Specifies the serviceID of the ResourceManager on the current node.
   yarn.resourcemanager.zk-address

   Specifies the zookeeper quorum that the ResourceManager belongs to.

   This value is originally set by configure.sh in the yarn-site.xml when
   you configure failover.
   yarn.client.failover-proxy-provider

   Specifies the ResourceManager failover implementation used by clients,
   ApplicationMasters, and NodeManagers.

   configure.sh sets this value based on the type of failover that you
   configure.
     * For automatic or manual failover, configure.sh sets this value to
       org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.ConfiguredRMFailoverProxyProvider
     * For zero configuration failover, configure.sh sets this value to
       org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.MapRZKBasedRMFailoverProxyProvider

   This value is set by configure.sh in yarn-site.xml when you configure
   failover. Otherwise, the default, set in yarn-default.xml is
   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.DefaultFailoverProxyProvider.

   yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.address[.<serviceID>]

   The address of the scheduler interface

   This value, including the serviceID, is set by configure.sh in
   yarn-site.xml when you configure manual or automatic failover.

   For zero configuration failover, this property in not needed unless you
   have configure custom port values. When you specify the custom port
   number, the serviceID is not required.
   yarn.resourcemanager.resource-tracker.address[.<serviceID>]

   The address of the resource tracker interface. ResourceManager listens
   for container requests and heartbeats from the NodeManagers on this
   port.

   This value, including the serviceID, is set by configure.sh in
   yarn-site.xml when you configure manual or automatic failover.

   For zero configuration failover, this property in not needed unless you
   have configure custom port values. When you specify the custom port
   number, the serviceID is not required.
   yarn.resourcemanager.address[.<serviceID>]

   The address of the client interface. The ResourceManager listens for
   client requests on this port.

   This value, including the serviceID, is set by configure.sh in
   yarn-site.xml when you configure manual or automatic failover.

   For zero configuration failover, this property in not needed unless you
   have configure custom port values. When you specify the custom port
   number, the serviceID is not required.
   yarn.resourcemanager.admin.address[.<serviceID>]

   The address of the administrative interface. ResourceManager listens
   for administrative requests from the yarn rmadmin command on this port.

   This value, including the serviceID, is set by configure.sh in
   yarn-site.xml when you configure manual or automatic failover.

   For zero configuration failover, this property in not needed unless you
   have configure custom port values. When you specify the custom port
   number, the serviceID is not required.
   yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address[.<serviceID>]

   The address of the ResourceManager web UI.

   This value, including the serviceID, is set by configure.sh in
   yarn-site.xml when you configure manual or automatic failover.

   For zero configuration failover, this property in not needed unless you
   have configure custom port values. When you specify the custom port
   number, the serviceID is not required.
   yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.https.address[.<serviceID>]

   The address of the secure ResourceManager web UI.

   This value, including the serviceID, is set by configure.sh in
   yarn-site.xml when you configure manual or automatic failover.

   For zero configuration failover, this property in not needed unless you
   have configure custom port values. When you specify the custom port
   number, the serviceID is not required.
   yarn.client.failover-max-attempts

   The max number of times FailoverProxyProvider should attempt failover.

   The default is -1.
   yarn.client.failover-sleep-base-ms

   The sleep base (in milliseconds) to be used for calculating the
   exponential delay between failovers.

   The value defaults to the value set by
   yarn.resourcemanager.connect.retry-interval.ms, which is 30000 ms.
   yarn.client.failover-sleep-max-ms

   The maximum sleep time (in milliseconds) between failovers.

   The value defaults to the value set by
   yarn.resourcemanager.connect.retry-interval.ms, which is 30000 ms.
   yarn.client.failover-retries

   The number of times a client attempts to reconnect to a
   ResourceManager.

   The default, set in yarn-default.xml, is 0 (infinite).
   yarn.client.failover-retries-on-socket-timeouts

   The number of times a client attempts to reconnect to a ResourceManager
   on socket timeouts.

   The default, set in yarn-default.xml, is 0 (infinite).
