Securing the Mountpoint

   POSIX permissions are the only limitation on read access by the MapR
   POSIX client, whether the cluster connected to has security enabled or
   disabled. By securing the mountpoint, you can limit access to a single
   user.

   Complete the following steps to secure the mountpoint:
    1. On the client system, create /mapr/<clustername>:
mkdir â€“p /mapr/<clustername>
    2. Set ownership and permissions:
chown user1:<posix_user> /mapr
chmod 700 /mapr
    3. Mount the cluster:
mount localhost:/mapr/<clustername>  /mapr/<clustername>
       Now only the <posix_user> can access the cluster with the POSIX
       client.
