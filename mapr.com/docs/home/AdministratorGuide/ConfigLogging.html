Configuring Logging

   The service uses standard Log4J configuration to control its logging.
   The log4j.properties file can be found in
   <MAPR_HOME>/filemigrate/filemigrate-1.0.0/conf/ directory. By default,
   INFO logging is enabled. You can edit the file and restart the service
   to change the logging behavior.

   The service logs the key actions related to scanning, uploading files,
   and deleting files at the INFO level in the filemigrate.log file. The
   log file also includes WARN and ERROR messages if there were problems
   preventing the upload of files (for example, AWS S3 was unreachable).
   If additional detail is needed, edit the log4j.properties file to
   increase logging to the DEBUG or TRACE levels in the properties file.
