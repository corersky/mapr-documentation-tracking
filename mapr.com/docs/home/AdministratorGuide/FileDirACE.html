Managing File and Directory ACEs

   File ACE allows you to define access (whitelist and blacklist) to files
   and directories for a combination of users, groups, and roles. If ACEs
   are not set, POSIX mode bits for the file or directory are used to
   grant or deny access to the file or directory.

   When you set ACEs, MapR sets or resets the corresponding POSIX mode
   bits to match the permissions granted through ACEs. For more
   information, see [1]Setting/Modifying File and Directory ACEs.
     * If both ACEs and POSIX mode bits are set, access is granted if
       access is allowed through ACEs or POSIX mode bits.
     * If ACEs are not set, POSIX mode bits are used to grant access.
     * If neither ACEs nor POSIX mode bits are set, access is denied.

   The owner of the file or directory (and mapr and root users) can set,
   modify, and remove ACEs for that file or directory using [2]hadoop mfs
   commands.

File ACEs

   You can set and modify permissions to read, write, and execute files
   using the [3]hadoop mfs command or the [4]Java API. Specifically, the
   following access types are supported.
           Access Type           Description
   Command-Line Java API (Enum)
   -readfile    READFILE       Read a file.
   -writefile   WRITEFILE      Write to a file.
   -executefile EXECUTEFILE    Execute a file.

   For more information, see [5]hadoop mfs and [6]Java API.

Directory ACEs

   You can set the same ACEs on directories as for files. In addition,
   directory ACEs support permissions to list, add child, delete child,
   and lookup directories using [7]hadoop mfs command. Specifically, the
   following access types are supported.
   Access Type Description
   Command-Line Java API (Enum)
   -readfile READFILE Read a file.
   -writefile WRITEFILE Write to a file.
   -executefile EXECUTEFILE Execute a file.
   -readdir READDIR List the contents of a directory. This access is
   required to write and/or execute files in the directory.
   -lookupdir LOOKUPDIR Lookup a file in a directory. This access is
   required to find, read, write, and/or execute files in the directory.
   -addchild ADDCHILD Add a file or subdirectory.
   -deletechild DELETECHILD Delete a file or subdirectory.

   Although you can set both file and directory ACEs on directories, only
   the directory ACEs are used for determining access to the directory.
   The file ACE on the directory is used as the default ACE setting for
   new files under that directory.

   By default, when you set ACEs on a parent directory:
     * Permissions for existing files and subdirectories under that parent
       remain unchanged.
     * New files under that parent inherit the file ACEs and corresponding
       POSIX mode bits of the parent directory, if available. Otherwise,
       new files get the default ACE, the empty string (""), which
       indicates that no one has permissions to read, write, or execute
       the file and POSIX mode bits are set on the file in the traditional
       way.
     * New subdirectories under the parent inherit both the directory and
       file ACEs and corresponding POSIX mode bits from the parent
       directory.

   Note: When accessing files and directories, the ACEs on files have no
   effect on accessing the parent directory.
