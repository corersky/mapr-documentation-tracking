Label-based Scheduling for YARN Applications

   Label-based scheduling provides job placement control on a multi-tenant
   hadoop cluster. Using label-based scheduling, an administrator can
   control exactly which nodes are chosen to run jobs submitted by
   different users and groups. This is useful for data locality and
   multi-tenancy use cases.

   To use label-based scheduling, an administrator assigns node labels in
   a text file, then composes queue labels or job labels based on the node
   labels. When you run jobs, you can place them on specified nodes on a
   per-job basis (using a job label) or at the queue level (using a queue
   label).

   This feature is used in conjunction with schedulers, such as the Fair
   Scheduler or the Capacity Scheduler.
