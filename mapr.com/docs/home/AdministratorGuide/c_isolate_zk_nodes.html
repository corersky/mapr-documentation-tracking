Isolating ZooKeeper Nodes

   For large clusters (100 nodes or more), isolate the ZooKeeper on nodes
   that do not perform any other function. Isolating the ZooKeeper node
   enables the node to perform its functions without competing for
   resources with other processes. Installing a ZooKeeper-only node is
   similar to any typical node installation, but with a specific subset of
   packages.
   Warning: Do not install the FileServer package on an isolated ZooKeeper
   node in order to prevent MapR from using this node for data storage.
