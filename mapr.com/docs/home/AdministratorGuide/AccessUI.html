Accessing the Service UI

   You can access the service UI directly and using the MapR Control
   System.

Accessing the Service UI Using the MapR Control System (from MapR v6.0.1)

     * Log in to the MapR Control System and click Services.
       The list of services installed on the cluster displays.
     * Locate File Migrate service in the list and click File Migrate.
       The login page for the service UI displays.
     * Enter the credentials (username and password) to log in to the page
       and click login.

Accessing the Service UI Directly

   Enter the following URL in your browser (for both secure and unsecure
   clusters):
https://<hostname>:9444/

   To change the port:
    1. Modify the environment variable property that specifies the
       JETTY_PORT (whose default value is 9444) in the
       /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.filemigrate.conf file, as shown in the
       following example:
service.env=JAVA_HEAP=200m,JETTY_PORT=9444
    2. Wait for a few minutes and then restart the service by running the
       following command:
maprcli node services -name filemigrate -nodes <node to restart> -action restart
