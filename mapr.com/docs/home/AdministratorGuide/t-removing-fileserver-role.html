Removing a Fileserver Role

   Removing the fileserver role from a node is more complex than removing
   other roles. The CLDB tracks data precisely on all fileserver nodes,
   and therefore you should direct the cluster CLDB to stop tracking the
   node before removing the fileserver role. For a planned decommissioning
   of a node, use node topologies to migrate data off the node before
   removing the fileserver role. For example, you could move the node out
   of a live /data topology into a /decommissioned topology that has no
   volumes assigned to it, in order to force data off the node. Otherwise,
   some data will be under-replicated as soon as the node is removed.
   Refer to Node Topology.
   Note: The following procedure involves halting all MapR services on the
   node temporarily. If this will disrupt critical services on your
   cluster, such as CLDB, migrate those services to a different node
   first, and then proceed.

   The following steps describe how to remove the fileserver role from a
   node:
    1. Stop the warden, which will halt all MapR services on the node.
       Wait 5 minutes, after which the CLDB will mark the node as
       critical.
    2. Remove the node from the cluster, to direct the CLDB to stop
       tracking this node.
       You can do this in the MapR Control System GUI or with the maprcli
       node remove command.
    3. Remove the fileserver role by deleting the file
       /opt/mapr/roles/fileserver on the node.
    4. Run configure.sh on the node to reconfigure the node without the
       fileserver role.
    5. Issue the following command to restart Warden on the node:
% service mapr-warden restart
    6. Remove any volumes that were stored locally on the node.
       You can do this in the MapR Control System GUI or with the maprcli
       volume remove command.
