Scenario

   In the following example, you have a cluster with eight nodes, and five
   of them (host1, host2, host3, host4, and host5) are running the
   NodeManager service.

   You want to create one customized configuration file (mapred-site.xml)
   that applies to host2 through host5 and assign a different customized
   configuration file to host1.

   Hostname

   Customized Configuration Files

   host1

   /var/mapr/configuration/nodes/host1/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/mapr
   ed-site.xml

   host2

   /var/mapr/configuration/default/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/mapred-s
   ite.xml

   host3

   /var/mapr/configuration/default/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/mapred-s
   ite.xml

   host4

   /var/mapr/configuration/default/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/mapred-s
   ite.xml

   host5

   /var/mapr/configuration/default/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/mapred-s
   ite.xml

   host6

   Not applicable. No customized configuration files are used.

   host7

   Not applicable. No customized configuration files are used.

   host8

   Not applicable. No customized configuration files are used.
   Warning: Do not change the name of the new configuration file - it must
