MapR Process Metrics

   Every 10 seconds, the collectd service uses a MapR plugin to gather the
   following MapR process metrics on each node in the cluster.

   CAPTION:

   Name Description Additional Tag(s)
   mapr.process.context_switch_involuntary The number of involuntary
   context switches for MapR processes. An involuntary context switch
   occurs when a process consumes more CPU time than what it was allocated
   by the kernel. When an involuntary context switch occurs, the kernel
   stops a process to provide resources to another process.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.

   mapr.process.context_switch_voluntary The number of voluntary context
   switches for MapR processes. A voluntary context switch occurs when a
   process does not require the entire CPU time it was allocated by the
   kernel or when a process is suspended. When a voluntary context switch
   occurs, the kernel provides CPU resources to another process.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.

   mapr.process.cpu_percent The percentage of CPU used for MapR processes.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.

   mapr.process.cpu_time.syst The amount of time, measured in seconds,
   that the process has been in kernel mode.
   mapr.process.cpu_time.user The amount of time, measured in seconds,
   that the process has been in user mode
   mapr.process.data The amount memory, in MB, used by the data segments
   of MapR processes.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.

   mapr.process.disk_octets.read The number of bytes read from disk for
   MapR processes.
   mapr.process.disk_octets.write The number of bytes written to disk for
   MapR processes.
   mapr.process.disk_ops.read The number of read operations for MapR
   processes.
   mapr.process.disk_ops.write The number of write operations for MapR
   processes.
   mapr.process.mem_percent The percentage of total system memory (not
   capped by MapR processes) used for MapR processes.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.

   mapr.process.page_faults.majflt The number of major MapR process faults
   that required loading a memory page from disk.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.

   mapr.process.page_faults.minflt The number of minor MapR process faults
   that required loading a memory page from disk.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.

   mapr.process.rss The actual amount of memory, in MB, used by MapR
   processes.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.

   mapr.process.vm The amount of virtual memory, in MB, used by MapR
   processes.
     * process_name: Display values for a specified process. Process
       values: hoststats,mfs,warden,.etc.
