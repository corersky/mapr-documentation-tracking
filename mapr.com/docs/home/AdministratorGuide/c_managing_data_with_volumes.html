Administering Volumes

   This section provide information about how to organize and manage data
   using volumes, a unique feature of MapR clusters.

   MapR provides volumes as a way to organize data and manage cluster
   performance. A volume is a logical unit that allows you to apply
   policies to a set of files, directories, and sub-volumes. You can use
   volumes to enforce disk usage limits, set replication levels, establish
   ownership and accountability, and measure the cost generated by
   different projects or departments. Create a volume for each user,
   department, or project.

   You can mount volumes under other volumes to build a structure that
   reflects the needs of your organization. Sub-volumes are created by
   mounting a volume in a sub-directory of an already mounted volume. This
   establishes a parent-child relationship between the volumes whereas the
   parent volume is mounted in top-level directory and the child volume is
   mounted in the sub-directory. The volume structure defines how data is
   distributed across the nodes in your cluster. Create multiple small
   volumes with shallow paths at the top of your cluster's volume
   hierarchy to spread the load of access requests across the nodes.

   A well-structured volume hierarchy is an essential aspect of your
   cluster's performance. As your cluster grows, keeping your volume
   hierarchy efficient maximizes data availability. Cluster performance is
   negatively affected when a volume structure is not in place.

   The MapR Control System Volumes page under Data contains the following
   tabs:
     * [1]Summary
     * [2]Snapshots
     * [3]User Disk Usage
     * [4]Schedules
