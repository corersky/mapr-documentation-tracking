Accessing Data with NFSv4

   MapR lets you mount the cluster via NFS so that your applications can
   read and write data directly. MapR allows direct file modification and
   multiple concurrent reads and writes via POSIX semantics. With an
   NFS-mounted cluster, you can read and write data directly with standard
   tools, applications, and scripts. For example, you could run a
   MapReduce application that outputs to a CSV file, then import the CSV
   file directly into SQL via NFS.

   MapR uses NFS Ganesha for supporting NFSv4 features. NFS Ganesha is an
   Open Source userspace implementation of the NFS server. The MapR NFSv4,
   running as a userspace process, registers callbacks with NFS Ganesha
   through the File System Abstraction Layer (FSAL), which is a shared
   library (libfsalmapr.so). NFS Ganesha loads and uses this library
   whenever MapR Filesystem is exported/mounted. The FSAL, in turn, uses
   FileClient (libMapRClient.so library) to connect to the cluster.

   The following diagram illustrates how the MapR processes read and write
   operations to the MapR cluster using NFSv4. When the user enters a
   command (such as ls), the NFS client submits the request over TCP to
   the MapR NFSv4 server. The NFS server uses MapR FileClient to perform
   the requested operation on the cluster and returns the response to the
   NFS client over TCP.

   MapR exports each cluster as the directory /mapr/<cluster name> (for
   example, /mapr/my.cluster.com). If you create a mount point with the
   local path /mapr, then Hadoop FS paths and NFS paths to the cluster
   will be the same. This makes it easy to work on the same files via NFS
   and Hadoop. In a multi-cluster setting, the clusters share a single
   namespace, and you can see them all by mounting the top-level /mapr
   directory.

   For NFSv4, MapR also requires alias or pseudo-path, which when
   specified masks the mount path from the NFS client. MapRâ€™s NFSv4 server
   provides a pseudo-file system where only the exported volumes are
   visible. This is especially useful in scenarios where one or more
   volumes in the hierarchy should be hidden and not be visible. For more
   information, see [1]NFSv4 RFC.

Unsupported NFSv4 Features

   MapR does not currently support the following NFSv4.0 features:
     * pNFS
     * Delegations
     * Mandatory locking
     * Lock upgrades and downgrades
     * Deny share
     * Access control lists (ACL)
     * Namespaces
     * Persistent reply cache
     * Data retention
     * Attributes such as time_access, FATTR4_ARCHIVE, FATTR4_FILES_AVAIL,
       FATTR4_FILES_FREE, FATTR4_FILES_TOTAL, FATTR4_FS_LOCATIONS,
       FATTR4_MIMETYPE, FATTR4_QUOTA_AVAIL_HARD, FATTR4_QUOTA_AVAIL_SOFT,
       FATTR4_QUOTA_USED, FATTR4_TIME_BACKUP, and FATTR4_ACL
