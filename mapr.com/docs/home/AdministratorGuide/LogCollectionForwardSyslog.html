Forward Logs to Syslog Server

   You can configure fluentd to send logs to a syslog server in addition
   to Elasticsearch. This topic provides instructions for configuring
   fluentd to send logs to syslog compatible collectors. However, it only
   provides guidelines for the syslog configuration as syslog parameters
   differ by version. Knowledge of how to configure a syslog compatible
   collector is required to complete this configuration.

   Complete the following steps:
    1. Configure fluentd to send logs to the syslog server.
    2. Configure syslog server to accept logs from fluentd.

Step 1: Configure fluentd to send logs to the syslog server

   Complete the following steps on each fluentd node.
    1. Open the fluentd.conf file
       (/opt/mapr/fluentd/fluentd-<version>/etc/fluentd/fluentd.conf).
    2. Remove the # to uncomment the following store section:
 # <store>
# @type remote_syslog
# host 10.10.100.92
# port 51400
# severity debug
# tag fluentd
# </store>
    3. Update the host parameter to the hostname/IP address of the
       receiving syslog server.
    4. Update the port parameter to match the port that the receiving
       syslog server is expecting remote logging information on.
    5. Restart the fluentd service:
maprcli node services -name fluentd -nodes <space separated list of hostname/IPa
ddresses> -action restart
       Note: You can run this command after completing the steps on a node
       or run this command with a list of nodes once you have configured
       each fluentd node.

Step 2: Configure syslog to accept logs from fluentd

   In general, you need to perform the following steps on the syslog
   collection server:
     * Configure syslogd to listen for logs outside of the syslog node.
     * Set up rules for how syslog handles the logs once it receives it.

    1. In /etc/rsyslog.d/listen.conf, comment out the following parameter:
$SystemLogSocketName /run/systemd/journal/syslog
    2. In /etc/rsyslog.conf, uncomment the following properties:
#$ModLoad imudp
#$UDPServerRun 514

    3. In /etc/rsyslog.conf, update the UDPServerRun to a value above 1000
       that matches the port you configured in fluentd.conf. For example:
       Set UDPServerRun to 51400
    4. In /etc/rsyslog.conf, configure rules for handling logs. For
       example, add the following before the RULES section to route
       messages from the fluentd node to a log file named qa-node91.log.
if $fromhost-ip == '10.10.100.91' then /var/log/qa-node91.log
& ~
       Note: In this example, the IP address must match the IP address of
       the fluentd node.
