Setting MapR Filesystem Permissions

   The MapR file system permissions are similar to the POSIX permissions
   model. Each file and directory is associated with a user (the owner)
   and a group. You can set read, write, and execute permissions
   separately for:
     * the owner of the file or directory.
     * members of the group associated with the file or directory.
     * all other users.

   The permissions for a file or directory are called its mode. The mode
   of a file or directory can be expressed in two ways:
     * Text - a string that indicates the presence of the read (r), write
       (w), and execute (x) permission or their absence (-) for the owner,
       group, and other users respectively. Example: rwxr-xr-x
     * Octal - three octal digits (for the owner, group, and other users),
       that use individual bits to represent the three permissions.
       Example: 755

   Both rwxr-xr-x and 755 represent the same mode; the owner has all
   permissions, and the group and other users have read and execute
   permissions only.

   When you [1]access the MapR file system layer over NFS, the file-level
   permissions are controlled through the Linux interface by using the
   chmod (change mode) command or the chown (change owner) command, as
   well as the hadoop fs -chmod and hadoop fs -chown equivalents. For
   example:
chown jsmith /mapr/my.cluster.com/jsmith/fileA
hadoop -fs chown jsmith /mapr/my.cluster.com/jsmith/fileA
chmod 744 /mapr/my.cluster.com/jsmith/fileA
hadoop -fs chmod 744 /mapr/my.cluster.com/jsmith/fileA

   These commands grant a user whose username is jsmith the read, write,
   and execute privileges on fileA.

   Once you set file permissions, authorization checks are performed when
   a file is opened, and on every file access.
   Note: To further protect your data, the MapR file system data cache is
   never included in a file server core dump.
