Metering

   MapR Control System (MCS) includes a metering feature that can be used
   to collect cluster storage and compute usage details for
   consumption-based billing, for actual monthly storage and computations.

Understanding MapR Metering

   The metering feature relies on collecting data for cluster storage and
   compute usage to produce reports. The metering reporting process is
   secure, reliable, and auditable.

   The metrics are collected every 15 minutes and output in JSON format.
   This JSON file is written to /var/mapr/metering/ with READ-ONLY
   permission. For archival and audit purposes, the metering files are
   saved in MapR file system, /var/mapr/metering/zips and
   /var/mapr/metering/sent. It is recommended to keep these files for a
   period of at least 2 years.

   For a description of each metric collected by default, see [1]Metering
   Data Descriptions.

   For install instructions, see [2]Installing Metering.
   Note: If more than one API server is running on your cluster, MCS
   automatically turns on High Availability (HA) for your cluster.
