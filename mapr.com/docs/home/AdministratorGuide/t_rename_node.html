Renaming a Node from the Command-Line

   To rename a node:
    1. Stop Warden on the node. Example:
service mapr-warden stop
    2. If the node is a ZooKeeper node, stop ZooKeeper on the node.
       Example:
service mapr-zookeeper stop
    3. Rename the host:
          + On Red Hat or CentOS, edit the HOSTNAME parameter in the file
            /etc/sysconfig/network and restart the xinetd service or
            reboot the node.
          + On Ubuntu, change the old hostname to the new hostname in the
            /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files.
    4. If the node is a ZooKeeper node or a CLDB node, run [1]configure.sh
       with a list of CLDB and ZooKeeper nodes.
    5. If the node is a ZooKeeper node, start ZooKeeper on the node.
       Example:
service mapr-zookeeper start
    6. Start Warden on the node. Example:
service mapr-warden start

   After you rename a:
     * CLDB or ZooKeeper node, run [2]configure.sh on all the nodes with
       the new hostname to update the mapr-clusters.conf with the new
       hostname. Ensure that there are no duplicate entries in the file.
       Also, verify that the new host is accessible from all the nodes.
     * Node, some local volumes (such as for audit, metrics, etc.) may
       exist with both the old and new hostnames. If you want, you can
       remove the local volumes with the old hostname, use the existing
       local volume path, or remount to new path.
