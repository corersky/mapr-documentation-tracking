Optimizing FIO Performance For FUSE

   This section describes how to optimize the performance of FUSE when
   running the Flexible I/O tester (fio tool).

Performance tips

     * With Linux kernels prior to version 4.8, size extending writes are
       serialized by the kernel, and result in degraded write performance.
       For optimized write performance, ensure that the Linux kernel in
       use, is at least version 4.8.
     * Set the block size appropriately (for example, bs=16M), to maximize
       performance.
     * Set the number of jobs (numjobs) appropriately to maximise
       performance.

   For example, the fio command could be as follows, for optimised
   performance:
fio --ioengine=libaio --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=perftest --filename=perf
ile
        --bs=16m --iodepth=64 --size=4G --rw=write --numjobs=4
