YARN Log Aggregation

   The YARN Log Aggregation option aggregates and moves log files for
   completed applications from the local file system to the MapR
   Filesystem. This allows users to view the entire set of logs for a
   particular application using the HistoryServer UI or by running the
   yarn logs command.

   By default, YARN container logs are not aggregated on the MapR
   Filesystem. Instead, the logs are retained for 3 hours on the local
   file system before they are deleted. To enable YARN log aggregation or
   to edit the configuration of YARN log aggregation, you must edit the
   yarn-site.xml file in the following directory:
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/etc/hadoop/
