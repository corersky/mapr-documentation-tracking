Mounting NFS on a Mac Client

   Use this procedure to mount to the cluster manually from the command
   line:
    1. Open a terminal. For example, you can click on Launchpad > Open
       terminal.
    2. At the command line, enter the following command to become the root
       user:
       sudo bash
    3. List the NFS shares exported on the server. For example:
       showmount -e usa-node01
       Note: If the protocol is v4 only, the showmount command will not
       return the list of exported NFS shares. Instead, to view the export
       list, run the following command:
/opt/mapr/server nfs4mgr list-exports
    4. Set up a mount point for an NFS share. For example:
       sudo mkdir /mapr
    5. Mount the cluster via NFS. For example:
       sudo mount -o hard,nolock usa-node01:/mapr /mapr
    6. List all mounted filesystems to verify that the cluster is mounted.
       For example:
       mount
