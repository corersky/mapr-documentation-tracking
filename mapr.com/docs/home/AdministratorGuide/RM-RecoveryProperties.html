ResourceManager Recovery Properties

   The following table describes the configuration properties for
   ResourceManager recovery:
   Property Description
   yarn.resourcemanager.recovery.enabled

   Enables the Resourcemanager to recovery based on the information in the
   ResourceManager state store.

   The default, set by configure.sh, is true.
   yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-attempts

   The maximum number of application attempts. This is a global setting
   for all ApplicationMaster nodes.

   You can configure an individual maximum number of application attempts
   for each ApplicationMaster node, but this property sets a global upper
   bound that overrides the individual node configuration.

   The default, set in yarn-default.xml, is 2.

   mapreduce.am.max-attempts
   The maximum number of MapReduce application attempts. If this value is
   larger than the value set by the ResourceManager, the ResourceManager
   value will override this value. The default number is set to 2, to
   allow at least one retry for AM. This property is set in
   mapred-default.xml.
   yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.uri

   URI pointing to the location of the FileSystem path where the
   ResourceManager state is stored.

   The default value is configured to the path for the ResourceManager
   volume (/var/mapr/cluster/yarn/rm/system).

   If the FileSystem name is not provided, the system uses the value
   specified in the fs.default.name specified in the core-site.xml file.
   yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.retry-policy-spec

   Specifies the retry policy for the MapR Filesystem client.

   This policy is specified in pairs of values for the sleep time, in
   milliseconds, and number of retries.

   Each pair is enclosed in parentheses, such as (1000,20), (2000,30).

   The previous example sleeps for 1000 milliseconds for twenty retries,
   then thirty more retries 2000 milliseconds apart.

   The default, set in yarn-default.xml, is (2000,500).
   yarn.resourcemanager.store.class

   The class name of the state-store to be used for saving
   application/attempt state and the credentials.

   The available state-store implementations are
   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore,
   a ZooKeeper based state-store implementation, and
   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.FileSystemRMStat
   eStore, a state-store implementation based on MapR Filesystem.

   The default, yarn-default.xml, is
   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.FileSystemRMStat
   eStore.
   yarn.resourcemanager.state-store.max-completed-applications

   The maximum number of completed applications that the state store
   retains, which is a number less than or equal to
   ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}.

   The default value is 10000. This setting ensures that the applications
   kept in the state store are consistent with the applications in
   ResourceManager memory.

   Any value larger than
   ${yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications} is reset to the
   default.

   The value of this property affects ResourceManager recovery
   performance.Typically, a smaller value optimizes performance for
   recovery.
   yarn.resourcemanager.zk-address

   A comma-separated list of Host:Port pairs. Each corresponds to a
   ZooKeeper server, such as 127.0.0.1:5181,127.0.0.1:5181,127.0.0.1:5181.

   These hosts are used by the ResourceManager to store state.
   yarn.resourcemanager.zk-state-store.parent-path The full path of the
   root znode where ResourceManager state is stored. The default value
   is/rmstore.
   yarn.resourcemanager.zk-num-retries

   Number of times the ResourceManager tries to connect to the ZooKeeper
   server when the connection is lost.

   The default value is 500.
   yarn.resourcemanager.zk-retry-interval-ms The interval between retries,
   in milliseconds, when connecting to a ZooKeeper server. The default
   value is 2000.
   yarn.resourcemanager.zk-timeout-ms

   The ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. The ZooKeeper server
   uses this configuration to determine session expiration.

   Sessions expire when the server does not receive a heartbeat from the
   client within the session timeout period. The default value is 10000.
   yarn.resourcemanager.zk-acl ACLs that set permissions on ZooKeeper
   znodes. The default value is world:anyone:rwcda
