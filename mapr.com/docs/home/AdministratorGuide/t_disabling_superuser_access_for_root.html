Disabling Superuser Access for the Root User from the Command-Line

   Note: Enabling the cldb.squash.root or cldb.reject.root configuration
   values can cause instability with ecosystem open source components if
   they are running as root. [On MapR clusters, services are running as
   the admin cluster user, which is mapr (by default).] Root squash
   applies to only files, not tables or streams. Ensure that root is not
   running any services before performing this procedure.
    1. To disable root user (UID 0) access to the MapR file system on a
       cluster that is running as a non-root user, use either of the
       following commands:
          + The squash root configuration value treats all requests from
            UID 0 as coming from UID -2 (nobody):
# maprcli config save -values {"cldb.squash.root":"1"}
          + The reject root configuration value automatically fails all
            filesystem requests from UID 0:
# maprcli config save -values {"cldb.reject.root":"1"}
    2. You can verify that these commands worked, as shown in the example
       below.
# maprcli config load -keys cldb.squash.root,cldb.reject.root
cldb.reject.root cldb.squash.root
