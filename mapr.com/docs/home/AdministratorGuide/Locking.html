Locking Support in MapR

   MapR Filesystem does not support server-side locking. This means that
   locks are held by components outside of the file system layer and hence
   not shared or enforced globally. As a result, when locking is
   available, you will need to carefully understand exactly where this
   enforcement occurs and ensure that all programs using the same locks
   access them through the same enforcement point. Also, locks, when
   supported in MapR, are always whole file locks and advisory, not
   mandatory. The following table describes the locking support in MapR
   for the clients.

   CAPTION:

   Client Type Locking Support Default Value Notes
   Hadoop No N/A Hadoop does not support locking APIs.
   FUSE-based POSIX Yes Lock MapR supports advisory locking using kernel
   locking. This lock is locally enforced on that single Linux host and
   not shared with other hosts. The lock is only meaningful if all users
   accessing the file are using FUSE and are on the same host.
   Loopback NFS POSIX No N/A No support in MapR for locking. However, you
   can use Network Lock Manager to lock with the nolock option on the
   mount command. This lock is locally enforced on that single Linux host
   and not shared with other hosts. The lock is only meaningful if all
   lock users are using loopbacknfs and are on the same host.
   NFSv3 No N/A No support for locking in MapR. However, you can use
   Network Lock Manager to lock with the nolock option on the mount
   command. This lock is locally enforced on that single Linux host and
   not shared with other hosts. The lock is only meaningful if all lock
   users are using NFSv3 and are on the same host.
   NFSv4 Yes NoLock MapR supports advisory locking for NFSv4 server. This
   is locally enforced on NFSv4 server, which means the lock is only
   meaningful if all lock users are using the same NFSv4 server. See
   [1]Advisory Locking in NFSv4 for more information.
