Recommended Settings for Planned Shutdown

   The MapR stack improves the latencies for planned shutdowns by
   implementing a fast failover mechanism where different services respond
   to the intimation of a failure.

Notifying CLDB to Allow Fast Failover

   When planning to shutdown a node, notifying CLDB of an impending
   shutdown allows CLDB to update the replication chain such that master
   and intermediate containers, if any, are not on the node and re-assign
   VIPs on the node when the node actually goes down. This, in turn,
   allows clients to continue activities on available nodes.

   MapR (v5.1) includes an argument, [1]node failover, to the [2]maprcli
   command that notifies CLDB of impending node shutdown so that CLDB can
   ensure that the specified node does not have any master containers and
   intermediate containers (in a cascaded chain), and VIPs are
   re-assigned.

Shutting Down a Node

   To notify CLDB of a planned shutdown of a node:
    1. Enable the fast failover behavior.
       Refer to [3]Enabling Fast Failover for more information.
    2. Reset the value of tcp_syn_retries parameter.
       Refer to [4]Tuning TCP for more information.
    3. (Optional) Get the hostname of the node to put in maintenance mode
       by running the following command:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli node list -columns hostname
    4. Run the failover command for that node.
       For example:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli node failover -nodes <node-hostname>
       Wait for few minutes (to allow containers to failover) before
       proceeding to the next step.
    5. Stop warden on that node by running the following command:
service mapr-warden stop
    6. Notify MapR that the node is in maintenance mode and when the
       maintenance task is complete, remove the node from maintenance
       mode.
       See [5]Performing Maintenance on a Node for the commands to run to
       [6]put and [7]take a node out of maintenance mode.

   Warning: Shut down only one node at a time. Do not take down multiple
   nodes for maintenance at the same time.
