Managing the FUSE-Based POSIX Client

   This section describes how to start and manage the POSIX client.

Starting and Stopping the POSIX Client

   To ensure that the service can be started and stopped and to run the
   help option, set the shared LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
   Update the shared library environment variable to include the paths to
   the following:
     * Full path to the directory containing libjvm.so file
     * $MAPR_HOME/lib (that is, /opt/mapr/lib directory)

   For example:
Export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.79.x86_64/jre/lib/a
md64/server/:/opt/mapr/lib

   To allow a non-root user to start this service, as administrator or
   root user, run the following command:
chmod u+s /opt/mapr/bin/fusermount

   Verify that permissions have been set for non-root user to start the
   service. For example:
ll /opt/mapr/bin/fusermount

   Your output should look similar to the following:
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 39704 Feb 16 19:41 /opt/mapr/bin/fusermount

   Ensure that the non-root user has full permissions on the mount point
   and log files.

   To manually start or stop the service:
service mapr-posix-client-* [start|stop|status]

   When you run the command, replace * with basic or platinum, which
   corresponds with the package that is installed on the system.
   Note: The POSIX client service cannot be stopped or restarted if any
   other process is accessing the mount point. With systemd (on CentOS/RH
   7.x and Suse 12), the service will enter failed state (if you tried to
   stop) or activating state (if you tried to restart) and you must
   manually kill the client processes.

Running the POSIX Client in Secure Mode

   The POSIX client reads the mapr-clusters.conf file to determine whether
   the process must start in secure or non-secure mode. If security is
   configured, the servicewithimpersonation ticket file must be present in
   the default /tmp directory. If the ticket file is not in the default
   /tmp directory, specify the location of the ticket file using the
   fuse.ticketfile.location configuration parameter in the fuse.conf file
   Tip: See also: [1]Enabling Impersonation for the MapR Superuser and
   [2]Enabling Impersonation for any User.

   If the ticket expires after a connection has been established between
   the POSIX client and the cluster, the connection can stay alive for up
   to an hour. No new connections will be allowed. If the ticket was
   blacklisted, restart POSIX client to refresh the ticket.

Setting up a Ticket for the POSIX Client

   The POSIX client can be accessed using user and service tickets. The
   service tickets have long lifetimes, by default, for ease of
   administration. This is useful for running application processes that
   should not be bounded by the CLDB duration
   (cldb.security.user.ticket.duration.seconds) and renewal
   (cldb.security.user.ticket.max.duration.seconds) properties, which
   limit the lifetime of user tickets. If you plan to use a user ticket,
   ensure that the user has read permissions on the ticket file.

   Irrespective of the ticket type, after generating the ticket, set the
   fuse.ticketfile.location parameter value in the fuse.conf file to point
   to the ticket file to use.

   For more information, see:
     * [3]Generating a MapR User Ticket
     * [4]Generating a Service Ticket

   Note: If the UID/GID in the ticket (without impersonation capability)
   is different from the UID/GID of the logged-in user, all operations are
   performed using the UID/GID of the ticket and not that of the logged-in
   user.

Mounting the MapR Filesystem

   To mount MapR file system at the mount point specified in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/fuse.conf file, create the mountpoint specified in the
   fuse.conf file and start the service. For example:
mkdir /mapr
service mapr-posix-client-* start

   Note: When you run the command, replace * with basic or platinum, which
   corresponds with the package that is installed on the system.

   See also: [5]Enabling Soft Mount and Setting the Timeout

Monitoring the POSIX Client

   To determine whether the POSIX client is running, run the following
   command:
service mapr-posix-client-* status

   Note: When you run the command, replace * with basic or platinum, which
   corresponds with the package that is installed on the system.

Adding and Removing Users

   Before you add and/or remove users using the POSIX client, make a note
   of the following:
     * Invalid UID/GID cannot perform operations on the system.
     * When you add or remove users, it may take up to 30 minutes for the
       changes to take effect.

   By default, the UID cache will expire in 30 minutes. To disable UID
   cache, set the value (in seconds) for fs.mapr.uid.cache.timeout.seconds
   parameter in the core-site.xml file. You can set the value to:
     * 0 to fetch the GID information from the idstore directly
     * >0 to specify the amount of time to keep the UID information in
       cache

   For example, your core-site.xml entry would look similar to the
   following for:
     * Disabling cache:
<property>
   <name>fs.mapr.uid.cache.timeout.seconds</name>
   <value>0</value>
   <description>disable UID cache</description>
</property>
     * Setting 3 minutes as the amount of time to keep the UID information
       in cache:
<property>
   <name>fs.mapr.uid.cache.timeout.seconds</name>
   <value>180</value>
   <description>UID cached for 3 minutes</description>
</property>

Registering POSIX Client with Additional Clusters

   To register the POSIX client with additional clusters, you must add
   entries directly to the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file. The
   clusters will be visible after few minutes.
   Note: Each client supports up to 16 clusters.

Configuring the Chunk Size

   By default, sharding takes effect only if chunk size is >0 and <=2MB.
   To increase the upper limit (up to 256MB) on the chunk size, set the
   value (in bytes) for the fs.mapr.fuseshard.chunksize configuration
   field in the [6]core-site.xml file. For example:
<property>
  <name>fs.mapr.fuseshard.chunksize</name>
  <value>2097152</value>
  <description>setting chunk size</description>
</property>

   Definining File/Directory Compression and Chunk Size
          Each directory in MapR storage contains a hidden file called
          .dfs_attributes that controls compression and chunk size. To
          change these attributes, change the corresponding values in the
          file. For more information, see [7].dfs_attributes.

Unmounting the FUSE Mount

   To unmount the mountpoint andkill the FUSE process, run the following
   command:
service mapr-posix-client-* stop

   Note: When you run the command, replace * with basic or platinum, which
   corresponds with the package that is installed on the system.
