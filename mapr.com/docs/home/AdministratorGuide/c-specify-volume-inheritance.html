Specifying Volume Inheritance Using the CLI

   Volumes can be mounted via the web console, the maprcli commands
   (volume create or volume mount), or the REST commands. If the mount
   point is specified while creating a volume, new volumes can inherit
   properties from the parent volume. Mirror volumes can also inherit
   properties from source volume of the mirror.
   Note: Volume inheritance is a convenience that can only be used during
   volume creation.

   The maprcli volume modify command can be used to change the volume
   inheritance settings of a volume. That is, you can toggle the flag
   (associated with allowgrant) that indicates whether a volume, as a
   parent volume, wants its properties to be inherited by default or not.
   When creating and mounting a volume, the location of the mount point
   can be specified using the path parameter. The volume that is last in
   the path parameter is referred to as the parent volume. (The parent
   volume is the volume on which the volume link is created.)

Inheritance

   The following table shows the list of inheritable parameters that are
   (Yes) and are not (No) inherited by a:
     * Mirror volume from the source volume on the same cluster
     * Mirror volume from the source volume on a different cluster

   Note: All (non-mirror) volumes inherit all the inheritable properties
   from the parent volume. For more information on the properties, refer
   to volume create [1]parameters.
   Inheritable Properties (which are inherited by non-mirror volumes by
   default) Inherited by Mirror Volume on the same cluster as the source
   volume? Inherited by Mirror Volume on a different cluster from the
   source volume?
