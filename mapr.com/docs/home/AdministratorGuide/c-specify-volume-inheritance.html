Specifying Volume Inheritance Using the CLI

   Lists volume properties that can be inherited from other volumes

   Volumes can be mounted using the web console, the maprcli commands
   (volume create or volume mount), or the REST commands. If the mount
   point is specified while creating a volume, new volumes can inherit
   properties from the parent volume. Mirror volumes can also inherit
   properties from the source volume of the mirror.

   Volume inheritance is a convenience that can only be used during volume
   creation.

   The maprcli volume modify command can be used to change the volume
   inheritance settings of a volume. That is, you can toggle the flag
   (associated with allowgrant) that indicates whether a volume, as a
   parent volume, wants its properties to be inherited by default or not.
   When creating and mounting a volume, the location of the mount point
   can be specified using the path parameter. The volume that is last in
   the path parameter is referred to as the parent volume. (The parent
   volume is the volume on which the volume link is created.)

   Inheritance applies during volume creation only. If the settings in the
   parent volume is modified after the child volumes are created, these
   modified properties do not propagate to the child volumes.

Inheritance

   The following table shows the list of inheritable parameters that are
   (Yes) and are not (No) inherited by a:
     * Mirror volume from the source volume on the same cluster
     * Mirror volume from the source volume on a different cluster

   Note: All (non-mirror) volumes inherit all the inheritable properties
   from the parent volume. For more information on the properties, refer
   to volume create [1]parameters.

   CAPTION:

   Inheritable Properties (which are inherited by non-mirror volumes by
   default) Inherited by Mirror Volume on the same cluster as the source
   volume? Inherited by Mirror Volume on a different cluster from the
   source volume?

     * ^1 If destination cluster is also enabled for data-at-rest
       encryption, dare setting is inherited by the mirror volume on the
       destination cluster.
     * ^2 If destination cluster is not enabled for data-at-rest
       encryption, dare setting is not inherited by the mirror volume on
       the destination cluster.
     * ^3 If schedule keyword is specified with the skipinherit parameter,
       schedule(s) are not inherited while inheriting volume properties
       from the source volume.
     * ^4 If tiername keyword is specified with the skipinherit parameter:
          + The tiering properties are not inherited by the mirror volume
            while inheriting volume properties from the tiering-enabled
            source volume.
          + For volumes enabled for warm-tier, the backend erasure-coded
            volume is not created.
