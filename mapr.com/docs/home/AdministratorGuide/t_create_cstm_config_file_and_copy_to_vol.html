Step 1. Create a customized configuration file and copy it to a volume

   Complete the following steps to create a customized configuration file
   for host2 through host5 and copy it to the mapr.configuration volume:
    1. Make a copy of the existing default version of the mapred-site.xml
       file (so you can use it as a template), and store it in /tmp. You
       can perform this step on any node in the cluster that contains the
       configuration file.
cp /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml /tmp/mapred-site.xml
    2. Edit the copy and put in the changes you want for host2 through
       host5.
    3. Create the directories required to store the file under
       /var/mapr/configuration/default.
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /var/mapr/configuration/default/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hado
op
    4. Store the new configuration file in the
       /var/mapr/configuration/default directory.
hadoop fs -put /tmp/mapred-site.xml /var/mapr/configuration/default/hadoop/hadoo
p-2.7.0/etc/hadoop
