Changing Queue Configuration

   You can change queue properties and add new queues by editing
   capacity-scheduler.xml. Make sure that the updated queue configuration
   is valid and that the queue-capacity at each level equals 100%.

   For the changes to take effect, run the following command:
yarn rmadmin -refreshQueues

   Warning:

   Queues cannot be deleted, only added.
