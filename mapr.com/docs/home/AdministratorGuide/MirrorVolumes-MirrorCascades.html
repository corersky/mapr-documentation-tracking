Mirror Cascades

   In a cascade, one mirror synchronizes to the source volume, and each
   successive mirror uses a previous mirror as its source. Mirror cascades
   are useful for propagating data over a distance, then re-propagating
   the data locally instead of transferring the same data remotely again
   for each copy of the mirror. In the example below, the < character
   indicates a mirror's source:
/ < mirror1 < mirror2 < mirror3

   A mirror cascade makes more efficient use of your cluster's network
   bandwidth, but synchronization can be slower to propagate through the
   chain. For cases where synchronization of mirrors is a higher priority
   than network bandwidth optimization, make each mirror read directly
   from the source volume:
mirror1 >   < mirror2
          /
mirror3 >   < mirror4

   You can:
     * Create a mirror cascade by setting the source volume of each mirror
       in the Properties tab of the MapR Control System when creating a
       mirror volume.
     * Break a mirror cascade made from existing mirror volumes by
       changing the source volume of each mirror in the Properties tab of
       the MapR Control System when editing the mirror volume.
