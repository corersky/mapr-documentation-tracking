Understanding Replication

   Volumes are stored as pieces called containers that contain files,
   directories, and other data. By default, the maximum container size is
   32 GB. The maximum container size is set by the cldb.container.sizemb
   parameter (see the [1]config commands). Containers are replicated to
   protect data. Normally, each container has three copies stored on
   separate nodes to provide uninterrupted access to all data, even if a
   node fails.

   For each volume, you can specify a desired and minimum data replication
   factor and a desired and minimum namespace (name container) replication
   factor.

   When enabled, the CLDB manages the namespace container replication
   separate from the data container replication. This capability is used
   when you have low volume replication but want to have higher namespace
   replication.
   Note: The namespace container parameters, nsreplication or
   nsminreplication must be the same or larger than the equivalent data
   replication parameter, replication or minreplication.

     * The replication factor is the number of replicated copies you want
       for normal operation and data protection. When the number of copies
       falls below the desired replication factor, but remains equal to or
       above the minimum replication factor, the CLDB actively creates
       additional copies of the container while trying to minimize the
       impact of making an additional copy of the container.
       Re-replication occurs after the timeout specified in the
       cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec parameter (configurable using the
       config API). The minimum replication factor is 1 and the maximum is
       6 (default: 3).
     * The minimum replication factor is the smallest number of copies you
       want in order to adequately protect against data loss. When the
       replication factor falls below this minimum, re-replication occurs
       aggressively if data is being actively written to the container. If
       enforceminreplicationforio property is set to true, writes succeed
       only when the minimum replication factor requirements are met. If
       property is set to true and minimum number of copies are not
       available, the client is asked to retry. In the case of a:
          + Hard mount, the client might try for up to 10 mins and then
            return an error
          + Soft mount, the client might return an error
       The minimum replication factor is 1 and the maximum is 6 (default:
       2). In all cases, the minimum replication factor cannot be greater
       than the replication factor. When you increase the minimum
       replication factor, if enforceminreplicationforio property
       (configurable at the volume level) is set to true, the minimum
       number of copies requirement will not be enforced during writes
       until new copies of all containers associated with the volume are
       created.

     * The namespace replication factor is the number of namespace
       container replicated copies you want for normal operation and data
       protection. When the number of copies falls below the desired
       replication factor, but remains equal to or above the minimum
       replication factor, the CLDB actively creates additional copies of
       the container while trying to minimize the impact of making an
       additional copy of the container. Re-replication occurs after the
       timeout specified in the cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec parameter
       (configurable using the config API). The minimum replication factor
       is 1 and the maximum is 6 (default: 3).
     * The minimum namespace replication factor is the minimum number of
       namespace container replicated copies you want in order to
       adequately protect against data loss. When the replication factor
       falls below this minimum, re-replication occurs aggressively if
       data is being actively written to the container. If
       enforcemineplicationforio property (configurable at the volume
       level) is set to true, writes succeed only when the minimum
       replication factor requirements are met. If property is set to true
       and minimum number of copies are not available, the client is asked
       to retry. In the case of a:
          + Hard mount, the client might try for up to 10 mins and then
            return an error
          + Soft mount, the client might return an error
       The system will not wait for lost replicas to become available
       again. The minimum replication factor is 1 and the maximum is 6
       (default: 2). In all cases, the minimum replication factor cannot
       be greater than the replication factor. When you increase the
       minimum replication factor, if enforceminreplicationforio property
       is set to true, the presence of the minimum number of copies will
       not be enforced during writes until new copies of all containers
       associated with the volume are created.

   If any containers in the CLDB volume fall below the minimum replication
   factor, cluster is inaccessible until aggressive re-replication
   restores the minimum level of replication. If a disk failure is
   detected, any data stored on the failed disk is re-replicated without
   regard to the timeout specified in the cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec
   parameter.

   If all copies of a container, which is neither under nor over
   replicated, are on the same rack, MapR automatically detects and
   distributes the copies, such that they are all not on the same rack,
   after 12 hours. If a container is under replicated and MapR is unable
   to find a different rack for the new copy, the creation of the copy is
   deferred. If another rack is unavailable for the new copy after 3
   hours, MapR creates a copy of the container on the same rack and if
   this results in all copies of the container being on the same rack,
   MapR distributes the copies after 12 hours. Also, during replication,
   MapR tries to defer the scenarios where all copies end up on the same
   rack. As per deferring policy:
     * If a container has copies less than the "minimum replication" but
       greater than 2 and if both copies end up on the same rack, then
       MapR tries to create the third copy on a different rack for up to 3
       hours.
     * If a container has copies more than the minimum but less than the
       desired and if all copies are on the same rack, then MapR tries to
       create the next copy on a different rack for up to 3 hours.

   If namespace (NS) replication and minimum namespace replication are not
   set explicitly, they assume the same values as (data) replication and
   minimum replication respectively. This means that all changes to (data)
   replication and minreplication parameters are also reflected in
   nsreplication and nsminreplication. If nsreplication or
   nsminreplication is modified or specified during creation,
   nsreplication and nsminreplication start assuming values different from
   replication and minreplication.
