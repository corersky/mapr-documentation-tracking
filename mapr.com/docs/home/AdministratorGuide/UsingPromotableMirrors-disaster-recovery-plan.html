Incorporating Mirror Volumes into a Disaster Recovery Plan

   Mirroring critical data to a remote datacenter (with the ability to
   make mirror volumes into read-write volumes) addresses these two
   objectives:
     * Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - the age of the files you need to
       recover (and how much data you can afford to lose)
     * Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - how soon you need to have a working
       datacenter in order to maintain business continuity

   In a typical scenario that employs remote mirrors, the contents of a
   source volume are mirrored to a mirror volume in a remote cluster at a
   frequency specified by the mirror schedule. At the start of each mirror
   operation, a snapshot is taken of the source volume's contents. The
   mirror operation takes some time to complete, and while the data is
   being copied from the snapshot to the mirror volume, more data is
   written to the source volume. This data will be captured during the
   next mirror operation. When each mirror operation completes, the
   contents of the mirror volume are identical to the contents of the
   source volume at the time of the snapshot. For subsequent mirror
   operations, only the incremental changes (additions and deletions) are
   copied to the mirror volume, which synchronizes its contents with the
   contents of the source volume at the time of the snapshot.

   If the source cluster goes down, any data written to the source volume
   since the last successful mirror operation cannot be copied to the
   mirror. The amount of data lost depends on the number of write
   operations in the interval from the last successful mirror to the time
   the cluster goes down.
