Preserving Multiple Versions of Configuration Files

   If you want to save multiple versions of customized configuration
   files, you can take snapshots of mapr.configuration to preserve each
   version you create.

   This maybe helpful if you want to try various versions of the
   configuration files on the cluster.
   Warning: Before a local configuration file is updated by the
   pullcentralconfiguration script, a backup of the current version is
   created. The file extension .bkp indicates the back-up configuration
   file.
