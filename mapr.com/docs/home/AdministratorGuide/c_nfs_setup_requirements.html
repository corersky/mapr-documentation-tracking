Before You Start Using MapR NFS

   Make sure the following conditions are met before using the MapR NFS
   gateway:
     * The stock Linux NFS service must not be running. Linux NFS and MapR
       NFS cannot run concurrently.
     * MapR NFSv3 and NFSv4 should not be installed on the same node.
     * The lock manager (nlockmgr) must be disabled.
     * On Red Hat and CentOS v6.0 and higher, the rpcbind service must be
       running.
       You can use the command ps ax | grep rpcbind to check.
     * On Red Hat and CentOS v5.x and lower, and on Ubuntu and SUSE, the
       portmapper service must be running.
       You can use the command ps ax | grep portmap to check.
     * The mapr-nfs package for NFSv3 or mapr-nfs4server package for NFSv4
       must be present and installed.
       You can list the contents in the /opt/mapr/roles directory to check
       for nfs in the list.
     * Make sure you have applied a Community Edition (M3) license or an
       Enterprise Edition (M5) license (paid or trial) to the cluster.
       See [1]Adding a License.
     * Make sure the MapR NFS service is started.
       See [2]Starting, Stopping, and Restarting MapR NFSv3 or
       [3]Starting, Stopping, and Restarting MapR NFSv4.
     * Verify that the primary group of the user listed for
       mapr.daemon.user in the /opt/mapr/conf/daemon.conf file is
       mapr.daemon.group.
       Restart Warden after any changes to daemon.conf.

   For information about mounting the cluster using:
     * NFSv3, see [4]Accessing Data with NFSv3.
     * NFSv4, see [5]Accessing Data with NFSv4.

   For information on upgrading your cluster, see [6]Upgrading MapR Core.
   Warning: To preserve compatibility with 32-bit applications and system
   calls, MapR-NFS uses 32-bit inode numbers by default. On 64-bit
   clients, this default forces the client's 64-bit inode numbers to be
   hashed down to 32 bits. Hashing 64-bit inodes down to 32 bits can
   potentially cause inum conflicts. To change the default behavior to
   64-bit inode numbers, set the value of the Use32BitFileId property to 0
   in the nfsserver.conf file, then restart the NFS server.
