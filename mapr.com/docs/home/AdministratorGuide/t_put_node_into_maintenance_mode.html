Putting a Node into Maintenance Mode

   Before putting a node into maintenance mode, make sure that:
     * All copies of CLDB volume exists if the node is a CLDB node. You
       can shut down the CLDB service on a node only if the CLDB is a
       slave CLDB or if high availability for CLDB is enabled.
       Note: A node that is running both the CLDB and MapR Filesystem
       services cannot be put into maintenance mode. You can shut down the
       CLDB service on the node as long as it is a secondary CLDB node or
       High Availability for CLDB is enabled.
     * All running processing tasks (such as NodeManager, Spark, etc.)
       that depend on MapR Filesystem have been stopped.

   Warning: Do not put a node under maintenance if there are any volume
   under-replicated alarms because doing so may make some data completely
   offline.
   To put a node into maintenance mode, follow this process:
    1. From a terminal, issue the [1]node maintenance command:
maprcli node maintenance -nodes <IP|hostname> -timeoutminutes <minutes>
       When running this command, specify a timeout (in minutes) long
       enough for you to perform necessary maintenance on the node.
       Note: For the duration of the timeout, the cluster's CLDB does not
       consider this node's data as lost and does not trigger a resync of
       the data on this node. However, if a node is put under maintenance
       for more than 5 minutes, MapR Filesystem will be shut down on that
       node so that any client(s) accessing containers on this node will
       get appropriate error and retry other container copies.
    2. Stop warden on the node.
