Putting a Node into Maintenance Mode

   Describes how to put a node into maintainance mode.
   Before putting a node into maintenance mode, ensure that:
     * All copies of the CLDB volume exist if the node is a CLDB node. You
       can shut down the CLDB service on a node only if the CLDB is a
       slave CLDB or if high availability for CLDB is enabled.
       You cannot put a node that is running both the CLDB and MapR
       Filesystem services into maintenance mode. You can shut down the
       CLDB service on the node as long as it is a secondary CLDB node or
       if you have enabled High Availability for CLDB.
     * All running processing tasks (such as NodeManager, Spark, for
       example) that depend on the MapR Filesystem have been stopped.

   Warning: Do not put a node under maintenance if there are any volume
   under-replicated alarms because doing so may make some data completely
   offline.
   To put a node into maintenance mode, perform the following actions:
    1. From a terminal, issue the [1]node maintenance command:
maprcli node maintenance -nodes <IP|hostname> -timeoutminutes <minutes>
       When you run this command, specify a timeout (in minutes) long
       enough for you to perform necessary maintenance on the node.
       Note: For the duration of the timeout, the cluster's CLDB does not
       consider the data of this node as lost and does not trigger a
       resync of the data on this node. However, if a node is put under
       maintenance for more than 5 minutes, the MapR Filesystem is shut
       down on that node so that clients who access containers on this
       node receive the appropriate error and retry other container
       copies. This value of 5 minutes is hardcoded and cannot be changed.
    2. Stop warden on the node.
