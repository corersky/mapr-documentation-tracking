Planning for High Availability

   Configuring a cluster for HA (High Availability) involves running
   redundant instances of specific services, and configuring NFS properly.
   When properly licensed and configured for HA, the MapR cluster provides
   automatic failover for continuity throughout the stack.

   The following table provides the minimum number of instances of each
   core service required for HA:

   CAPTION:

   Service Minimum Number of Instances Comments
   CLDB 2
   ZooKeeper 3 At least 3 are needed to maintain a quorum in case one
   instance fails.
   NFS 2 NFS can be configured for HA using virtual IP addresses (VIPs).
   ResourceManager 2

   In HA clusters, it is appropriate to run more than one instance of the
   WebServer with a load balancer to provide failover. NFS can be
   configured for HA using VIPs.

   The following sections provide information about HA planning:
