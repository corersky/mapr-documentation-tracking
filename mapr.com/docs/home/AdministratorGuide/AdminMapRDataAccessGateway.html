Administering the MapR Data Access Gateway

   The MapR Data Access Gateway is a service that acts as a proxy and
   gateway for translating requests between lightweight client
   applications and the MapR cluster. This section describes
   considerations when upgrading the service, how to modify configuration
   settings, and how to administer and manage the service.

Installing the Data Access Gateway Service

   The MapR Data Access Gateway is installed when you install MapR
   Database in the MapR installer. To manually install the service, see
   [1]Installing MapR Data Access Gateway. For conceptual information, see
   [2]Understanding the MapR Data Access Gateway.

Upgrading the Data Access Gateway Service

   When the Data Access Gateway receives a shutdown request, it stops
   accepting new requests and returns an error to the client. Any
   in-progress requests are allowed to complete before shutting down the
   service. This allows you to perform rolling upgrades.

Modifying Configuration Settings for the Data Access Gateway Service

   Logging Properties

   The MapR Data Access Gateway uses standard Log4J configuration to
   control its logging. The log4j properties are in the file
   /opt/mapr/data-access-gateway/conf/log4j2.xml on nodes where you have
   installed the service. After modifying any properties on a node,
   restart the service. For details, see [3]Administering the Data Access
   Gateway Service.

   Log data is stored in the
   /opt/mapr/data-access-gateway/logs/data-access-gateway.log file.
   Application Properties

   You can configure MapR Data Access Gateway properties by modifying
   /opt/mapr/data-access-gateway/conf/properties.cfg on nodes where you
   have installed the service.

   The following table lists the properties you can set:
   Property Name Default Description
   auth.token.expiration 1800 Expiration time (in seconds) for the
   authentication token
   grpc.service.ojai.query.result-limit 5000 Limit on the number of
   documents returned in retrieval requests using the Node.js and Python
   OJAI clients
   grpc.service.port 5678 Port number gRPC clients use to connect to the
   Data Access Gateway. The Node.js and Python OJAI clients are gRPC
   clients.
   grpc.service.ssl.enabled cluster Controls whether TLS is enabled for
   the gRPC Service

   Values: cluster|true|false
   If set to cluster:
     * TLS is enabled if your MapR cluster is secure
     * TLS is disabled if your MapR cluster is not secure

   When TLS is enabled, the SSL provider is OpenSSL.
   rest.https.port 8243 Port number used to connect to the Data Access
   Gateway using HTTPS
   rest.result.limit 5000 Limit on the number of documents returned in
   retrieval requests using the MapR Database JSON REST API

   There is also a configuration file
   /opt/mapr/data-access-gateway/conf/ojai-config.json for parameters used
   by Data Access Gateway clients:
     * MapR Database JSON REST API
     * Node.js OJAI
     * Python OJAI
     * C#
     * Go

   A parameter you can modify is the client sort limit:
{
    "ojai": {
        "mapr": {
            "query": {
                "max-client-sort-limit": 6000
            }
        }
    }
}

   To understand why you might want to modify this parameter, see
   [4]Comparisons and Sorts in OJAI Queries.

   After modifying any parameters on a node, restart the service, as
   described in [5]Administering the Data Access Gateway Service.
   Warden Configuration

   The warden configuration for the MapR Data Access Gateway is in the
   file /opt/mapr/data-access-gateway/conf/warden.data-access-gateway.conf
   on nodes where you have installed the Data Access Gateway. To control
   the amount of memory allocated to the service, modify the following
   settings:
   Parameter Default Description
   service.heapsize.max 3000 Defines the maximum heap size (in MB) for the
   service
   service.heapsize.min 3000 Defines the minimum heap size (in MB) for the
   service

   After modifying the warden configuration file on a node, run
   configure.sh -R, and restart the service:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
maprcli node services -nodes <node name> -name data-access-gateway -action resta
rt

Administering the Data Access Gateway Service

   The MapR Data Access Gateway is a service that you administer in the
   same way as other MapR services. The name of the service is
   data-access-gateway.
   To restart the service through the CLI, run the following command:
maprcli node services -nodes <node name> -name data-access-gateway -action resta
rt

   For details about other operations you can perform on the service, see
   [6]Managing Services.
