Metric Visualization

   Use dashboards to visualize the metrics across multiple nodes and
   clusters.

   A single dashboard can be used across multiple nodes in the cluster,
   for an entire cluster, or for multiple clusters. Use metric tags to
   filter the type of data that you want to see in a dashboard. For
   information about the tags available for each metric, see [1]Metric
   Collection
   Use the following resources to start visualizing metrics:

   View sample dashboards
          As of MEP 1.1, the Grafana UI includes sample CLDB, node, and
          volume dashboards. For more information, see [2]Sample
          Dashboards in Grafana.

   Learn how to use Grafana
          For information about creating and using dashboards, see the
          [3]Grafana documentation.

   Ask questions and share ideas
          [4]MapR's Community Exchange is a good place to ask questions
          and share ideas. It also has sample dashboards, some of which
          are already included in Grafana by default.
