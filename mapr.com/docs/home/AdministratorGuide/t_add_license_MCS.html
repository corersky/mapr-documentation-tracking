Adding a License Using the MapR Control System

   Complete the following steps to add a license using the MapR Control
   System:
    1. On a machine that is connected to the cluster and to the Internet,
       perform the following steps to open the MapR Control System and
       install the license:
         a. In a browser, view the MapR Control System by navigating to
            the node that is running the MapR Control System:
            https:/<webserver>/:8443 Your computer won't have an HTTPS
            certificate yet, so the browser will warn you that the
            connection is not trustworthy. You can ignore the warning this
            time.
         b. The first time MapR starts, you must accept the Terms of Use
            and choose whether to enable the MapR [1]Dial Home service.
         c. Log in to the MapR Control System as the administrative user
            you designated earlier. Until a license is applied, the MapR
            Control System dashboard might show some nodes in the amber
            "degraded" state. Don't worry if not all nodes are green and
            "healthy" at this stage.

    2. In the navigation pane of the MapR Control System, expand the
       System Settings Views group and click Manage Licenses to display
       the MapR License Management dialog.
         a. Click Add Licenses via Web.
         b. If the cluster is already registered, the license is applied
            automatically. Otherwise, click OK to register the cluster on
            MapR.com and follow the instructions there.
