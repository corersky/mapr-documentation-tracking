Troubleshooting the FUSE-Based POSIX Client

   This section contains information for troubleshooting the FUSE-Based
   POSIX client.

Enabling Traces

   To enable traces at system startup, set the the property fs.mapr.trace
   in [1]core-site.xml file. For example:
<property>
   <name>fs.mapr.trace</name>
   <value>DEBUG | INFO | WARN | ERROR | CRITICAL | OFF</value>
   <description> </description>
</property>

Collecting the Stacktrace

   If the mountpoint is not responding or if the filesystem operations are
   taking too much time, collect the stacktrace of all the threads to
   debug. To collect the stacktrace of all threads, run the following
   command:
gstack <fuse-process-id> > ./gstack.log

   If the filesystem commands fail, repeat the filesystem command with
   strace and collect the log file:
strace <filesystem command> > ./strace.log
