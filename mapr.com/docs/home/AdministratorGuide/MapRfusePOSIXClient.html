MapR FUSE-Based POSIX Client

   The MapR FUSE-based POSIX Client allows app servers, web servers, and
   other client nodes and apps to read and write data directly and
   securely to a MapR cluster like a Linux filesystem.

   The FUSE-based MapR POSIX client runs as a userspace process to connect
   to one or more MapR clusters. The necessary FUSE (Filesystem in
   Userspace) library (libfuse) is bundled with POSIX client package. With
   the installation of the POSIX client package, the MapR POSIX client
   performs operations like read and write on the filesystem exposed by
   FUSE. The following diagram illustrates how the MapR FUSE-based POSIX
   client works.

   The table below summarizes the differences between the POSIX loopback
   NFS client and the FUSE-based POSIX Basic and Platinum clients:

   CAPTION:

   MapR POSIX Loopback NFS Client MapR FUSE-based POSIX Basic/Platinum
   Client
   Throughput
     * 500MB/s for remote read/write
     * 1G/s for local read/write

   Greater than 2G/s for remote and local read/write
   Client OS Supported Linux and Ubuntu distributions only.
   Installs On Node Type
     * Client node
     * Cluster node

   Access to Cluster Must have direct network access to all MapR cluster
   nodes. Must have direct network access to all MapR cluster nodes.
   However, each client only supports up to 16 clusters.
   Connection to File System
     * Proxied on host to regular MapR client traffic
     * Direct, no NFS gateway
     * No single point of failure

   Security Fully secured.
   Caching Buffered writes are cached in the kernel. Buffered writes are
   cached (only in kernel >= 3.15) if writeback option is enabled.
