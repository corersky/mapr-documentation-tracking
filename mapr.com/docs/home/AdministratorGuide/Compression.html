Managing Compression

   MapR provides compression for files stored in the cluster. Compression
   is applied automatically to uncompressed files unless you turn
   compression off. The advantages of compression are:
     * Compressed data uses less bandwidth on the network than
       uncompressed data.
     * Compressed data uses less disk space.
