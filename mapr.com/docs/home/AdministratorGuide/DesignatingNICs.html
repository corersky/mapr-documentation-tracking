Designating NICs for MapR

   By default, MFS instances and the CLDB nodes advertise all the
   available IP addresses and MapR automatically uses all available
   network interface cards (NICs) on each node for all communication. For
   nodes that have multiple NICs, MapR supports segregation of NICs such
   that certain IPs can be used for clients/communication within the
   cluster and certain IPs can be used for clients/communication from/to
   outside the cluster. Also, NICs can be segregated for specific
   (high-performance and/or low-performance) clients within the cluster.

   For example, if you use multiple NICs of mixed speeds (such as 1GbE and
   10GbE) on each node, you might want to separate them to two different
   networks depending upon the ethernet card speeds. You can assign IP
   addresses in the same network to the NICs of 1GbE and assign IP
   addresses in another network to the the NICs of 10GbE. That way, you
   can use the faster NICs for communication within the cluster or for
   certain high-performance clients (for example, FUSE-based POSIX client)
   and the slower NICs for external communication or for low-performance
   clients/jobs.

   To illustrate this arrangement, the following diagram shows six nodes
   on a MapR cluster, each with a 1GbE NIC (eth0) and a 10GbE NIC (eth1).
   All the 1GbE NICs are networked together and connected to Network B.
   Likewise, all the 10GbE NICs are networked together (as part of a
   subnet written as 10.10.10.0/24 in CIDR notation) and connected to
   Network A, where peak performance is required. ClientA, which is within
   the cluster, communicates with cluster nodes over Network A and clients
   outside the cluster communicate with cluster nodes over Network B. The
   illustration also shows ClientB, which is a low-performance client
   inside the cluster, communicating with cluster nodes over Network B.

   MapR provides two environment variables, MAPR_SUBNETS and
   MAPR_EXTERNAL, which can be used to segregate NICs for internal and
   external clients or to segregate NICs for high-performance and
   low-performance clients.

About MAPR_SUBNETS Environment Variable

   The MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable can be used to restrict MapR to a
   subset of NICs. If MAPR_SUBNETS is not set, all IPs are available for
   all communication. When MAPR_SUBNETS is set on:
     * MFS nodes, MFS registers these IP addresses with CLDB as internal
       IP addresses on which MFS nodes can be reached.
     * CLDB nodes, CLDB advertises the IP address to clients on the
       cluster.

   The MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable can be set on all the nodes. On
   the cluster nodes, the value for this environment variable is a
   comma-separated list of subnet masks. For example:
export MAPR_SUBNETS=10.10.15.0/24,10.10.16.0/24

   You can specify up to four NICs in the MAPR_SUBNETS environment
   variable. If your system has more than four NICs, MapR advertises the
   first four it finds or if MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable is set,
   MapR restricts the networks/IPs that are advertised based on the
   subnets specified therein.

   The MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable can be set on the client if there
   is a NAT between the server and client. On the client host, the value
   for this environment variable is any one IP address of the client. For
   example:
export MAPR_SUBNETS=10.11.12.13/32

   When specifying the IP address in the MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable
   on the client host, use /32 to specify a single IP address.

About MAPR_EXTERNAL Environment Variable

   If all the IP addresses on the servers are public and can be accessed
   from outside, the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable need not be set.
   On the other hand, if your cluster nodes have private IP addresses, to
   allow clients outside the cluster to reach the cluster nodes (such as
   when MapR is installed on the cloud or Docker container), the public IP
   addresses can be specified in the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable.

   This variable can be set on the cluster nodes only. When MAPR_EXTERNAL
   environment variable is set on:
     * MFS nodes, MFS registers these IP addresses with CLDB as the IP
       addresses on which external clients can reach MFS nodes.
       Communication between MFS nodes on the cluster still happen over
       the internal IP addresses.
     * CLDB nodes, CLDB advertises these IPs addresses to clients outside
       the cluster or data center.

   Note: Do not set the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable on the client
   host(s).

   The value for this environment variable is a comma-separated list of IP
   addresses; you cannot specify the hostname as value. For example:
ip1,ip2,ip3;

   For example, you can specify the IP addresses of the IGbE NICs (shown
   in the illustration above) as the value for this environment variable
   to allow external or low-performance clients to communicate with the
   cluster nodes.
export MAPR_EXTERNAL=10.11.0.0

About IP Addresses for ZooKeeper Nodes

   You can specify the IP addresses of ZooKeeper nodes by running the
   configure.sh utility with both the -Z and -EZ options during cluster
   configuration and list the:
     * Internal IP addresses with the -Z option
     * External IP addresses with the -EZ option

   When you specify the IP addresses using the -Z and -EZ options, these
   IP addresses are registered with CLDB and included in the cldb.conf
   file. In the cldb.conf file, the internal IP addresses set using the -Z
   option are the values for the cldb.zookeeper.servers parameter and the
   external IP addresses set using the -EZ option are the values for the
   cldb.external.zookeeper.servers parameter.
   Note: The configure.sh command with the -EZ option need not be run
   during client configuration.

   For more information, see [1]configure.sh.

   If all the ZooKeepers have different IP addresses, port forwarding is
   not required and, optionally, you can specify the same port with all
   the IP addresses. However, in some cases, such as when there is a
   single external IP address being used by multiple ZooKeepers (as in a
   Docker container), you can specify ports for ZooKeepers when you run
   the configure.sh utility with the -Z and -EZ options. For more
   information, see [2]Specifying Ports.

About Internal and External Clients

   Clients communicating with CLDB using internal IP address (of CLDB) are
   considered internal clients (or clients within the cluster) and clients
   communicating with CLDB using external IP address (of CLDB) are
   considered external clients (or clients outside the cluster).

   To configure a client as an internal or high-performance client,
   include CLDB’s internal IP address in the mapr-clusters.conf file on
   the client host. Similarly, to configure a client as an external or
   low-performance client, include CLDB’s external IP address in the
   mapr-clusters.conf file on the client host.

   The mapr-clusters.conf file on the client host should not contain both
   internal and external IP addresses of the server on a cluster. The
   mapr-clusters.conf file can contain internal and external IP addresses
   only when the entries in the file on the client host are for multiple
   clusters. For example, suppose a client, which is an internal client on
   one cluster and external client on another cluster. The
   mapr-clusters.conf file on the client host can contain CLDB’s internal
   IP address for the cluster on which the client is considered an
   internal client and CLDB’s external IP address for the cluster on which
   the client is considered an external client.
   Note: The mapr-clusters.conf file on the cluster nodes should not
   contain any external IP address.

Limitations

   If:
     * Both MAPR_SUBNETS and MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variables are set,
       segregation of NICs for internal and external communication is
       possible. Internal communication happens over the IP addresses
       listed in the MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable and external
       communication happens over the IP addresses listed in the
       MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable.
     * Only MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable is set, MFS registers the IP
       addresses (in the MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable) with CLDB as
       internal IPs.
     * Only MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable is set, the environment
       variable setting is ignored and all the NICs are used for internal
       communication; external communication from/to outside the cluster
       is not possible.

   Note: Both the environment variables must be set to segregate internal
   or high performance clients and external or low-performance clients.

   You can specify up to 4 IP addresses in the MAPR_SUBNETS environment
   variable 4 IP addresses in the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable.
   Note: ZooKeeper must be configured with an IP address that is reachable
   by both internal and external clients.
