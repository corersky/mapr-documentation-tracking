Listing the Configuration Files for Each Service

   Each service on a node has one or more configuration files associated
   with it. The default version of each configuration file can be used as
   a template that you can modify as needed.

   Files in the following directory contain the list of configuration
   files for each installed service: /opt/mapr/servicesconf/<service>.
   Use the following command to display the configuration files or the
   directory that contains the configuration files for each service:
# cat /opt/mapr/servicesconf/<service>

   For example, the following command displays the configuration files for
   NodeManager:
# cat /opt/mapr/servicesconf/nodemanager
hadoop/hadoop-2.4.1/etc/hadoop
conf/hadoop_version

   Note: All pathnames are relative to $MAPR_HOME.

   The following table contains the configuration files and configuration
   file directories available for Hadoop and Hbase:
