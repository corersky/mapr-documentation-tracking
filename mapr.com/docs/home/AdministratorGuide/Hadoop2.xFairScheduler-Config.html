Configuring the Fair Scheduler

   The Fair Scheduler lets all applications run by default, but you can
   also limit the number of running applications per user and per queue
   through the configuration file. This can be useful when a user must
   submit hundreds of applications at once, or in general to improve
   performance if running too many applications at once would cause too
   much intermediate data to be created or too much context-switching.
   Limiting the applications does not cause any subsequently submitted
   applications to fail; it only causes them to wait in the scheduler's
   queue until earlier applications finish.
   To customize the Fair Scheduler, set configuration properties in
   yarn-site.xml and update the allocation file to list existing queues
   and their respective weights and capacities. The allocation file is
   automatically created during MapR installation, The default location
   for this file is:
{$MAPR_HOME}/hadoop/hadoop-2.x/etc/hadoop/fair-scheduler.xml

   The file is reloaded every 10 seconds to refresh the scheduler with any
   modified settings that are specified in the file.
