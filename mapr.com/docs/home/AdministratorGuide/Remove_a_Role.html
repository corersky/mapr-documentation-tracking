Removing a Role

   The following steps describe how to remove a role from a node:
   Note: Do not use these steps to remove the CLDB, ZooKeeper, or
   Fileserver role from a node.
    1. If you are removing the NFS role, unmount any existing client
       mounts.
       Removing the NFS role from a node affects any Virtual IP (VIP)
       pools that include this node.
    2. If the cluster has only one CLDB, run configure.sh with the -C
       option on all the nodes.
    3. Stop the service for the role you want to remove, either through
       the MapR Control System (MCS) or by issuing a maprcli command:
% maprcli node services -name <service_name> -action stop -nodes <node-name>
       The following example stops the webserver role on node "my-node":
% maprcli node services -name webserver -action stop -nodes my-node
    4. Purge the role packages with the apt-get, yum, or zypper commands,
       depending on your operating system.
    5. Run configure.sh -R on the node where you removed the role.
       Warden picks up the new configuration automatically.
    6. Issue the following command to restart Warden on the node where you
       removed the role:
% service mapr-warden restart
