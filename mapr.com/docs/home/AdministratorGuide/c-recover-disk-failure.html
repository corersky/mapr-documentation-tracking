Recovering from Disk Failure

   Most software failures can be remedied by running the fsck utility,
   which scans the storage pool that the disk belongs to and reports
   errors. For hardware failures, remove the failed disk and replace it
   according to the procedure in[1] Removing and Replacing Disks.
   The following table lists types of failures and recommended courses of
   action:
   Error Failure Reason Recommended Course of Action
   I/OTimeOut Error The default value for mfs.disk.io.timeout parameter is
   60 seconds. The time to declare an IO as stuck is 3 times the value of
   this parameter (3 x mfs.disk.io.timeout). The disk will be taken
   offline even if a single IO has not completed.
    1. Check if the disks are good and still reliable.
    2. If disks are good, increase the value of the mfs.io.disk.timeout
       parameter in the /opt/mapr/conf/mfs.conf file. Otherwise, replace
       the disks.

   No such device The $INSTALL_DIR/conf/disktab file contains
   "/MissingDisk" or references a disk path not found in /proc/partitions
   file. Run mrdisk <device path> to determine whether a disk is formatted
   for MapR-FS. Also, check the device paths in $INSTALL_DIR/conf/disktab
   file. The disktab file contains the disk path and disk GUID that is
   used to load the disks in MFS. If the disk paths have been renamed, fix
   them or run disksetup -X command to regenerate disktab from
   /proc/partitions. Alternatively, restart MFS to resolve disk name
   changes.

   If the problem still persists, contact MapR support.
   ENODEV: MissingDisk# Error: disktab file contains a /MissingDisk# entry
   A disk corresponding to a GUID is missing and the corresponding disk
   path in the disktab file belongs to another disk. When attempt is made
   to automatically fix the disktab file, this entry is replaced with
   /MissingDisk# path. If a disk corresponding to a GUID is permanently
   lost, remove the line corresponding to it in the disktab file.
   Alternatively, run maprcli disk remove _MissingDisk# command, where #
   corresponds to the disk number and restart MFS.
   EIO Error I/O error. This could be due to a bad block or disk. The
   system will offline the SP after one final attempt to complete the IO.
   Check /var/log/messages for errors from the disk drivers.
   CRC error This could be due to a bad block or bit flip on the disk. The
   SP will be taken offline immediately. Run fsck -n <sp> -d to perform a
   CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) on the data blocks in the storage pool,
   then bring it back online.

   To load all the SPs to the list of SPs, run:
mrconfig disk load or mrconfig sp load

   To bring back all SPs online, run:
mrconfig sp refresh

   To bring specific SPs back online, run:
mrconfig sp online <sp path>

   SlowDisk Error The default value for mfs.disk.io.timeout parameter is
   60 seconds. The time to declare an IO as slow is equal to the value of
   this parameter (1 x mfs.disk.io.timeout). Thirty or more slow IO
   completions in a short span of time (5 seconds) on the same disk is
   recorded as a slow event. The SP will be taken offline if 3 such events
   are recorded within an hour.
   Note: After an hour, MapR-FS will reset tracking (to 0).
    1. Check if the disks are good and still reliable.
    2. If disks are good, increase the value of the mfs.io.disk.timeout
       parameter in the /opt/mapr/conf/mfs.conf file. Otherwise, replace
       the disks.

   GUID of disk mismatches with the one in $INSTALL_DIR/conf/disktab It's
   possible that disk names have changed. After a node restart, the
   operating system can reassign the drive labels (for example, /sda),
   resulting in drive labels no longer matching the entries in the disktab
   file. The disktab file contains the disk path and disk GUID that is
   used to load the disks in MFS. Run $INSTALL_DIR/server/disksetup -X to
   update the disktab file by looking up the disks in /proc/partitions and
   make the disk paths match the GUIDs.
   Unknown error   Contact MapR support.
