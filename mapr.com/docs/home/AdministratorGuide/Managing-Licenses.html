Managing Licenses

   You can add and remove licenses on your cluster using the MapR Control
   System or the command line:
     * In the MapR Control System, go to Admin > Cluster Settings >
       Licenses.
     * On the command line, use the [1]maprcli license commands.

   Warning: Remove old licenses from the cluster when you add a new
   license. If multiple licenses exist, the cluster will activate only the
   license with the lowest node count.
