Handling Disk Failures

   When a disk fails, MapR raises the node-level alarm
   NODE_ALARM_DISK_FAILURE on the node with the failed disk (or disks). At
   the same time, other disks in the same storage pool as the failed disk
   are taken offline. You can look at the MapR Control System (MCS)
   Overview page to view the health of the nodes and a list of alarms.

   When you see a disk failure alarm, examine the log file at
   /opt/mapr/logs/faileddisk.log and check the Failure Reason field.
