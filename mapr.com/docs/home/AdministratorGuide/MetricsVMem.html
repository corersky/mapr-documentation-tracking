Virtual Memory Metrics

   Every 10 seconds, the collectd service uses the vmem plugin to gather
   the following memory metrics on each node in the cluster.

   CAPTION:

   Name Description
   vmem.vmpage_faults.majflt The number of major page faults. Major page
   faults require pages to be accessed from disk.
   vmem.vmpage_faults.minflt The number of minor page faults. Minor page
   faults can be resolved by sharing pages that are already in memory.
