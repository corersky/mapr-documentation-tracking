MapR-FS Metrics

   Every 10 seconds, the collectd service uses a MapR plugin to gather the
   following MapR-FS metrics on each node in the cluster.
   Name Description
   mapr.fs.bulk_writes The number of bulk-write operations. Bulk-write
   operations occur when the MapR-FS container master aggregates multiple
   small file writes from one or more clients into one big RPC before
   replicating the writes.
   mapr.fs.bulk_writesbytes The number of bytes written by bulk-write
   operations. Bulk-write operations occur when the MapR-FS container
   master aggregates multiple small file writes from one or more clients
   into one big RPC before replicating the writes.
   mapr.fs.kvstore_delete The number of delete operations on key-value
   store files which are used by the CLDB and MapR-DB.
   mapr.fs.kvstore_insert The number of insert operations on key-value
   store files which are used by the CLDB and MapR-DB.
   mapr.fs.kvstore_lookup The number of lookup operations on key-value
   store files which are used by the CLDB and MapR-DB.
   mapr.fs.kvstore_scan The number of scan operations on key-value store
   files which are used by the CLDB and MapR-DB.
   mapr.fs.local_readbytes The number of bytes read by applications that
   are running on the MapR-FS node where the data resides.
   mapr.fs.local_reads The number of file read operations by applications
   that are running on the MapR-FS node where the data resides.
   mapr.fs.local_writebytes The number of bytes written by applications
   that are running on the MapR-FS node where the data resides.
   mapr.fs.local_writes The number of file write operations by
   applications that are running on the MapR-FS node where the data
   resides.
   mapr.fs.read_bytes The amount of data read remotely in MB.
   mapr.fs.read_cachehits The number of cache hits for file reads. This
   value includes pages that MapR-FS populates using readahead mechanism.
   mapr.fs.read_cachemisses The number of cache misses for file read
   operations.
   mapr.fs.reads The number of remote reads.
   mapr.fs.statstype_create The number of file create operations.
   mapr.fs.statstype_lookup The number of lookup operations.
   mapr.fs.statstype_read The number of file read operations.
   mapr.fs.statstype_write The number of file write operations.
   mapr.fs.write_bytes The amount of data written remotely in MB.
   mapr.fs.writes The number of remote writes.
