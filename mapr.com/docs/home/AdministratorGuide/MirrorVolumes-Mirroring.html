Mirror Volumes

   Creating a mirror volume is similar to creating a normal read/write
   volume. However, when you create a mirror volume, you must specify a
   source volume that the mirror retrieves content from. This retrieval is
   called the mirroring operation. Like a normal volume, a mirror volume
   has a configurable replication factor. Only one copy of the data is
   transmitted from the source volume to the mirror volume; the source and
   mirror volumes handle their own replication independently. MapR-FS
   replicates source and mirror volumes independently of each other.
   Note: Volume mirroring from a lower MapR version to higher MapR version
   is supported. For example, you can mirror volumes from a MapR 4.0.1
   cluster to a MapR 5.2 cluster. However, you cannot mirror volumes from
   a MapR 5.2 cluster to a MapR 4.0.1 cluster.

Mirroring Process

   The MapR system creates a temporary snapshot of the source volume at
   the start of a mirroring operation. The mirroring process reads content
   from the snapshot into the mirror volume. The source volume remains
   available for read and write operations during the mirroring process.

   If the mirroring operation is schedule-based, the snapshot expires
   according to the value of the schedule's Retain For parameter.
   Snapshots created during manual mirroring persist until they are
   deleted manually.

   The mirroring process transmits only the differences between the source
   volume and the mirror. The initial mirroring operation copies the
   entire source volume, but subsequent mirroring operations can be
   extremely fast. If the fastinodescan feature is enabled, mirroring will
   proceed significantly faster when there are large number of files and
   few changes since the last mirroring operation. The fastinodescan
   feature is enabled by default for all new installations, but must be
   manually enabled if you are upgrading from pre-5.2.x versions. See the
   [1]Upgrade Guide for information on enabling this feature. To determine
   whether the fastinodescan feature is enabled, run the following
   command:
maprcli config load -json | grep mfs.feature.fastinodescan.support

   To avail of the fastinodescan feature on converted or promoted volumes,
   mirroring must be restarted from the source volume after converting
   volume from mirror to read-write and vice versa.

   The mirroring operation never consumes all available network bandwidth,
   and throttles back when other processes need more network bandwidth.
   The server sending mirror data continuously monitors the total
   round-trip time between the data transmission and arrival, and uses
   this information to restrict itself to 30% of the available bandwidth
   (continuously calculated). If the network or servers anywhere along the
   entire path need more bandwidth, the sending server throttles back
   automatically. If more bandwidth opens up, the sender automatically
   increases how fast it sends data. Mirror throttling can be disabled so
   that all available bandwidth is devoted to mirror operations. See
   [2]Disabling Mirror Throttling for details.

   During the copy process, the mirror is a fully-consistent image of the
   source volume. Mirrors are atomically updated at the mirror
   destination. The mirror does not change until all bits are transferred,
   at which point all the new files, directories, blocks, etc., are
   atomically moved into their new positions in the mirror-volume. The
   previous mirror is left behind as a snapshot, which can be accessed
   from the .snapshot directory. These old snapshots can be deleted on a
   schedule.

   Mirroring is extremely resilient. In the case of a network partition,
   where some or all of the machines that host the source volume cannot
   communicate with the machines that host the mirror volume, the
   mirroring operation periodically retries the connection. Once the
   network is restored, the mirroring operation resumes.
