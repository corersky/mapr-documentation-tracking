Choosing a Compression Setting

   MapR supports three different compression algorithms:
     * lz4 (default)
     * lzf
     * zlib

   Compression algorithms can be evaluated for compression ratio (higher
   compression means less disk space used), compression speed and
   decompression speed. The following table gives a comparison for the
   three supported algorithms. The data is based on a single-thread, Core
   2 Duo at 3 GHz.

   197 MB/s

   465 MB/s

   zlib

   14 MB/s

   210 MB/s

   Note that compression speed depends on various factors including:
     * block size (the smaller the block size, the faster the compression
       speed)
     * single-thread vs. multi-thread system
     * single-core vs. multi-core system
     * the type of codec used
