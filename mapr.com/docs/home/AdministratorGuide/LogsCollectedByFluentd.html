MapR Core Logs

   The fluentd component reads and parses the following MapR Core log
   files on each node in the cluster.
   Service Name Parsing Method Description
   adminuiapp Multi-line MCS logs from
   /opt/mapr/apiserver/logs/apiserver.log.
   cldb Multi-line CLDB server logs from $MAPR_HOME/logs/cldb.log.

   only reads and parses logs from primary fileserver instance. Therefore,
   logs from the secondary fileserver instance will not be indexed by
   Elasticsearch.
