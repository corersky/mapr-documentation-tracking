Specifying Ports

   On installations where the MapR Filesystem instances, CLDB, and/or MAST
   Gateway must be reached on non-standard ports, you can specify the
   ports to advertise in the MAPR_EXTERNAL, CLDB_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT, and
   MASTGATEWAY_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT environment variables respectively. This
   setting does not change the ports used by the servers, but changes the
   ports advertised to clients (to support port forwarding).

   If the cluster nodes are no longer reachable on the standard ports, you
   can specify ports for MapR Filesystem using the MAPR_EXTERNAL
   environment variable. MAPR_EXTERNAL allows the specification of the
   advertised ports for the MapR Filesystem instances only; this
   environment variable cannot be used to specify ports for CLDB or the
   MAST Gateway. Instead, use CLDB_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT environment variable
   to specify port for CLDB and MASTGATEWAY_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT environment
   variable to specify port for MAST Gateway. If ZooKeeper is not
   available on the default port or if there are multiple ZooKeepers
   listening on the same external IP address, you can specify ports for
   each ZooKeeper using the configure.sh utility.

   See the following sections for more information on setting the ports.

Specifying Ports for MapR Filesystem

   If the port forwarding table is set up, ports must be configured for
   every MapR Filesystem node on every MapR Filesystem instance. For more
   information on the number of ports used by MapR Filesystem instance(s),
   see [1]Ports Used by MapR. To specify the ports for MapR Filesystem:
    1. Open the $MAPR_HOME/conf/env_override.sh file. If the
       env_override.sh file is not present, you might have to create it.
       See [2]About env_override.sh.
    2. Set the value for the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable.
       The value for the MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variable is a
       comma-separated list of IP addresses and colon-separated list of
       ports (to use for port forwarding).
       For example:
export MAPR_EXTERNAL=10.11.0.0;9000,9001,9002,9003
       The following example shows 3 MapR Filesystem instances with 4
       ports:
export MAPR_EXTERNAL=10.11.0.0;9000,9001,9002,9003:10000,10001,10002,10003:11000
,11001,11002,11003
       To specify:
          + Multiple IP addresses, use comma to separate the IP addresses.
          + Ports for multiple instances, use:
               o comma (,) to separate the ports for an instance
               o colon (:) to separate the set of ports for each instance
       If ports are not specified, MapR Filesystem is assumed to be
       reachable on the default ports.
    3. Save and close the $MAPR_HOME/conf/env_override.sh file.

Specifying Ports for CLDB

   The default port for CLDB is 7222. If you want to use another port:
    1. Open the $MAPR_HOME/conf/env_override.sh file on the CLDB host(s).
       If the env_override.sh file is not present, you might have to
       create it. See [3]About env_override.sh.
    2. Set the value for the CLDB_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT environment variable
       in the file.
       The value for this environment variable is the port to use for
       CLDB.
       For example:
export CLDB_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT=5000
       This is especially useful if MapR is installed in a Docker
       container or other guest hosts. If this is not set, CLDB must be
       reachable on the default port 7222.
    3. Save and close the $MAPR_HOME/conf/env_override.sh file.
    4. Ensure that the mapr-clusters.conf file on the client host(s)
       contains the correct port number for CLDB.

   Note: After setting this environment variable, make sure that
   cldb.feature.external.ip is enabled if you upgraded from a prior
   version of MapR to v6.0. For more information on enabling this feature,
   see [4]Step 5: Enable New Features.

Specifying Port for MAST Gateway

   The default port for MAST Gateway is 8660. If you want to use another
   port:
    1. Open the $MAPR_HOME/conf/env_override.sh file on the MAST Gateway
       host(s). If the env_override.sh file is not present, you might have
       to create it. See [5]About env_override.sh.
    2. Set the value for the MASTGATEWAY_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT environment
       variable in the file.
       The value for this environment variable is the port to use for MAST
       Gateway.
       For example:
export MASTGATEWAY_EXTERNAL_RPC_PORT=15000
       If this is not set, MAST Gateway must be reachable on the default
       port 8660.
    3. Save and close the $MAPR_HOME/conf/env_override.sh file.

Specifying Ports for ZooKeeper

   If ZooKeeper is not available on the default port or if all the
   ZooKeepers are listening on the same external IP address (such as in a
   Docker container), you can specify the port on which to reach each
   ZooKeeper. To specify the port on which to reach each ZooKeeper, during
   cluster configuration:
   Run the configure.sh utility with the -EZ option.
   The value for the -EZ option is a comma-separated list of external IP
   addresses of the ZooKeeper nodes and the port (for each IP address),
   separated by a colon, on which ZooKeeper can be reached. For example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C <IP|Hostname>[,<IP|Hostname>,...] -Z <IP|Hostna
me>[,<IP|Hostname>,...] -EZ <IP|Hostname>:<Port>[,<IP|Hostname>:<Port>,...]

   For example, you can specify:
     * Different ports when the same external IP address is used for all
       ZooKeeper nodes as shown below:
# /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C 172.17.0.2,172,17.0.3,172.17.0.4 -Z 172.17.0.
2,172,17.0.3,172.17.0.4 -EZ 10.10.104.34:5181,10.10.104.34:5182,10.10.104.34:518
3 -N my.cluster.com
     * Same ports when different IP addresses are specified for ZooKeeper
       nodes:
# /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C 172.17.0.2,172,17.0.3,172.17.0.4 -Z 172.17.0.
2,172,17.0.3,172.17.0.4 -EZ 10.10.104.34:5181,10.20.105.34:5181,10.30.106.34:518
1 -N my.cluster.com

Configuring MR AppMaster Port Mapping

    1. Set the yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.client.port-range parameter in
       the yarn-site.xml file to specific range of free ports in all the
       NodeManager nodes.
       Specify the range of ports that the MapReduce AppMaster can use
       when binding. Do not specify a value for this parameter if you want
       all possible ports. For example:
50000-50050,50100-50200
       Note: Each Docker instance where NodeManager is running should have
       different range and the range should be different across all
       NodeManager nodes.
       For example:
The yarn-site.xml file in docker container 1:
<property>
        <name>yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.client.port-range</name>
        <value>50000-50050</value>
</property>
The yarn-site.xml file in docker container 2:
<property>
        <name>yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.client.port-range</name>
        <value>50100-50150</value>
</property>
The yarn-site.xml file in docker container 3:
<property>
        <name>yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.client.port-range</name>
        <value>50151-50200,50250-50300</value>
</property>
    2. Set the port forwarding rules in host machine for these specific
       ranges.
       For example, if NM1 contains ranges from 50000 to 50050, then set
       the IP table rules such that when requests come on these ports, it
       is forwarded to NM1.
    3. Specify the AWS or Docker host name for the IP address in the
       /etc/hosts file on the client system so that external clients can
       resolve Docker or AWS hostname properly when running the jobs.
       For example, your entry in the /etc/hosts file should look similar
       to the following:
54.208.145.112 ip-10-10-0-103.ec2.internal
