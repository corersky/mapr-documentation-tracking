3. Installing or Removing Software or Hardware

   When the node is stopped, you can add, upgrade or remove software or
   hardware. At some point after adding or removing services, you should
   restart Warden, to re-optimize memory allocation among all the services
   on the node. It is not crucial to perform this step immediately; you
   can restart Warden any time when the cluster is not busy.

   To add or remove individual MapR packages, use the standard package
   management commands for your Linux distribution:
     * apt-get (Ubuntu)
     * yum (Red Hat or CentOS)

   For information about the packages to install, see [1]Planning the
   Cluster.

   The following sections provide information about adding or removing
   services from a node after it has been deployed in a cluster:
