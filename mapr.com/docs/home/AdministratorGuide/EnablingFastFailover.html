Enabling Fast Failover of Services

   MapR Converged Data Platform includes a feature that allows the
   software to detect and recover from network failures fast. For running
   a cluster with Fast Failover characteristics, enable the Fast Failover
   feature:
maprcli config save -values {mfs.feature.fastfailover:1}

   If the fast failover feature is enabled, when MapR Filesystem detects a
   failed node, it declares the node as down very quickly and clients
   experience short latency while the failure is being detected. Once the
   failure is detected, MapR remembers the node that has failed and
   redirects clients to an alternate location (a replica container) for
   the data (instead of repeatedly contacting the failed node).
