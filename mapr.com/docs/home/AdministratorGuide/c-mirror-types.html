Mirror Types

   You can check the status of your volumes in terms of their “mirror
   type.” The maprcli volume info command returns the following mirrortype
   values:
   mirrortype Description Volume upgrade required (to support
   promotability)
   0 Old-format volume, created in an earlier release and present in the
   cluster after an upgrade to Version 5.0 Yes, if the volume is intended
   for use as a read-write mirror.
   1 An old-format mirror volume whose source volume is a type 0 volume
   (in any MapR version). These mirror volumes cannot be upgraded. No, not
   allowed. The maprcli volume upgradeformat command returns an error for
   these volumes.
   2 New-format mirror volume that may be promoted to read-write (no
   upgrade command required). No, not needed. These volumes are already in
   the new format and are promotable.
   3 New-format standard volume: either created new in 5.0 or upgraded in
   5.0 via the maprcli volume promote command. No, not needed. These
   volumes are already in the new format and are promotable.

   To check the mirror types for your volumes in Version 5.0, run the
   following command:
maprcli volume list -columns volumename,mirrortype -json
...
 {
   "volumename":"vol999",
   "mirrortype":0
  },
  {
   "volumename":"volume1",
   "mirrortype":3
  },
  {
   "volumename":"volume2",
   "mirrortype":3
  },
  {
   "volumename":"volume3",
   "mirrortype":2
  },
...
