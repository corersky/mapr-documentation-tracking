Setting Up Central Configuration from the Command-Line

   MapR provides a central location where you can place customized
   configuration files for all the services running on the MapR cluster.
   As a result, you do not have to edit the configuration files on each
   node individually.

   Default configuration files for each service are stored locally under
   /opt/mapr/. You can edit these files to create customized versions of
   the configuration files. To push these changes to other nodes in the
   cluster, copy the customized files to the mapr.configuration volume in
   the MapR file system. When the pullcentralconfig script runs, it
   overwrites the local configuration file in /opt/mapr with the
   customized files on all nodes that the change applies to.

   The mapr.configuration volume is mounted at
   maprfs://var/mapr/configuration.The mapr.configuration volume mount
   location is not configurable and is only used for central
   configuration.
