Tuning the TCP for Fast Failure Detection

   An unplanned failure chiefly takes the form of a node failure or a
   network failure. In both instances, the network layer retries to
   connect to the failed node. The number of retry attempts is dictated by
   the TCP parameter /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries. The default of
   that parameter is 5 (in Linux), resulting in a latency of more than a
   minute to detect the node failure. The problem is compounded when the
   same failed node is contacted repeatedly in the context of a long
   operation, such as when a client accesses multiple data objects present
   on that node.

   MapR stack solves the problem by remembering (caching) the information
   about a nodeâ€™s failure, and by not contacting that node for subsequent
   operations on data objects present on that node. Since all form of data
   is replicated, MapR services find alternative locations for a data
   object. This feature is in-built into the current software and does not
   have to be enabled explicitly. Hence, the communication between a
   client and a recently failed node incurs a one-time long-duration
   latency. As mentioned before, that latency is governed by the number of
   retries at the TCP level. Hence, to further improve the one-time longer
   latency of an operation between a pair of nodes, it is recommended that
   the number of TCP retries be decreased from 5 to 4, resulting in a
   latency of about 30 seconds.

Setting the Timeout for TCP Connections

   To set the TCP retry count, set the value of tcp_syn_retries to 4 in
   the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ directory. For example:
echo 4 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries

   This TCP setting of 4 ensures that the TCP stack takes about 30 seconds
   to detect failure of a remote node. To ensure that this setting is
   persistent across system reboots, set this value in the
   /etc/sysctl.conf file also.
   Warning: This setting impacts all TCP connections to and from a node.
   Hence, caution must be exercised when lowering this further. Also, in
   some instances, reducing this further may result in a node being
   incorrectly flagged as unavailable.
