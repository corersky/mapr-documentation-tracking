Administering Nodes

   This section provides information about managing nodes in a MapR
   cluster. Topics include how to add nodes to the cluster and/or remove
   nodes from the cluster, manage the services installed on the nodes, and
   manage disks. You can manage [1]nodes, [2]disks, and [3]services in the
   MapR cluster using the MapR Control System and the CLI.
