Managing VIPs for NFS

   You can set up a pool of NFS servers on various nodes in your cluster
   and connect to them using virtual IP addresses (VIPs) to achieve HA
   with failover; if one node fails, the VIP will automatically be
   reassigned to another NFS node in the pool. If you do not specify a
   list of NFS nodes to form a pool, then MapR uses any available node
   running the MapR NFS Gateway service. VIPs are not assigned to any
   nodes that are not on the list, regardless of whether they are running
   NFS.
   Note: To add a server to an NFS pool that is not divided into subnets,
   start the MapR NFS service on that server. The MapR cluster
   automatically detects it and adds it to the pool.

   The following illustration shows three nodes (Host1, Host2, and Host3)
   acting as NFS servers. Each node has two NICs whose ports are labeled
   eth0 and eth1. The NICs are grouped into two subnets, called Subnet A
   and Subnet B. Clients can access any of the NFS servers through a pool
   (or range) of VIPs assigned to each subnet. MapR assigns each VIP
   address in the pool at random to a MAC address in the subnet (with its
   corresponding physical IP address).

   The initial VIP assignment shown above is summarized in the following
   table. If one NFS server becomes unavailable, the VIP assigned to that
   server is automatically assigned to another server on the same subnet.
   Server Subnet VIPs (randomly assigned)
   NFS1   A      VIP2
   NFS2   A      VIP3
   NFS3   A      VIP1

   NFS1   B      VIP4
   NFS2   B      VIP6
   NFS3   B      VIP5

   If the cluster's NFS nodes have multiple network interface cards (NICs)
   connected to different subnets, you should restrict VIP assignment to
   the NICs that are on the correct subnet: for each NFS server, choose
   whichever MAC address is on the subnet from which the cluster will be
   NFS-mounted, then add it to the list.
   Warning: If you add a VIP that is not accessible on the subnet, then
   failover will not work. Also, do not use duplicate MAC addresses. For
   example, for bonding interfaces on the cluster nodes, do not use the
   same MAC address for bond0 and bond0.X, as then the failover of VIP
   might not work.

   You can only set up VIPs for failover between network interfaces that
   are in the same subnet. In large clusters with multiple subnets, you
   can set up multiple groups of VIPs to provide NFS failover for the
   different subnets.

   VIPs are evenly distributed across NFS nodes. For example, if six VIP
   addresses are available for three NFS servers, two VIPs are assigned to
   each server. If the previous example did not have two separate subnets,
   the six VIP addresses might be assigned like this:
     Server  VIPs (randomly assigned)
   N/FS1     VIP1, VIP3

   NFS2
   VIP4, VIP5
   NFS3      VIP2, VIP6

   The following sections describe how to set up, edit, and remove VIPs
   using the MapR Control System and the CLI.
