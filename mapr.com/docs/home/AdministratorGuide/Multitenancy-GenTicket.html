Generating a Ticket for a Tenant

   Tenant tickets allow tenant users to access the tenant volume on the
   cluster (when you have a [1]multi-tenant environment on MapR
   Filesystem). Generate the tenant ticket on the cluster and copy it to
   the tenant host(s) to grant tenant users access to the provisioned
   storage.
   To generate a tenant ticket, run one of the following commands on the
   cluster:
$ maprlogin generateticket -type tenant -cluster <cluster_name> -user <tenant_ad
min_user> -duration <seconds> -out <ticket_file_path>.txt

   Note: For more information, see the [2]maprlogin command.
   By default:
     * Tenant ticket is stored in /tmp and can only be read by that user.
       To change the default location, specify the path to the desired
       location with the out parameter.
     * Tenant ticket has no expiration. To change the expiration time,
       specify duration for the ticket with the command.

   In the tenant tickets, the value for CanImpersonate and tenant will
   always be true. For example, when you run the maprlogin print command,
   your output should look similar to the following:
Opening keyfile /user/clstrAdmin/tenant_user_ticket.txt
tenantHost: user = tenant_user, created = 'Mon Jul 11 07:14:53 UTC 2016',
expires = 'Mon Jul 11 07:14:53 UTC 12016', RenewalTill = 'Mon Jul 11 07:14:53 UT
C 12016',
uid = 500, gids = 500, 42, CanImpersonate = true, tenant = true

   To grant access to tenant users, the tenant ticket must be copied over
   to the tenant hosts.
   After generating the ticket, do the following:
    1. Reset the permissions on the ticket to grant the tenant admin read
       permissions on the ticket.
    2. Move the ticket out of the default /tmp directory to a secure
       location on the tenant host(s).
