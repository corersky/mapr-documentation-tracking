Guidelines for Setting Mirror Schedules

   Although MapR allows mirroring frequencies up to once per minute,
   setting a schedule at this frequency is not practical nor advisable.
   When you choose the mirror schedule, consider the amount of data on the
   volume and the load on the cluster. Remember that the mirroring
   frequency must allow enough time to complete one mirror operation
   before the next scheduled mirror operation starts. In addition, if you
   have a cascaded mirror setup (where A mirrors to B which mirrors to C),
   you cannot set a mirror schedule for C that starts before B finishes
   mirroring from A.
   Warning: In general, you should not set a mirror schedule for more
   often than every 30 minutes.

   If you set a mirror schedule to start mirroring before the previous
   mirror operation finishes, you will see an error message similar to
   this:
WARN Alarms [pool-2-thread-1]: Alarm raised: VOLUME_ALARM_MIRROR_FAILURE; Cluste
r: Cluster1; Volume: ; Message: Cannot start new scheduled mirror because existi
ng mirror is in progress
