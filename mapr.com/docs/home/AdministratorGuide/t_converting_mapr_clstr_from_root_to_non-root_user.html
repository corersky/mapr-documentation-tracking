Converting a MapR Cluster from Root to Non-Root User from the Command-Line

    1. Create a user with the same UID/GID across the cluster. Assign that
       user to the MAPR_USER environment variable.
    2. On each node:
         a. Stop the warden and the ZooKeeper (if present).
# service mapr-warden stop
# service mapr-zookeeper stop
         b. Run the config-mapr-user.sh script to configure the cluster to
            start as the non-root user.
# /opt/mapr/server/config-mapr-user.sh -u <MapR user> [-g <MapR group>]
         c. Start the ZooKeeper (if present) and the warden.
# service mapr-zookeeper start
# service mapr-warden start
    3. After the previous step is complete on all nodes in the cluster,
       run the upgrade2mapruser.sh script on all nodes.
# /opt/mapr/server/upgrade2mapruser.sh
       This command may take several minutes to return. The script waits
       ten minutes for the process to complete across the entire cluster.
       If the cluster-wide operation takes longer than ten minutes, the
       script fails. Re-run the script on all nodes where the script
       failed.
       Warning: The MAPR_UID_MISMATCH alarm may raise during this process.
       The alarm will clear when this process is complete on all nodes.
