Working with Multiple Instances of the MapR-FS

   The Multi-MFS feature allows multiple instances of the FileServer to
   run on a single node in a single process.

   Multiple instances of the MapR FileServer can run on a single node in a
   single process with the installation of MapR-XD or the MapR-DB
   software. On servers with SSDs with at least 2 storage pools (SP), two
   instances (per node) are configured by default. On servers without
   SSDs, a single instance is configured by default. Each instance runs as
   a separate library that is dynamically loaded into a single process. In
   this mode, each instance has a separate host ID; however, all of the
   instances share the same hostname.

   The maximum number of supported instances is 32. Instances should be
   configured based on the available CPU, memory, disks, and SPs. Each
   instance will need minimum of 2GB and instances should not exceed:
     * Number of CPUs / 2
     * Number of SPs (enforced)

File Server Instances

   On MapR-XD and MapR-DB installations, nodes with SSDs can run multiple
   FileServer instances. To determine whether a node has SSDs, MapR uses
   the value of mfs.disk.is.ssd in [1]mfs.conf file, which must be set to
   1.

   For clusters with MapR-XD or MapR-DB license, if mfs.disk.is.ssd in
   [2]mfs.conf file is set to 1, CLDB configures nodes with SSDs to have 2
   FileServer instances by default. On homogeneous clusters, you can
   modify the number of instances by [3]changing the value of
   multimfs.numsps.perinstance parameter.

Ports for Multi-MFS

   Each instance listens on its own set of ports. Ensure that the ports
   are open for this feature. For example, instance 0 will use four ports
   from 5660, 5692 (5660+32), 5724 (5660+64), and 5756 (5660+96), instance
   1 will use four ports from 5661, 5693, 5725, 5757, and so on for every
   additional instance. The topology of all instances is the same.

   To verify that these ports are open, run the following command from a
   remote machine:
mrconfig -i -h <ip> -p <port number> info threads

   An error indicates that the port is not open. If a port (for example,
   port 5661) is blocked, this command will print something similar to the
   following:
------------------
|From Instance 5661::|
------------------
<...> rpc failed <...>

Log Files

   Each instance has its own set of log files in $MAPR_HOME/logs. When
   multiple instances are configured, the log files have the same name
   with a different instance ID; for example, mfs.log.<N>-3 where N is the
   instance number.
   Note: For the primary instance, the log file name does not include the
   instance number.

   The RPC and security trace information are in a separate file per
   instance, mfs-<N>.err, where N is the instance number. For the primary
   instance, the file name does not include the instance number.

   For example, suppose there are 2 instances running on ports 5660 and
   5661. There will be 2 sets of log files, one per instance:
     * mfs.log-3 for the primary instance
     * mfs.log.1-3 for the second instance

   The RPC and security trace information will be in these files:
     * mfs.err for the primary instance
     * mfs-1.err for the second instance
