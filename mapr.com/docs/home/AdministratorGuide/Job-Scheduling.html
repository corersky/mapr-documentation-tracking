Job Scheduling

   You can use job scheduling to prioritize the YARN applications that run
   on your MapR cluster.

   The MapReduce system supports a minimum of one queue, named default.
   Hence, this parameter's value should always contain the string default.
   Some job schedulers, like the Capacity Scheduler, support multiple
   queues.

   The default job scheduler is the Fair Scheduler, which is designed for
   a production environment with multiple users or groups that compete for
   cluster resources.

   The MapR Converged Data Platform supports these job schedulers:
     * FIFO queue-based scheduler: The FIFO queue scheduler runs jobs
       based on the order in which the jobs were submitted. You can
       prioritize a job by changing the value of the mapred.job.priority
       property or by calling the setJobPriority() method.
     * Fair Scheduler: This is the default scheduler. The Fair Scheduler
       allocates a share of cluster capacity to each user over time. The
       design goal of the Fair Scheduler is to assign resources to jobs so
       that each job receives an equal share of resources over time. The
       Fair Scheduler enforces fair sharing within each queue. Running
       jobs share the queue's resources.
     * Capacity Scheduler: The Capacity Scheduler enables users or
       organizations to simulate an individual hadoop cluster with FIFO
       scheduling for each user or organization. You can define
       organizations using queues.
