Java APIs

   You can set, retrieve, and remove extended attributes on files,
   directories, and FUSE mounted file path using [1]Extended Attribute
   Java APIs.

Set Extended Attributes

   To set extended attributes, use the following APIs:

   public void setXAttr(Path path, String name, byte[] value) throws
          IOException
          Set an extended attribute on a file or directory. The name must
          be prefixed with the namespace followed by ".". For example,
          "user.attr". By default, if a given extended attribute exists,
          then it will be replaced with the new one.

   public void setXAttr(Path path, String name, byte[] value,
          Enum<SetXAttrSetFlag> flag) throws IOException
          Set an extended attribute on a file or directory. The name must
          be prefixed with the namespace followed by ".". For example,
          "user.attr". The XAttrSetFlag value can be:

          + CREATE to create a new extended attribute. An error is
            returned if an extended attribute with the given name already
            exists.
          + REPLACE to replace an existing extended attribute. An error is
            returned if the specified extended attribute does not already
            exist.

Retrieve Extended Attributes

   To retrieve extended attributes, use the following APIs:

   public byte[] getXAttr(Path path, String name) throws IOException
          Get an extended attribute name and value for a file or
          directory. The name must be prefixed with the namespace followed
          by ".". For example, "user.attr".

   public Map<String,byte[]> getXAttrs(Path path) throws IOException
          Get all the extended attribute name/value pairs for a file or
          directory. Only those extended attributes which the logged-in
          user has permissions to view are returned.

   public Map<String,byte[]> getXAttrs(Path path, List<String> names)
          throws IOException
          Get the extended attributes specified by the given list of
          names. Only those extended attributes which the logged-in user
          has permissions to view are returned.

   public List<String> listXAttrs(Path path) throws IOException
          Get all the extended attribute names for a file or directory.
          Only those extended attribute names which the logged-in user has
          permissions to view are returned.

Remove Extended Attributes

   To remove an extended attribute associated with a file or directory,
   use the following API:

   public void removeXAttr(Path path, String name) throws IOException
          Remove an extended attribute of a file or directory. The name
          must be prefixed with the namespace followed by ".". For
          example, "user.attr".
