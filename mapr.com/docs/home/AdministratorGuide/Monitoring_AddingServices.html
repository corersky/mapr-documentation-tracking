Configure Monitoring for Additional Services

   When you add services to a cluster where MapR Monitoring is already
   configured, you must restart collectd and Fluentd services to enable
   the collection of logs and metrics for the newly added services.
    1. Restart the collectd service on each node that runs the service
       that was added to the cluster.
maprcli node services -name collectd -nodes <space separated list of hostname/IP
addresses> -action restart

    2. Restart the Fluentd service on each node that runs the service that
       was added to the cluster.
maprcli node services -name fluentd -nodes <space separated list of hostname/IPa
ddresses> -action restart
