Enabling or Disabling Upload to MapR Server

   You can agree to (enable) or turn off (disable) automatic upload of
   metrics to the MapR server using the MapR Control System (MCS) and the
   CLI.
   If the cluster is connected to the internet, automatic upload of
   metrics is enabled by default. If the cluster is not connected to the
   internet, disable automatic upload of data and follow the steps to
   [1]upload metering data manually.

Enabling or Disabling Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Auditing and Metering tab in the Admin
       > Cluster Settings page.
    2. Move the slider to Yes to enable or No to disable in the Send
       Metering Metrics to MapR section.

Enabling or Disabling Using the CLI

   Set the value for mcs.metering.upload.data to 0 to disable and 1 to
   enable by running the following command.
maprcli config save -values '{"mcs.metering.upload.data":"1"}'
