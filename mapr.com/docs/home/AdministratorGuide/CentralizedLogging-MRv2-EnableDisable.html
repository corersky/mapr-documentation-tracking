Enabling Centralized Logging for MapReduce Version 2

   As of 4.0.2, you can use centralized logging for MapReduce version 2
   applications but it is disabled by default. In 4.0.1, centralized
   logging is not supported for MRv2 applications.
   Configure the yarn.use-central-logging-for-mapreduce-only property in
   the yarn-site.xml file to enable or disable centralized logging.
   The yarn-site.xml file is located in the following directory:
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/etc/hadoop/.
     * To disable centralized logging, remove the property
       yarn.use-central-logging-for-mapreduce-only from the yarn-site.xml
       or set the value of yarn.use-central-logging-for-mapreduce-only to
       false in yarn-site.xml.
     * To enable centralized logging, set the value of
       yarn.use-central-logging-for-mapreduce-only to true in
       yarn-site.xml. If you enable centralized logging while applications
       are running, restart all ResourceManagers. In a production cluster,
       restart ResoureManagers one at a time to prevent interruption to
       the applications running. The applications running during this
       process may not have centralized logging enabled.
