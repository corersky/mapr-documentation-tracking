Working with Snapshots

   This section provide information about working with snapshots.

   A snapshot is a read-only image of a volume at a specific point in
   time. On clusters with an Enterprise Edition or higher license, you can
   create a snapshot manually or automate the process with a schedule.
   Snapshots are useful any time you need to be able to roll back to a
   known good data set at a specific point in time. For example, before
   performing a risky operation on a volume, you can create a snapshot to
   enable rollback capability for the entire volume.
   A snapshot takes no time to create, and initially uses no disk space,
   because it stores only the incremental changes needed to roll the
   volume back to the state at the time the snapshot was created. The
   storage used by a volume's snapshots does not count against the
   volume's quota. When you view the list of volumes on your cluster in
   the MapR Control System, the value of the Snap Size column is the disk
   space used by all of the snapshots for that volume.
   Note: Snapshot volumes inherit the auditing configurations of their
   original read-write volumes. For details about auditing, see
   [1]Auditing.

   You can perform the following tasks using the MapR Control System and
   the CLI.
