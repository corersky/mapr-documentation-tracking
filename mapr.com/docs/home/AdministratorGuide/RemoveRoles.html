Removing Roles from a Node

   You can remove roles from nodes in the MapR cluster. The process of
   removing a role from a node depends on the role type.
   Once you remove a role from a node, you must restart Warden. Observe
   the following best practices when restarting Warden on nodes that were
   ZooKeeper or CLDB nodes:
     * Perform a rolling restart of Warden to ensure that all services are
       up. A rolling restart of Warden means restart Warden on each node,
       one at a time, pausing until the last restart finishes before
       beginning the next.
     * To avoid a failover from occurring, identify nodes running critical
       services, such as ResourceManager, and restart Warden last on those
       nodes.
     * Restart Warden on nodes that run critical cluster services, such as
       ResourceManager, during periods of low activity.
