Using MapR Monitoring (Spyglass Initiative)

   MapR Monitoring (part of the Spyglass initiative) provides the ability
   to collect, store, and view metrics and logs for nodes, services, and
   jobs/applications.

Metric Monitoring

   Administrators can monitor the current status of the cluster and
   anticipate future cluster requirements with dashboards. For example,
   you can use metrics dashboards to visualize the following:

   Storage Utilization
          Use metrics dashboards to monitor storage trends. For example,
          you can compare the volume of MapR-FS usage at different times
          to the MapR-FS capacity and then allocate resources to the
          MapR-FS accordingly.

   Node Utilization
          Use metrics dashboards to check for node overload. For example,
          if the CPU usage is high on a few nodes, you may want to
          distribute the load across more nodes for better performance and
          efficiency.

   MapR-DB Operational Trends
          Use metrics dashboards to display historical trends for MapR-DB
          operations. For example, if a user reports MapR-DB slowness, the
          historical trends associated with row scans, get, and put
          operations can be used to identify the node(s) on which the
          performance degradation occurs.

Log Monitoring

   Administrators can use dashboards to visualize, search, and review logs
   when troubleshooting issues. For example, you can use log dashboards to
   troubleshoot the following issues:

   Service Failures
          When metrics indicate that one or more services are down, use
          log dashboards to check the logs for each failed service and
          drill-down to each associated node.

   Application Failures
          When an application or job fails, use log dashboard to identify
          possible bottlenecks. For example, you can search the logs for a
          given application ID across all the nodes in the cluster.

   MapR-FS Performance
          When users experience MapR-FS or NFS slowness, use log
          dashboards to search the MapR file system logs for service
          errors or application issues.
