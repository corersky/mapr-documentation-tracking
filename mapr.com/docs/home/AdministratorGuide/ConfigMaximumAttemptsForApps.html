Configuring Maximum Attempts for Applications

   When an ApplicationMaster fails, the ResourceManager restarts the
   ApplicationMaster as long as the number of restart attempts does not
   exceed the max-attempt values set at the ResourceManager and
   ApplicationMaster level . By default, the maximum attempt value is set
   to 2.
     * To configure the maximum number of ApplicationMaster attempt
       retries for all applications run by the ResourceManager:
       Set the value of yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-attempts in
       yarn-site.xml. The value defaults to 2.
     * To configure the number of ApplicationMaster attempts allowed for
       the MapReduce ApplicationMaster:
       Set the value of mapreduce.am.max-attempts in mapred-site.xml. The
       value defaults to 2.
