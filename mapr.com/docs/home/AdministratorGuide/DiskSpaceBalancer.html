Disk Space Balancer

   The disk space balancer is a tool that balances disk space usage on a
   cluster by moving containers between nodes (subject to the constraints
   of the topology of the volume to which a container belongs). This
   movement of containers ensures that the percentage of space used on all
   the disks in the cluster is similar. The disk space balancer balances
   at the level of storage pools (SPs), keeping them at the same
   utilization level as the cluster average.
   Note:
     * Utilization Level of a SP = (Used space of the SP / Storage
       capacity of the SP)
     * Cluster Average = (Used space across all SPs / Capacity of all SPs)

   The disk space balancer distributes containers from highly utilized
   storage pools on one node in a cluster to less utilized storage pools
   on other nodes in the same cluster. It accomplishes this by first
   classifying storage pools into different bins (based on their
   utilization level). It checks every storage pool on a regular basis
   (every 2 minutes by default) and then classifies storage pools into
   bins based on their percentage utilization.

   After classifying the storage pools into bins, the disk space balancer
   then moves containers (in two phases) out of the storage pools with
   more containers to storage pools with fewer containers. That is, it
   moves containers out of storage pools in higher bins to storage pools
   in lower bins in two phases:
     * Phase 1 — storage pools in ‘Overused’ and ‘Above Average’ bins are
       balanced.
     * Phase 2 — storage pools in ‘Average’ and ‘Below Average’ bins are
       balanced.
       Note: Movement of containers in phase 2 happens only when there are
       not many containers scheduled to be moved in phase 1, because
       movement of container at any point in time is throttled.

   In both phases, the disk balancer attempts to move containers from
   storage pools in the highest utilized bin (the source SP) to suitable
   storage pools in the lowest utilized bin (the destination SP). If a
   suitable SP could not be found as the destination, the balancer
   attempts to move a container to the next least utilized bin. An SP is
   not deemed suitable as the destination if:
     * Moving a container to that SP would cause the SP to move to the
       next bin.
     * Data movement into the file server to which the SP belongs is
       blocked.
     * SP is not in the same topology as specified by the volume.
     * Certain number of containers are currently being moved into the SP.
       Note: The number of simultaneous moves to a SP is capped at 2.
     * SP is in the same bin as the source SP.
     * Many containers of a container group associated with the same
       tiering-enabled volume reside on the SP.
       This ensures that containers of a container group associated with a
       tiering-enabled volume are distributed evenly across SPs and do not
       gather in a few SPs. The balancer accomplishes this by determining
       whether the destination SP has containers from the container group
       for the volume associated with the container identified for move to
       the destination SP.

   An SP or its containers are not considered for balancing if:
     * Data movement from the file server to which the SP belongs is
       blocked.
     * Container was active (i.e., written to) in the previous 5 minutes.
     * Containers were deleted in the previous minute.
       This is to allow space reclamation. If necessary, the bin will be
       balanced during the next iteration of the disk balancer.
     * Percentage of data that is being transferred out of an SP is
       greater than or equal to 2% of the SP’s storage capacity.
     * Certain number of containers are currently being moved out of the
       SP.
       Note: The number of simultaneous moves out of an SP is capped at 2.

Sample Disk Balancer Settings for Organization of Bins

   The following example illustrates disk balancer settings and the
   corresponding organization of bins to represent storage pool
   utilization:

   In the above example, the:
    1. Average cluster space utilization is 65%.
    2. Average bin size is 10%. Hence, the average bin spans 5% on each
       side of the average space utilization.
    3. Overused threshold is 90%.
    4. Below average bin size is 20%.
       Below average bin utilization is partitioned into required number
       of bins (3). During division, the bin that is immediately to the
       left of the average bin might not span the default value. In other
       words, if the average bin spans from 50% to 60%, the below average
       bins will be cast as 0-20%, 20-40%, 40-50%.
    5. Above average bin size is 10%.
       Since the overused threshold is 90%, the above average bins span
       the utilization from the right boundary of the average bin up to
       the overused threshold. As with below average bins, as many
       possible bins are cast with the size of the above average bin,
       leaving the remaining utilization to be covered by the last
       (right-most) above average bin.
