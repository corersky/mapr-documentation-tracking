Creating Remote Mirrors

   Creating remote mirrors is similar to creating local mirrors, except
   that the mirror volume resides in a different cluster from the source
   volume. To properly identify the source volume, the source cluster name
   must also be specified when the mirror volume is created. In addition,
   you must edit the mapr-clusters.conf file so that each cluster can
   resolve the nodes in the other cluster.

   To create a mirror on a remote cluster, you must have the same UID for
   the MAPR_USER (the cluster owner) for both the primary cluster (where
   the source volume resides) and the remote clusters (where the mirror
   volumes reside; also known as the destination clusters). You also need
   to have these volume permissions:
     * dump permission on the source volumes
     * restore permission on the mirror volumes at the destination
       clusters

   When a mirror volume is created on a remote cluster (according to the
   entries in the mapr-clusters.conf file), the CLDB checks that the local
   volume exists in the local cluster. If both clusters are not set up and
   running, the remote mirror volume cannot be created.

   To summarize:
     * Each cluster must be already set up and running
     * Each cluster must have a unique name
     * Every node in each cluster must be able to resolve all nodes in
       remote clusters, either through DNS or entries in /etc/hosts
     * The UID for the MAPR_USER (cluster owner) must be the same for the
       source and destination clusters, irrespective of which user account
       triggers the mirror operation.
     * Volume permission must be set to dump on the source volumes
     * Volume permission must be set to restore on the mirror volumes
