   RPCs completed
   Throughput - Row count written mapr.db.append_rpcrows ^1 The number of
   rows written by append RPCs
   mapr.db.checkandput_rpcrows ^1 The number of rows written by check and
   put RPCs
   mapr.db.increment_rpcrows ^1 The number of rows written by increment
   RPCs
   mapr.db.put_rpcrows The number of rows written by put RPCs. Each MapR
   Database put RPC can include multiple put rows.
   mapr.db.updateandget_rpcrows ^1 The number of rows written by update
   and get RPCs
   Throughput - Rows returned mapr.db.get_resprows ^1 The number of rows
   returned from get RPCs
   mapr.db.scan_resprows ^1 The number of rows returned from scan RPCs
   Throughput - Row count read mapr.db.get_readrows ^1 The number of rows
   read by get RPCs
   mapr.db.put_readrows ^1 The number of rows read by put RPCs
   mapr.db.scan_readrows ^1 The number of rows read by scan RPCs
   Throughput - Bytes written mapr.db.append_bytes ^1 The number of bytes
   written by append RPCs
   mapr.db.checkandput_bytes ^1 The number of bytes written by check and
   put RPCs
   mapr.db.put_bytes The number of bytes written by put RPCs
   mapr.db.increment_bytes ^1 The number of bytes written by increment
   RPCs
   mapr.db.updateandget_bytes ^1 The number of bytes written by update and
   get RPCs
   Throughput - Bytes read mapr.db.get_bytes ^1 The number of bytes read
   by get RPCs
   mapr.db.scan_bytes ^1 The number of bytes read by scan RPCs
   Value cache usage mapr.db.valuecache_hits The number of MapR Database
   operations that utilized the MapR Database value cache
   mapr.db.valuecache_lookups The number of MapR Database operations that
   performed a lookup on the MapR Database value cache
   mapr.db.valuecache_usedSize The MapR Database value cache size in MB
   Compactions mapr.db.fullcompacts ^1

   The number of compactions that combine multiple MapR Database data
   files containing sorted data (known as spills) into a single spill
   file.

   MapR Database creates a spill file each time it flushes files
   containing unsorted data (known as buckets). Full compactions improve
   read performance because after compaction, MapR Database needs to read
   only the single resulting sorted spill file. But they incur I/O costs
   because the compaction must read, sort, and rewrite all data in the
   spill files.
   mapr.db.minicompacts ^1

   The number of compactions that combine multiple small data files
   containing sorted data (known as spills) into a single spill file.

   MapR Database creates a spill file each time it flushes files
   containing unsorted data (known as buckets). After a mini compaction,
   MapR Database needs to read only two spill files.
   mapr.db.ttlcompacts ^1

   The number of compactions that result in reclamation of disk space due
   to removal of stale data.

   You can configure the TTL for a table if it has only a default column
   family. See [1]table cf edit for details.
   Table flushes mapr.db.flushes ^1 The number of flushes that reorganize
   data from bucket files (unsorted data) to spill files (sorted data)
   when the bucket size exceeds a threshold
   mapr.db.forceflushes ^1 The number of flushes that reorganize data from
   bucket files (unsorted data) to spill files (sorted data) when the
   in-memory bucket file cache fills up
   CDC - Data sent mapr.db.cdc.sent_bytes ^1 The number of bytes of CDC
   data sent
   mapr.db.cdc.sent_rows ^1 The number of rows of CDC data sent
   Secondary indexes - Data sent mapr.db.index.sent_bytes ^1 The number of
   bytes sent for secondary index updates
   mapr.db.index.sent_rows ^1 The number of rows sent for secondary index
   updates
   Replication - Data sent mapr.db.repl.sent_bytes ^1 The number of bytes
   sent to replicate data
   mapr.db.repl.sent_rows ^1 The number of rows sent to replicate data
   CDC - Data pending mapr.db.cdc.pending_bytes ^1 The number of bytes of
   CDC data remaining to be sent
   mapr.db.cdc.pending_rows ^1 The number of rows of CDC data remaining to
   be sent
   Secondary indexes - Data pending mapr.db.index.pending_bytes ^1 The
   number of bytes of secondary index data remaining to be sent
   mapr.db.index.pending_rows ^1 The number of rows of secondary index
   data remaining to be sent
   Replication - Data pending mapr.db.repl.pending_bytes ^1 The number of
   bytes of replication data remaining to be sent
   mapr.db.repl.pending_rows ^1 The number of rows of replication data
   remaining to be sent

   ^1 Available starting in MapR 6.1
