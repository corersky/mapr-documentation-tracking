Adding Cluster Permissions

   You can set cluster permissions for users and groups through the MapR
   Control System and the CLI.

   The following table lists the actions a user can perform on a cluster
   with the corresponding UI columns and codes used in the cluster ACL:
           UI

   ACL

   Allowed Action
   Login

   login

   Log in to the MapR Control System, use the API and command-line
   interface, read access on cluster and volumes
   Start/Stop Service

   ss

   Start and stop services.
   Create Volumes

   cv

   Create volumes.
   Administrator

   a

   Administrative access (can edit and view ACLs, but cannot perform
   cluster operations).
   Full Control

   fc

   Full control over the cluster. This enables all cluster-related
   administrative options with the exception of changing the cluster ACLs.

Setting Permissions Using the MapR Control System

   Complete the following steps to add cluster permissions in the MapR
   Control System:
    1. Log in to MCS and click Admin > User Settings > Permissions.
    2. Under USER PERMISSIONS, select the type and specify the name of the
       user or group in the Name field.
    3. Select the checkbox associated with the permissions you want to
       grant to the user or group.
    4. Click Add Another to add permissions for another user or group.
       Each row lets you assign permissions to a single user or group.
       Note: A user gets the permissions directly granted to the user as
       well as permissions granted to any group to which the user belongs.
    5. Click Save Changes to save the changes.

Setting Permissions Using the CLI or the REST API

   To set permissions using the CLI, run the following command:
maprcli acl set
    [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
    [ -group <group> ]
    [ -name <name> ]
    -type cluster|volume
    [ -user <user> ]

   See [1]acl set for complete reference information.

Granting a User Full Control from the Command-Line

   The user who has full control over the cluster can manage aspects of
   the cluster except assign permissions for other users.

   Complete the following steps to give full administrative control to a
   user:
    1. Log on to any cluster node as root (or use sudo).
    2. Execute the following command, replacing <user> with the username
       of the account that gets administrative control: sudo
       /opt/mapr/bin/maprcli acl edit -type cluster -user <user>:fc
       For general information about users and groups in the cluster, see
       [2]Managing Users and Groups.
