7. Start the Nodes

   Perform the following steps on the node you have selected for
   installation of the CLDB:
   Start the Warden:
service mapr-warden start

   After the CLDB restarts, there is a 15-minute delay before replication
   resumes, in order to allow all nodes to register and heartbeat. This
   delay can be configured using the [1]config save command to set the
   cldb.replication.manager.start.mins parameter.
