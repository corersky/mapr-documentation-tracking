Volume Topology

   The topology describes the locations of nodes and racks in the cluster.
   Volume topology is based on node topology. You define volume topology
   after you define node topology. When you set up node topology, you can
   group nodes by rack or switch. MapR-FS uses node topology to determine
   where to replicate data for continuous access to the data in the event
   of a rack or node failure.

   A volumeâ€™s topology defines which racks or nodes a volume includes.

   The following image represents a volume that spans a cluster:

Topology of Local Volume Replicas

   The master copies for containers of local volumes are placed on the
   local node. The nodes for the replica copies for containers of local
   volumes are chosen in the following order:
    1. If a topology is explicitly specified for replicas during volume
       creation or modification, that topology will be used.
    2. If the configuration parameter that specifies a relative path for
       replicas of local volumes is set, that will be used.
    3. The default volume topology will be used.

   See [1]Setting the Topology for Local Volume Replicas, [2]Creating
   Replicas of Local Volumes in Custom Topology Using the CLI, and
   [3]Setting Default Volume Topology Using the CLI.

Mirror Volume Topology

   When the root volume on a cluster is mirrored, the source root volume
   contains a writable volume link, .rw that points to the read/write
   copies of all local volumes. In that case, the mount path / refers to
   one of the root volume's mirrors, and is read-only. The mount path /.rw
   refers to the source volume, and is read/write.

   A mount path that consists entirely of mirrored volumes refers to a
   mirrored copy of the specified volume. When a mount path contains
   volumes that are not mirrored, the path refers to the target volume
   directly. In cases where a path refers to a mirrored copy, the .rw link
   is useful for navigating to the read/write source volume.

Sample Volume Topology with Mirrors

   The following example shows a volume topology with mirrors:

   For the four volumes /, a, b, and c, the following table indicates the
   volumes referred to by example mount paths for particular combinations
   of mirrored and not mirrored volumes in the path:
