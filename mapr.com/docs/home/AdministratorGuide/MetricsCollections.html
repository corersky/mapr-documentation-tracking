Metric Collection

   Metrics are collected from each node in the cluster so that
   administrators can use the data to monitor the cluster. In general, the
   collectd service collects metrics every 10 seconds. The exception is
   volume metrics which are collected every 10 minutes.

   When collectd writes metrics to streams, tags are assigned to each
   metric so that administrators can filter metric data to create
   dashboards that are specific to their needs.
   By default, each metric contains the following tags:
     * fqdn: Displays values for a specified node.
     * clusterid: Displays values for a specific cluster.
     * clustername: As of MEP 3.0, displays values for a specific cluster.

   However, many metrics have additional tags that you can use to filter
   metric data.
   Streams store metrics in OpenTSDB with the following schema:
<metrictype.name> <fqdn:fqdnvalue> <clusterid:clusteridvalue> <clustername:clust
ernamevalue>[<AdditionalTagA:AdditionalTagAvalue> <AdditionalTagB:AdditionalTagB
value>...] <metricvalue> <timestamp>

   Note: A negative value shown in the metrics indicates that the maximum
   value configured for that metric is exceeded. The maximum value for GUT
   metrics is int32 (2^31-1).

   For more information on using tags and dashboards, see [1]Metric
   Visualization.
