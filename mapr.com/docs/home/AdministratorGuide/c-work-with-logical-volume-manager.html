Working with a Logical Volume Manager

   The Logical Volume Manager creates symbolic links to each logical
   volume's block device, from a directory path in the form:
/dev/<volume group>/<volume name>

   MapR needs the actual block location, which you can find by using the
   ls -l command to list the symbolic links.
    1. Make sure you have free, unmounted logical volumes for use by MapR:
          + Unmount any mounted logical volumes that can be erased and
            used for MapR.
          + Allocate any free space in an existing logical volume group to
            new logical volumes.
    2. Make a note of the volume group and volume name of each logical
       volume.
    3. Use ls -l with the volume group and volume name to determine the
       path of each logical volume's block device. Each logical volume is
       a symbolic link to a logical block device from a directory path
       that uses the volume group and volume name:
/dev/<volume group>/<volume name>
       The following example shows output that represents a volume group
       named mapr containing logical volumes named mapr1, mapr2, mapr3,
       and mapr4:
# ls -l /dev/mapr/mapr*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Apr 12 21:48 /dev/mapr/mapr1 -> /dev/mapper/mapr-mapr1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Apr 12 21:48 /dev/mapr/mapr2 -> /dev/mapper/mapr-mapr2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Apr 12 21:48 /dev/mapr/mapr3 -> /dev/mapper/mapr-mapr3
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Apr 12 21:48 /dev/mapr/mapr4 -> /dev/mapper/mapr-mapr4
    4. Create a text file /tmp/disks.txt containing the paths to the block
       devices for the logical volumes (one path on each line). Example:
$ cat  /tmp/disks.txt
/dev/mapper/mapr-mapr1
/dev/mapper/mapr-mapr2
/dev/mapper/mapr-mapr3
/dev/mapper/mapr-mapr4
    5. Pass disks.txt to [1]disksetup.
