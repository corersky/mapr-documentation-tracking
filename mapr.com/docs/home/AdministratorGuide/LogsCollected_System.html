System Logs

   The fluentd component does not collect the following system logs by
   default because they require the configuration of additional
   permissions for the $MAPR_USER.

   CAPTION:

   Service name Parsing Method Description
   kernlog Multi-line Kernel logs from /var/log/kern.log.
   syslog Multi-line System logs from /var/log/syslog and
   /var/log/messages.
   mysql_errors Multi-line MySQL errors from /var/log/mysql/error.log.
   Note: To enable fluentd to read and parse these logs, see [1]Configure
   Which Logs to Index and also perform the following:
     * On Ubuntu and RedHat/CentOS, add $MAPR_USER to admin group.
     * On RedHat/CentOS, change the ownership of the log file so that it
       is owned by both the root user and the admin group.
