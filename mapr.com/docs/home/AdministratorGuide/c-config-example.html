Configuration Example

   This example assumes you are adding a new node to a cluster that is
   running the CLDB and ZooKeeper on three other nodes:
   node_a,node_b,node_c. To configure a new node_d, which is not a CLDB or
   ZooKeeper node, run the following command:
$ /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N my.cluster.com -C node_a,node_b,node_c -Z nod
e_a,node_b,node_c

   To configure a ZooKeeper node, use the -no-autostart option and the -Z
   option followed by the list of ZooKeeper nodes.
