MapR Topology Metrics

   Every 60 seconds, the collectd service uses a MapR plugin to gather the
   following topology metrics on each node in the cluster. Use these
   metrics to understand disk utilization across a topology or rack. By
   default, these metrics include all racks and topologies associated with
   the cluster. However, you can use tags to specify which rack(s) or
   topologies(s) to include. Note: Racks and topologies can span multiple
   nodes and one rack can be associated with multiple topologies.

   CAPTION:

   Name Description Tag
   mapr.topology.disks_total_capacity The disk capacity in gigabytes. This
   metric is available as of MEP 3.0.
     * rack_name: Display values for a specified rack.
     * topology_name: Display values for a specified topology. Provide the
       full topology path.

   mapr.topology.disks_used_capacity The amount disk space used in
   gigabytes. This metric is available as of MEP 3.0.
     * rack_name: Display values for a specified rack.
     * topology_name: Display values for a specified topology. Provide the
       full topology path.

   mapr.topology.utilization The aggregate percentage of CPU utilization.
   This metric is available as of MEP 3.0.
     * rack_name: Display values for a specified rack.
     * topology_name: Display values for a specified topology. Provide the
       full topology path.
