Moving Large Amounts of Data to a Remote Cluster Using the CLI

   You can use the [1]volume dump create command to create volume copies
   for transport on physical media. The [2]volume dump create command
   creates backup files containing the volumes, which can be reconstituted
   into mirrors at the remote cluster with the volume dump restore
   command. Associate these mirrors with their source volumes with the
   [3]volume modify command to re-establish synchronization.

   Another way to transfer large amounts of data to a remote cluster is to
   create a small cluster locally and mirror to that local cluster. Then
   move that cluster to a remote location and enlarge it by adding more
   nodes.
