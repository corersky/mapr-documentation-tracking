Registering a POSIX Client with Additional Clusters

   The first time you start the loopbacknfs service, you edit the
   mapr-loopbacknfs init script by defining the CLUSTER_NAME and CLDB_IPS
   variables, then run the script. These actions update the
   /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file.

   However, when you want to register a client with a new cluster or an
   additional cluster, you must add entries directly to the
   /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file. Editing the
   mapr-loopbacknfs script and restarting the loopbacknfs service does not
   update the mapr-clusters.conf file.
