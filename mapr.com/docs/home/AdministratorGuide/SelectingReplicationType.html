Selecting a Replication Type for High Availability

   MapR volumes, stored as pieces called containers, are replicated,
   typically three times, on separate nodes to protect data and provide
   uninterrupted access to data in the event of a node failure. Since all
   form of data is replicated, in the event of a node failure, after a
   brief delay while the failure is being detected, clients are simply
   directed to a replica, which serves as an alternative location for a
   data object, to continue normally. The latency as a result of the
   failure being detected can be reduced by adjusting the number of TCP
   retries. Furthermore, selecting a container replication type that is
   appropriate for your cluster layout allows for faster replication of
   container state, which in turn allows for retrieval of the most current
   data in the event of a node failure.

   MapR supports two types of container replication -- high-throughput or
   cascading replication, where volumes are replicated sequentially on
   intermediate and tail containers and low-latency or star replication,
   where volumes are replicated on multiple containers in parallel.
   Note: For more information, see [1]How MapR-FS and Associated Services
   Work.

   The tradeoffs between the replication types is one of latency and
   throughput. While the low-latency replication delivers relatively lower
   throughput than the high-throughput replication, the high-throughput
   replication suffers from relatively higher latencies than the
   low-latency replication. Another advantage of low-latency replication
   is that since the master container is connected to all other replica
   containers, there is no need to failover a replica container in the
   event of a failure thus reducing the duration of recovery, whereas with
   high-throughput replication, in the event of a failure of an
   intermediate container, clients may experience increased latency while
   CLDB, after detecting the failure, attempts to update the replication
   chain by making the next or tail container (whichever comes immediately
   after the failed container) as the next container in the chain.
