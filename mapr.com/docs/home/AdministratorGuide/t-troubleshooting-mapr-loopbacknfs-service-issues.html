Troubleshooting mapr-loopbacknfs Service Issues

   To debug authentication issues, follow these steps:
    1. If you receive a standard error (stderr):
          + Make sure rpcinfo/portmap is installed and/or run service
            portmap start.
          + Run service rpcbind restart.
    2. Examine the log files for error messages:
/usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/logs/loopbacknfs.log
/usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/logs/mount_local_fs.log
       Error messages in loopbacknfs.log file:

   CAPTION:

   Error Message Solution
   Refresh User tickets failed as security layer could not be initialized
   with user ticket /tmp/maprticket_0 Unset MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION in
   initscripts/mapr-loopbacknfs.
   exiting: license only allows 10 NFS/mfs server(s), currently alive=10
   If you have multiple clusters listed in the mapr-clusters.conf file on
   the client, make sure the first one listed is a MapR 4.0.2 or later
   cluster. If that is not the problem, you will probably need to purchase
   additional licenses, or reduce number of installations of the
   mapr-loopbacknfs service.
    3. Verify that settings in configuration files are correct.
          + For all clusters:
            /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/conf/mapr-clusters.conf
          + For secure clusters: MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION
    4. Check for “stale” mounts.
          + The mount_local_fs.pl script can cause the initscript wrapper
            to force unmounts of the mounted file systems.
          + Always check for stale mounts after stopping the service:
               o df -k should return instantly.
               o Use umount –f <mount_point> to force the unmount.
               o Use ps –ef | grep mount_local to confirm that the script
                 is not stuck.
