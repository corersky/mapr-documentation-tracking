Checking the ResourceManager State

   When you configure manual or automatic failover, the ResourceManager is
   either in active or standby state. Each ResourceManager has a serviceID
   that identifies the service.
   To check the state of a ResourceManager, run the following command with
   the serviceID:
yarn rmadmin -getServiceState <serviceID>

   The command returns active or standby based on the state of the
   ResourceManager associated with the serviceID that you provide.
   Note: Tip To determine the serviceIDs associated with the
   ResourceManagers in the cluster, run hadoop conf | grep
   yarn.resourcemanager.ha.rm-ids
