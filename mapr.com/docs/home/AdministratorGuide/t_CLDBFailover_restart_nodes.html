8. Restart All Nodes

   To restart all nodes in the cluster, stop each node, configure the node
   with the new CLDB and ZooKeeper addresses, and start the node.
   Complete the following steps on each node in the cluster:
    1. Stop the node.
         a. Change to the root user (or use sudo for the following
            commands).
         b. Stop the Warden:
service mapr-warden stop
    2. Configure all the nodes with the new CLDB and ZooKeeper addresses.
       The script configure.sh configures a node to be part of a MapR
       cluster, or modifies services running on an existing node in the
       cluster. You must run this script to configure a node. The script
       creates (or updates) configuration files related to the cluster and
       the services running on the node.
       Before you run configure.sh, make sure you have the hostname of the
       CLDB node and the hostnames of the ZooKeeper nodes. You can,
       optionally, specify the ports for the CLDB and ZooKeeper nodes as
       well. The default ports are:

   CAPTION:

        Service  Default Port #
       CLDB      7222
       ZooKeeper 5181
       The script configure.sh takes an optional cluster name and log
       file, the CLDB hostname, and comma-separated list of ZooKeeper host
       names or IP addresses (and optionally ports), using the following
       syntax:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C <host>[:<port>] -Z <host>[:<port>][,<host>[:<po
rt>]...] [-L <logfile>][-N <cluster name>]
       Note: Each time you specify the -Z <host>[:<port>] option, you must
       use the same order for the ZooKeeper node list. If you change the
       order for any node, the ZooKeeper leader election process will
       fail.
       Example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C r1n1.sj.us:7222 -Z r1n1.sj.us:5181,r2n1.sj.us:5
181,r3n1.sj.us:5181,r4n1.sj.us:5181,r5n1.sj.us:5181 -N MyCluster
    3. Start Warden.
service mapr-warden start
