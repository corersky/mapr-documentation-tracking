Assigning Weights in an Allocation File

   An allocation file is an XML manifest that describes queues and their
   properties, as well as certain policy defaults. The file contains these
   types of elements:

Queue Elements

   Queue elements represent queues and can contain the following elements:
     * minResources
     * maxResources
     * maxRunningApps
     * weight
     * schedulingPolicy
     * aclSubmitApps
     * aclAdministerApps
     * minSharePreemptionTimeout

   For more information on these elements, see [1]Hadoop: Fair Scheduler.
   Note: The queueMaxAppsDefault value is used for any parent queue that
   does not set a value for the maxRunningApps element.

User Elements

   User elements represent settings that govern the behavior of individual
   users. They can contain a single property, maxRunningApps, which limits
   the number of running applications for a particular user. It contains
   the following elements:
     * userMaxAppsDefault
     * queueMaxAppsDefault
     * fairSharePreemptionTimeout
     * defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy
     * queuePlacementPolicy

   For more information on these elements, see [2]Hadoop: Fair Scheduler.
   Note: If you set a value for queueMaxAppsDefault and do not set a value
   for maxRunningApps for the root queue, the value of queueMaxAppsDefault
   sets the application limit for all queues under the root queue
   hierarchy.

Example Allocation File

   See example allocation file in [3]Hadoop: Fair Scheduler.

Queue Access Control Lists

   Queue Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow administrators to control who
   may take actions on particular queues. They are configured with the
   aclSubmitApps and aclAdministerApps properties, which can be set per
   queue. Currently the only supported administrative action is killing an
   application. Anyone who has permission to administer a queue may also
   submit applications to it. These properties take values in a format
   like user1,user2 group1,group2 or group1,group2. An action on a queue
   will be permitted if its user or group is in the ACL of that queue or
   in the ACL of any of that queue's ancestors. So if queue2 is inside
   queue1, and user1 is in queue1's ACL, and user2 is in queue2's ACL,
   then both users may submit to queue2.

   For more information, see [4]Hadoop: Fair Scheduler.

   The yarn.admin.acl and yarn.acl.enable Properties
          By default on secure cluster users cannot kill jobs that are not
          theirs.

          On a secure cluster you do not need to set the yarn.acl property
          or the yarn.admin.acl property. By default, they are set as
          shown below. On unsecured clusters, these properties are not set
          by default.

<property>
  <name>yarn.acl.enable</name> >
  <value>true</value> >
</property>
<property>
  <name>yarn.admin.acl</name> >
  <value> </value> >
</property>

          The yarn.admin.acl property is set by default to " ", meaning
          that no single admin is specified on a cluster.

          To allow users to kill jobs that are not theirs or to get access
          to the logs, you need to set the yarn.admin.acl property with
          the user or group name.

   Fair and Capacity scheduler root queue admins
          For both the Fair scheduler and Capacity scheduler, the default
          values of the admins for the root queues is " " .
