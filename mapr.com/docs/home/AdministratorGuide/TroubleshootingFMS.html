Troubleshooting

Determining if a File was Uploaded

   The service externalizes the status of file uploads as an extended
   attribute on the files uploaded. Therefore, the service recovers easily
   from arbitrary crashes and restarts. Files not uploaded will be
   rediscovered and then uploaded.

   To determine if a particular file has been uploaded by the service to
   AWS S3, you can examine the extended attribute on the file as shown in
   the following example using the unsupported script printupload.sh,
   which is included in <MAPR_HOME>/filemigrate/filemigrate-1.0.0/bin/
   directory:
# /opt/mapr/filemigrate/filemigrate-1.0.0/bin/printupload.sh /tmp/afile

Ensuring that Login is Successful

   If the username and password do not work correctly, make sure that the
   following properties are configured correctly in the properties file:
     * authorized.users
     * authorized.groups

   See [1]FileMigrate.properties for information on these properties.
