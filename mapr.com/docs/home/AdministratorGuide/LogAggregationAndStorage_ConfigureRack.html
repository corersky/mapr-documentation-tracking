Configure Fluentd Services to Write to Elasticsearch Nodes on the Same Rack

   On clusters with high-density racks, ensure you have at least one
   Elasticsearch server per rack and configure each Fluentd service to
   write to Elasticsearch nodes that run on the same rack as the Fluentd
   service. This configuration minimizes the impact of log aggregation on
   other processes that run on the cluster and in particular, minimizes
   the amount of backbone bandwidth used by the log aggregation.

   Complete the following steps on each node that runs the Fluentd
   service.
    1. Open the
       /opt/mapr/fluentd/fluentd-<version>/etc/fluentd/es_config.conf
       file.
    2. Edit the hosts property to only include Elasticsearch nodes that
       are on the same rack as the Fluentd service.
       Example:
hosts qa-node90:9200,qa-node91.qa.lab:9200,qa-node92.qa.lab:9200
    3. Restart Fluentd.
maprcli node services -name fluentd -nodes <space separated list of fluentd node
s> -action restart

   Warning: Changes to the es_config.conf files are overridden by
   configure.sh. Therefore, you will need reconfigure the hosts property
   in the es_config.conf file after configure.sh is run on Fluentd nodes.
