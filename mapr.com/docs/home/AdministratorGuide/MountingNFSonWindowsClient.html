Mounting NFS on a Windows Client

   To set up the Windows NFS client, mount the cluster, map a network
   drive, and configure the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID). The Windows
   client must access NFS using a valid UID and GID from the Linux domain.
   Mismatched UID or GID will result in permissions problems when
   MapReduce jobs try to access files that were copied from Windows over
   an NFS share.
   Note: Because of Windows directory caching, there may appear to be no
   .snapshot directory in each volume's root directory. As a workaround,
   force Windows to re-load the volume's root directory by updating its
   modification time (for example, by creating an empty file or directory
   in the volume's root directory).
   Note: With Windows NFS clients, use the -o nolockoption on the NFS
   server to prevent the Linux NLM from registering with the portmapper.
   The native Linux NLM conflicts with the MapR NFS server.

   Complete the following steps to mount NFS on a Windows client:
    1. Mount the Cluster.
          + [1]Windows 10 Enterprise
          + [2]Windows 7 Enterprise
          + [3]Other Versions of Windows
       Complete the following steps for Windows 10 Enterprise
         a. Open Start > Control Panel > Programs.
         b. Select Turn Windows features on or off.
         c. Select Services for NFS.
         d. Click OK.
         e. Enable write permissions for the anonymous user because the
            default options only grant read permissions when mounting a
            UNIX share using the anonymous user.
            To grant write permissions, make a change to the Windows
            registry by performing the following steps:
              i. Open regedit by typing it in the search box and pressing
                 Enter.
             ii. Create a new New DWORD (32-bit) Value inside the
                 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\Curren
                 tVersion\Default folder named AnonymousUid and
                 AnonymousGid and assign the UID and GID found on the UNIX
                 directory as shared by the NFS system.
         f. Restart the NFS client or reboot the machine to apply the
            changes.
         g. Mount the cluster and map it to a drive using the Map Network
            Drive tool or from the command line.
mount -o anon usa-node01:/mapr z:
            For more information, see step 2 below.
       Complete the following steps for Windows 7 Ultimate or Windows 7
       Enterprise
         a. Open Start > Control Panel > Programs.
         b. Select Turn Windows features on or off.
         c. Select Services for NFS.
         d. Click OK.
         e. Mount the cluster and map it to a drive using the Map Network
            Drive tool or from the command line.
mount -o nolock usa-node01:/mapr z:
            For more information, see step 2 below.
       Complete the following steps for all other versions of Windows:
         a. Download and install Microsoft Windows Services for Unix
            (SFU). You only need to install the NFS Client and the User
            Name Mapping.
         b. Configure the user authentication in SFU to match the
            authentication used by the cluster (LDAP or operating system
            users). You can map local Windows users to cluster Linux
            users, if desired.
         c. Once SFU is installed and configured, mount the cluster and
            map it to a drive using the Map Network Drive tool or from the
            command line.
mount -o nolock usa-node01:/mapr z:
            For more information, see step 2 below.
    2. Map a network drive with the Map Network Drive tool.
         a. Open Start > My Computer.
         b. Select Tools > Map Network Drive.
         c. In the Map Network Drive window, choose an unused drive letter
            from the Drive drop-down list.
         d. Specify the Folder by browsing for the MapR cluster, or by
            typing the hostname and directory into the text field.
         e. Browse for the MapR cluster or type the name of the folder to
            map. This name must follow UNC. Alternatively, click the
            Browseâ€¦ button to find the correct folder by browsing
            available network shares.
         f. Select Reconnect at login to reconnect automatically to the
            MapR cluster whenever you log into the computer.
         g. Click Finish.
    3. Configure the UID and GID for NFS access.
          + [4]System that is part of Active Directory Domain
          + [5]System not using Active Directory
       For a system that is part of the Active Directory Domain, you must
       instruct the NFS client to access an AD server to get uidNumber and
       gidNumber.
         a. Ensure the AD Users schema has auxiliary class posixAccount.
         b. Populate AD uidNumber and gidNumber fields with matching uid
            and gid from Linux.
         c. Configure the NFS client to look up uid and gid in the AD DS
            store.
         d. Refer to details here:
            http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh509016(v=ws.10).a
            spx.
       For a standalone Windows 7 or Vista machine (not using Active
       Directory), Windows always uses its configured Anonymous UID and
       GID for NFS access, which by default are -2. However, you can
       configure Windows to use specific values, which results in being
       able to access NFS using those values.
       The UID and GID values are set in the Windows Registry and are
       global on the Windows NFS client box. This solution might not work
       well if your Windows box has multiple users who each need access to
       NFS with their own permissions, but there is no obvious way to
       avoid this limitation.
       The values are stored in the registry path
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\D
       efault. The two DWORD values are AnonymousUid and AnonymousGid. If
       they do not exist, you must create them.

    4. (Optional) Deactivate the nlockmgr service.
       If the nlockmgr service is active on a Windows machine, attempts to
       mount a MapR NFS share fail with the following message:
C:\Users\administrator.Client1>mount -o nolock -u:mapr -p:mapr ClusterNode1:/map
r / g:
Network Error - 53
Type 'NET HELPMSG 53' for more information.
         a. Run the rpcinfo command to confirm that the nlockmgr service
            is active.
C:\Users\administrator.Client1>rpcinfo -p ClusterNode1
program version protocol     port
--------------------------------------------------
100000       4      tcp      111    portmapper
100024       1      udp    60588    status
100007       2      udp      817    ypbind
100021       1      udp    47016    nlockmgr
100021       3      udp    47016    nlockmgr
100021       4      udp    47016    nlockmgr
100021       1      tcp    34254    nlockmgr
100021       3      tcp    34254    nlockmgr
100021       4      tcp    34254    nlockmgr
         b. Check the output for the presence of nlockmgr. To deregister
            nlockmgr services on the node, use the -d switch in rpcinfo on
            the MapR node.
[root@ClusterNode1 ~]# rpcinfo -d 100021 1
[root@ClusterNode1 ~]# rpcinfo -d 100021 2
[root@ClusterNode1 ~]# rpcinfo -d 100021 3
[root@ClusterNode1 ~]# rpcinfo -d 100021 4
         c. Re-check rpcinfo output to verify that no nlockmgr services
            are registered. The NFS mount completes successfully at this
            point.
C:\Users\administrator.Client1>mount -o nolock -u:mapr -p:mapr ClusterNode1:/map
r/ Z:
Z: is now successfully connected to ClusterNode1:/mapr/
The command completed successfully.

Configuring Access When ACES are set

   Some NFS clients, such as the Microsoft native Windows NFSv3 client,
   check mode bits to determine if access is allowed even before
   contacting the NFS server. If ACEs are set on a directory or file, the
   client-side permission checks based solely on mode bits will prevent
   the client from accessing the file or directory. You can set the value
   for the WindowsAceSupport property to true in the [6]nfsserver.conf
   file to allow the Windows client access to the file or directory. The
   default value for this property is false, denying the client access
   even before contacting the NFS server.

   When the WindowsAceSupport property value is set to true, MapR returns
   to the client the mode bits 777 if ACE is set on the file or directory,
   thus allowing the client to establish a connection to the server.
   However, when the client actually tries to read or write from the
   server, MapR performs permission checks against the mode bits and ACEs
   on the directory and/or file, ensuring proper access.
   Note: When set to true:
     * Tools that visually display access information might show
       read/write access for user who do not have that access.
     * Files that are not executables might appear so.
     * NFSv3 client cannot be used to access NFSv4 server because the
       NFSv4 server only supports the v4 protocol.
