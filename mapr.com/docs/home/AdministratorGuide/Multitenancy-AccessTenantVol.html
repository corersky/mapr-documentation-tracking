Enabling and Restricting Access to Tenant Volume and Data

   In a [1]multi-tenant environment, the tenant volume (share) can be
   accessed by all users on the tenant instance by default. To restrict
   access to specific users and/or groups:
    1. Log in to the cluster as the cluster administrator and set ACEs on
       the volume using the volume commands.
       For example:
maprcli volume modify -name <volumename> -readAce "u:<user>|g:<group>" -writeAce
 "u:<user>|g:<group>"
       Here, value for <user> must be the UID of the user and value of
       <group> must be GID of the group on the tenant host.
       Tip: For more information, see [2]maprcli volume modify command.
    2. Log in as the tenant admin and set permissions for data access.
       You can set permissions using:
          + Linux commands such as chmod, chown, and so on.
          + Access control expressions, which can be set on files and
            directories in the volume. For more information, see
            [3]Enabling Volume, Directory, and File Authorizations with
            ACEs.
