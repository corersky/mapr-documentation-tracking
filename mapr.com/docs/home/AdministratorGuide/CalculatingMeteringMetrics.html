Calculating Metering Metrics

   The metering metrics of tiered data is based on collection of total
   gigabytes of data offloaded with object tiering to cloud storage and
   the total amount of data (without replication) sitting in the cold
   tier.
     * Total gigabytes of data offloaded with object tiering to cloud
       storage.
       This metric is computed by picking the "offloaded" value, in
       gigabytes, in the collected [1]dashboard info stats from the
       tiering section. At any time, it gives the total amount of data
       offloaded to cold tiers for that cluster in gigabytes. The
       dashboard information is collected every 15 mins by the metering
       daemon.
     * Total amount of data (without replication) sitting in the cold
       tier.
       This metric is also computed from the same series of collected
       [2]dashboard info stats from the tiering section. It is the
       difference between consecutive values of "offloaded" in the series,
       ignoring negative values, and summing the series of positive values
       over the billing period.
