Enabling YARN Log Aggregation

   To enable YARN log aggregation, add or edit the following properties in
   yarn-site.xml:
     * Set the value of the yarn.log-aggregation-enable to true.
     * Configure the yarn.log.server.url property to contain the URL of
       the YARN HistoryServer, which should look like the following:

   CAPTION:

       secure cluster     https://<historyserver-host>:19890/jobhistory/logs
       non-secure cluster http://<historyserver-host>:19888/jobhistory/logs
     * Optional: Set the value of yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir to a
       location in the MapR file system. By default, the location is
       maprfs:///tmp/logs.
     * Optional: Set the value of
       yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix to the name of the
       folder that should contain the logs for each user. By default, the
       folder name is logs.

   On a non-secure cluster, you also need to add the following property to
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x/etc/hadoop/yarn-env.sh on the Node Manager
   nodes:

   export MAPR_IMPERSONATION_ENABLED=1

   Then restart the Node Manager services. This setting enables
   impersonation for Node Manager processes so that log files can be
   created with the correct user ownership.

   Aggregated logs are owned by the user who runs the job. For example,
   when user admin runs a job, the logs are stored to
   maprfs:///tmp/logs/admin. If user analyst runs a job, the logs are
   stored to maprfs:///tmp/logs/analyst. If these two users do not share
   the same UNIX group, they will not be able to see each other's logs.
   Note: If centralized logging and YARN log aggregation are enabled, the
   logs for MapReduce version 2 applications will be managed by
   Centralized Logging while the logs for non-MapReduce applications will
   be managed by YARN log aggregation.
