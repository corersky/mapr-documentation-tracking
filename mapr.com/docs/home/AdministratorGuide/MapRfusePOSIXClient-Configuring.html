Configuring the MapR FUSE-Based POSIX Client

   Lists FUSE configuration parameters.

   The POSIX client configuration values can be set in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/fuse.conf file. After [1]installing the FUSE-based POSIX
   client, you can edit the configuration file to define the values for
   the following parameters and save the file.
   To retrieve the list of configuration parameters, run the following
   command:
/opt/mapr/bin/posix-client-* --help

   Here * refers to basic or platinum client package installed on the
   system. If necessary, set the shared LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
   variable to run the help option with the command. For example:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.79.x86_64/jre/lib/a
md64/server/:/opt/mapr/lib

   Note: The MapR FUSE-based POSIX clients support only the configuration
   parameters in the fuse.conf file. All other FUSE configuration
   parameters are not supported. For more information on the non-mapr
   configuration parameters, refer to FUSE [2]documentation.
   Parameter Default Value Description
   fuse.mount.point /mapr (Required) Specifies the mount point where MapR
   file system must be mounted. Ensure that the specified mount point is
   empty before starting the service. Once mounted, the POSIX client has
   access to all the clusters specified in
   /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file. The value should not be /mapr
   if you wish to mask MapR branding.
   Note: If NFS server is also running on this node, ensure that the FUSE
   mount point is different from the NFS server mount point.
   fuse.log.path /opt/mapr/logs Specifies the path where the log files
   must be stored.
   fuse.client.lib.path /tmp Specifies the path to where the client
   libraries must be stored.
   Note: To install and use FUSE-based POSIX client and NFSv4 on the same
   node, ensure that the path for the client library for the FUSE-based
   POSIX client and NFSv4 is not /tmp, which is the default. Specify a
   different location for the client libraries. For example, /tmp/fuselib.
   fuse.allow.other 1 Allow other users to access the mountpoint. Value
   can be:
     * 0 - to not allow other users
     * 1 - to allow other users

   Set this to 1 only if the service is started by the root user and set
   to 0 or comment out this parameter if the service is started by a
   non-root user. If set to 1, also modify the /etc/fuse.conf file to add
   user_allow_other parameter in the file.
   fuse.big.writes 1 Specifies whether to enable writes larger than 4KB.
   Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   This sets the amount of data/buffer size that can be transferred from
   the kernel to the FUSE library per request. If enabled, FUSE will allow
   writes of 128KB from the kernel. If disabled, FUSE will allow writes of
   4KB from the kernel.
   fuse.affinity 0 (disabled) Specifies whether to enable (1) or disable
   (0) NUMA affinity. If enabled, sets the NUMA affinity for the POSIX
   client.
   fuse.auto.unmount 1 (enabled) Specifies whether to automatically
   unmount the filesystem when the process is terminated. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   fuse.num.libs
     * Basic - 1
     * Platinum - 5

   Specifies the number of client libraries to run with. For:
     * Basic client, value must be 1.
     * Platinum client, default value is 5 and can be set to a value
       greater than 5.

   More than one library allows for more than 1GB/sec throughput on remote
   operations as each additional library increases the throughput by
   sharding operations across libraries (for parallelism).
   Note: Each additional library will consume more memory and CPU.
   fuse.ra.sessions
     * Basic - 1
     * Platinum - 5

   Specifies the number of parallel read ahead sessions per library. Each
   open file acts as one read ahead session. For example, for the default
   value of 5, up to 5 files can have read ahead sessions per library. If
   value is set to 0, readahead will be disabled.
   Note: A greater value will allow more number of parallel read ahead
   sessions, which is useful if more number of files need to be opened
   simultaneously. However, note that each additional read ahead session
   will consume more memory (512K per read ahead session) and threads.
   fuse.track.memory false Specifies whether to enable (true) or disable
   (false) memory tracking for FUSE.
   fuse.num.threads 64 Specifies the number of FUSE threads in userspace
   per mountpoint. A higher number allows parallel processing of multiple
   operations. Recommended value is only up to 64.
   fuse.asyncdirect.io 1 (enabled) Specifies whether to enable
   asynchronous direct IO. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   fuse.max.read 131072 Specifies the maximum size of read requests.
   fuse.max.readahead 128k Specifies the maximum bytes to readahead.
   fuse.max.write 131072 Specifies the maximum size allowed in a (single)
   write request.
   fuse.sync.read 0 Specifies whether to enable or disable synchronized
   reads. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   fuse.max.background 64 Specifies the maximum number of asynchronous
   requests that can be submitted. IOs submits beyond the maximum limit
   (specified here) will be blocked.
   fuse.congestion.threshold 10 Specifies the kernel’s congestion
   threshold.
   fuse.flush.inline 0 Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to flush all
   writes inline. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable inline flushing
     * 1 - flush all writes inline

   If disabled, for all open files, by default, the buffer is flushed
   automatically every 3 seconds or when it reaches 64KB. If enabled,
   writes are sent to server directly.
   fuse.fast.local.directio 0 Specifies whether to optimize or disable
   FUSE client for local direct IO. Value can be:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - optimize

   fuse.evenly.spread.data 0 Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to evenly
   spread writes across the nodes on the cluster. If set to 0, which is
   the default, writes are always sent to the local master node, from
   where data is replicated on all the other nodes, and if set to 1,
   writes are distributed across different nodes. Set the value to 1 in
   case of reduced performance resulting from a large number of writes on
   the local master node.
   fuse.disable.shardcache 0 Specifies whether to disable shard cache,
   which is a cache of lookups. Value can be:
     * 0 - false
     * 1 - true

   If true, more number of lookup calls will be used. The shardcache is
   used by the FUSE client to ensure that requests for data related to the
   same file are served by the same library. This is done using hash to
   improve performance. In very rare circumstances, it might make sense to
   disable this cache in conjunction with MapR support.
   fuse.fsname   Specifies the filesystem source, which is the first field
   in /etc/mtab file. The default value is the FUSE mountpoint.
   fuse.ticketfile.location /opt/mapr/conf/maprfuseticket Specifies the
   ticket to use to start the service in secure mode. Generate the
   required ticket and place it in /opt/mapr/conf/<maprfuseticket>.
   Note: To support impersonation, provide the mapr user ticket file
   location or the user’s servicewithimpersonation ticket file location.
   You can use the mapr user ticket on the server node and service with
   impersonation ticket on client node. The FUSE service must be started
   by the root user if servicewithimpersonation ticket is specified. In
   case of non-impersonated ticket, the ticket credentials becomes the
   identity for all the requests, no matter which user is accessing the
   fuse mount point.
   See also: [3]Setting up Ticket for POSIX Client.
   fuse.nonempty 0 Specifies whether FUSE can be mounted at a non-empty
   mountpoint (1) or at an empty mountpoint (0). Value can be:
     * 0 - indicates that mount point should be empty
     * 1 - indicates that mount point need not be empty

   fuse.xattr.enable 0 (false) Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to
   enable extended attributes through the FUSE client. Value can be:
     * 0 - false
     * 1 - true

   The default value is 0 (false). This is disabled by default because if
   enabled, during operations, the kernel might make a lot of extended
   attribute calls for security checks resulting in performance
   degradation even when there are no extended attributes on the inode.
   When disabled, extended attributes can still be added using the hadoop
   fs command; however, this must be enabled to perform any operations on
   extended attributes using the FUSE-based POSIX client.
   Note: Of the five types of extended attribute namespaces in Linux,
   system, trusted, user, raw, and security, only user namespace is
   supported. For all other namespaces, EINVAL is returned.
   fuse.attr.timeout 3.0 The timeout value in seconds for file/directory
   (regular) attributes (such as file size, UID, GID, etc., which are
   normally stored inside the inode) cache. This is used to determine
   whether to use the cached attribute information (only if within the
   specified timeout window) or fetch attribute information again. The
   default is 3.0 second, which specifies that cached attribute
   information must be considered stale and refreshed after 3.0 second.
   For this option, it is possible to give fractions of a second as well
   (for example, fuse.attr.timeout=2.8).

   Set the value for this parameter to 0 to compare POSIX (pjd) compliance
   with ext3/4 filesystem. This disables caching and for better
   performance, this must be avoided.
   fuse.entry.timeout 3.0 The timeout value in seconds for the name lookup
   cache. This is used to determine whether to use the cached entry for
   the name lookup (if within the specified timeout window) or lookup name
   again. The default is 3.0 second, which specifies that cached name
   lookup information must be considered stale and refreshed after 3.0
   second. For this option, it is possible to give fractions of a second
   as well (for example, fuse.entry.timeout=2.8).

   Set the value for this parameter to 0 to compare POSIX (pjd) compliance
   with ext3/4 filesystem. This disables caching and for better
   performance, this must be avoided.
   fuse.hb.interval 5 Specifies the heartbeat interval (in seconds) for
   the FUSE-based POSIX client.
   fuse.export   Denotes the fully-qualified cluster path to the volume or
   directory under the mount point.

   When this property is not specified, all clusters found in
   mapr-clusters.conf are mounted under the entity specified by the
   fuse.mount.point property (/mapr by default). If mapr-clusters.conf
   contains two clusters A and B, there will be directories pointing to
   the root directories of those clusters, for example /mapr/A and
   /mapr/B.

   When this property is specified, it overrides the default behavior, and
   causes exactly one path from one cluster to be exposed at the entity
   specified by the fuse.mount.point property. You can either fully expose
   a single cluster, or expose only a subset of a single cluster.

   If fuse.export is set to the name of a cluster, enclosed within /, then
   that cluster is mounted at /mapr. For example if fuse.export=/A/ , then
   the path /mapr shows the root directory of cluster A.

   If fuse.export is set to a path within a cluster, then /mapr points to
   that path. For example, if fuse.export=/A/var/, then /mapr displays the
   directory contents of /var from the MapR cluster A.
   Note: If the value is not a valid path to the name of a volume or
   directory, the FUSE service will not start. The value cannot be the
   path to a file.
   fuse.enforce.core.pattern false Specifies whether (true) or not (false)
   to write to /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern file when the FUSE-based
   POSIX starts. The default value is false. If true, the core_pattern
   file contains an /opt/cores/%e.core.%p.%h entry and if false, the file
   is not touched.
   fuse.access.type rw Sets the type of access on the mount point. Value
   can be:
     * ro — Read only
     * rw — Read and write

   The default value is rw.
   fuse.auto.inval.data 1 Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to
   automatically invalidate the kernel FUSE cache for any data change,
   which causes mtime change, on the files. If set to 1, when the file is
   read, correct file data is returned. If set to 0, kernel cache of the
   data, which might not have the most current change, might be returned.
   fuse.disable.writeback
     * 1 (v6.0.1)
     * 0 (v6.0)

   Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to disable writeback cache. This
   parameter is applicable only in kernel versions >= 3.15. By default, in
   kernel versions >= 3.15, writeback is enabled in MapR v6.0 and disabled
   in MapR v6.0.1. To enable writeback cache, set the value for this
   parameter to 0. If enabled, the writes are buffered in the kernel.
   However, when multiple FUSE clients work on the same file, writes to
   file by one FUSE client might never be seen by other FUSE clients
   performing a read because the kernel does not update the attributes of
   the file unless the file is modified locally. You can disable writeback
   cache to allow the kernel to perform a write through.
   fuse.cluster.conf.location /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf The path
   to the configuration file to use.
   fuse.log.debug_level error The FUSE-based posix client log level. Value
   can be one of the following:
     * fatal
     * error
     * warn
     * info
     * debug

   The default value is error.
   fuse.use.compressed.inode.format 0 Specifies whether or not to use
   compressed inode format. When enabled, a 16 bit uniquifier is used to
   avoid inode cache collisions when multiple clients are modifying
   (creating, deleting, etc.) the same directories/files.. Value can be
   one of the following:
     * 0 — (default) do not use compressed inode format
     * 1 — use compressed inode format including uniquifier

   Note: Even when set to 1, EBUSY errors are returned if client accesses
   more than 32k volumes at the same time.
   fuse.negative.timeout 3.0 Applicable for POSIX clients (both Basic and
   Platinum) from version 6.0.1.20180404222005.GA‌-20190208030353 and
   above.

   Indicates the duration in seconds to cache negative lookup results.

   Set this value to 0 to disable the cache.
   When patching or upgrading the client from an older release, this
   parameter is automatically applied. However, new parameters are not
   automatically written to fuse.conf. Make sure to copy this parameter
   from fuse.conf.new to fuse.conf, only if you want to change the default
   value and disable this cache.

   You must start/restart the FUSE-based POSIX client for the changes to
   take effect. See [4]Starting and Stopping the POSIX Client for more
   information.
   Note:

   When you install a patch, the /opt/mapr/conf/fuse.conf.new file
   contains the new settings. You can copy the new parameters (with
   default values) to your existing fuse.conf file and restart FUSE for
   the settings to take effect.

   When you upgrade from a prior release, on all supported OS other than
   Ubuntu, the old fuse.conf file is backed up as fuse.conf.backup, before
   being overwritten with the new settings. This backup is available in
   the /opt/mapr/conf directory.

   On Ubuntu, the upgrade process does not create a backup copy of the
   file. You need to manually backup the fuse.conf file before upgrading,
   as this file is overwritten with the new settings after upgrading.

   To continue using FUSE with your custom settings, and take advantage of
   the new settings, manually copy your custom settings in the
   fuse.conf.backup file to the fuse.conf file, set custom values for the
   new parameters in the fuse.conf file where necessary, and restart FUSE
   for the settings to take effect.

   To restart FUSE, use one of the following commands depending on the
   posix client you use:
     * For posix basic: service mapr-posix-client-basic restart
     * For posix platinum: service mapr-posix-client-platinum restart

Optimizing FUSE performance when running the Flexible I/O tester (fio tool)

   Performance Tips
     * With Linux kernels prior to version 4.8, size extending writes are
       serialized by the kernel, and result in degraded write performance.
       For optimized write performance, ensure that the Linux kernel in
       use, is at least version 4.8.
     * With kernel 4.8 and above, fio performance improves when using
       larger block sizes and larger number of jobs (numjobs). Keep
       numjobs constant and use larger blocksizes (>128k) for enhanced
       performance.

   For example, for optimised performance, the fio command could be as
   follows:
fio --ioengine=libaio --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=perftest --filename=perf
ile
          --bs=16m --iodepth=64 --size=4G --rw=write --numjobs=4
