Configure the OpenTSDB Service Heap Size

   By default, OpenTSDB service is configured to use a default heap size
   of 2 gigabytes (recommended size is 6 gigabytes). You can edit the
   warden.opentsdb.conf file on each node to override the default value.
    1. Configure the following properties in the
       opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.opentsdb.conf file on each node:

        service.heapsize.min
                The minimum heap size in megabytes. For example,
                service.heapsize.min=256.

        service.heapsize.max
                The maximum heap size in megabytes. For example,
                service.heapsize.max=6000. This value must match the value
                of JVMXMX.

    2. Restart the OpenTSDB service.
maprcli node services -name opentsdb -nodes <space separated list of OpenTSDB no
des> -action restart

   Note: These values only control the OpenTSDB service heap size, not the
   entire amount of memory used by the OpenTSDB service.
