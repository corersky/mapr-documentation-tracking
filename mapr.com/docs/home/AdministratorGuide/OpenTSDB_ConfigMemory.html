Configure the OpenTSDB Service Heap Size

   By default, the OpenTSDB service is configured to use a default heap
   size of 6 gigabytes. The default heap size can be adjusted by modifying
   certain configuration files.

   In MEPs 6.0.1 and later, the OpenTSDB service is configured to use a
   default heap size of 6 GB. In earlier MEPs, the default was configured
   to be 2 GB. If you configure a custom value for the OpenTSDB service
   heap size and then upgrade to MEPs 6.0.1 or later, you will see the
   6-GB default implemented in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.opentsdb.conf file.

   To change the heap size to a different setting, edit the configuration
   files on all OpenTSDB nodes as follows. The following steps change the
   heap size from 2 GB to 6 GB:
    1. Edit the /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.opentsdb.conf file to change:
service.heapsize.max=2000
service.heapsize.min=2000
       to
service.heapsize.max=6000
service.heapsize.min=6000
    2. Edit the /opt/mapr/opentsdb/opentsdb-*/etc/init.d/opentsdb file to
       change:
$
{JVMXMX:=-Xmx2000m -Xss1m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m}
       to
$
{JVMXMX:=-Xmx6000m -Xss1m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m}
    3. Restart the OpenTSDB service:
maprcli node services -name opentsdb -nodes <space-separated list of OpenTSDB no
des> -action restart
