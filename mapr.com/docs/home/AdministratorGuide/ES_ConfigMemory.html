Configure the Elasticsearch Service Heap Size

   The Elasticsearch service is memory-intensive. By default, the
   Elasticsearch service is configured to use a minimum and maximum heap
   size of 2 GB. You can override these default values in the jvm.options
   file. Restart Elasticsearch after you modify the settings.

   The jvm.options file centralizes arguments to the Java Virtual Machine
   to simplify the management of the JVM options. You can no longer set
   the JVM options through the ES_MIN_MEM, ES_MAX_MEM, ES_HEAP_SIZE,
   ES_HEAP_NEWSIZE, ES_DIRECT_SIZE, ES_USE_IPV4,ES_GC_OPTS,
   ES_GC_LOG_FILE, and JAVA_OPTS environment variables.
   If you installed the Elasticsearch service from the TAR or ZIP
   distributions, you can locate the jvm.options file in
   config/jvm.options. If you installed ElasticSearch from the Debian or
   RPM packages, you can locate the jvm.options file in
   $ES_HOME/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options directory, for example:
/opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elasticsearch

   To specify an alternative location, set the ES_JVM_OPTIONS environment
   variable to the file path.

Configuring Memory in the jvm.options File

   The -Xms and -Xmx values in the jvm.options file set the Elasticsearch
   heap size, as shown:
-Xms2g
-Xmx2g

   The -Xms parameter sets the minimum heap size in gigabytes. The -Xmx
   parameter sets the maximum heap size in gigabytes. Elasticsearch
   recommends that both parameters have the same value.
   If you have enabled memory settings in the ElasticSearch Warden
   configuration file, located in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.elasticsearch.conf directory, the -Xms and
   -Xmx values must match the service.heapsize.min and
   service.heapsize.max values set in warden.elasticsearch.conf, as shown:
service.heapsize.min=2000
service.heapsize.max=2000

   Note: The service.heapsize.min and service.heapsize.max values are set
   in megabytes as an integer.

Restarting the Elasticsearch Service

   After you modify the settings in the jvm.options file, issue the
   following command to restart the Elasticsearch service:
maprcli node services -name elasticsearch -nodes <space separated list of Elasti
csearch nodes> -action restart

   Tip:
     * On a production cluster, you can lock Elasticsearch memory to
       improve performance. To lock Elasticsearchmemory, set the
       “bootstrap.mlockall: true” option in
       $ES_HOME/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml.
     * If Elasticsearch uses more than 75% of the configured heap size,
       you may want to increase the maximum heapsize value.
       For more information, see the [1]Elasticsearch documentation.
