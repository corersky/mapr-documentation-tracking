Examining the Cause of Failure

   In the faileddisk.log file, you will see information on the cause of
   failure. In the sample log output below, the failure reason is I/O
   error. Notice that the log file also provides instructions for removing
   disks and adding them back to MapR Filesystem.
############################ Disk Failure Report ###########################
Disk                :    /dev/sdd
Vendor              :    [vendor]
Model Number        :    [model]
Serial Number       :    [serial]
Firmware Revision   :    [firmware]
Size                :    [total]
Failure Reason      :    I/O error
Time of Failure     :    Fri Jan 31 12:48:00 GMT 2014
Resolution          :   Please refer to MapR's online documentation at [1]http:/
/www.mapr.com/doc on how to handle
        disk failures.
In summary, run the following steps:
a. If this appears to be a software failure, go to step
b. Otherwise, physically remove the disk /dev/sdd. Optionally, replace it with a
 new disk.
b. Run the command "maprcli disk remove -host 127.0.0.1 -disks /dev/sdd" to remo
ve
        /dev/sdd from MapR-FS.
c. In addition to /dev/sdd, the above command removes all the disks that belong
to the same
        storage pool, from MapR-FS.      Note down the names of all removed disk
s.
d. Add all the above removed disks (exclude /dev/sdd) and the new disk to MapR-F
S by
   running the command:
   "maprcli disk add -host 127.0.0.1 -disks <comma separated list of
      disks>"
   For example, If /dev/sdx is the new replaced disk, and /dev/sdy, /dev/sdz wer
e removed in
        step c), the command would be:
   "maprcli disk add -host 127.0.0.1 -disks /dev/sdx,/dev/sdy,/dev/sdz"      If
there is no new disk, the command would just be:                   "maprcli disk
 add -host 127.0.0.1 -disks
    /dev/sdy,/dev/sdz"
