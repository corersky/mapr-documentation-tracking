Setting Up a Tenant

   To set up a tenant:
    1. On the server:
         a. Log in to the cluster as the administrator and create a user
            (for the tenant admin) on the cluster.
            The user (for the tenant) must exist on all the cluster nodes
            with the same UID and GID or all the cluster nodes must
            connect to the same LDAP server. See [1]Managing Users and
            Groups for more information.
            Note: The superuser for a tenant, referred to as tenant admin,
            must have a UID of 0 on the tenant host(s) to access the
            tenant volume (only) and all data in the tenant volume.
            Although the tenant admin has the same UID as the MapR
            superuser, the tenant admin does not have the same level of
            access and administration privileges as the MapR superuser
            because the tenant adminâ€™s access is based on the tenant
            ticket and is restricted to the tenant volume.
         b. Generate a tenant ticket for the user.
            For more information, see [2]Generating a Ticket for a Tenant.
         c. Copy the ticket to the tenant host and grant the tenant
            administrator read access to the ticket.
         d. Create a volume (or share) on the cluster for the tenant.
            For more information, see [3]Creating a Volume for a Tenant.
    2. On the tenant instance:
         a. Log in as tenant administrator (root).
         b. Mount the file system using loopbacknfs or the FUSE-based
            POSIX client.
            For more information, see [4]Mounting a Tenant Volume.
            Note: While starting the POSIX client, use the tenant ticket
            configured in step 1.
         c. As tenant admin, grant access to users by setting permissions
            to data using either [5]file ACEs or mode bits.
            For more information, see [6]Enabling and Restricting Access
            to Tenant Volume and Data.
