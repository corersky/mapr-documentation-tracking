Hadoop 2.x Capacity Scheduler

   The CapacityScheduler is a pluggable scheduler for Hadoop that allows
   multiple tenants to securely share a large cluster. Resources are
   allocated to each tenant's applications in a way that fully utilizes
   the cluster, governed by the constraints of allocated capacities.

   Queues are typically set up by administrators to reflect the economics
   of the shared cluster. The Capacity Scheduler supports hierarchical
   queues to ensure that resources are shared among the sub-queues of an
   organization before other queues are allowed to use free resources.
