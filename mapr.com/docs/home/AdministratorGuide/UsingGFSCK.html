Using Global File System Checking

   You can use the [1]gfsck (global file system check) command to perform
   a consistency check and repair operation on a volume or volume
   snapshot, including the following entities:
     * All cross-container links (for example, from file to filelets, or
       from table to tablets)
     * The tabletmap key range
     * The attributes of filelets (uid/gid/mode)

   This command identifies the unreachable files, directories, and tables
   in the volume, and moves them to /lost+found to be repaired. It also
   identifies and fixes any unreachable DB inodes or dangling pointers to
   lost inodes.
    1. Take the affected storage pools offline by running the [2]mrconfig
       sp offline command.
       For example:
/opt/mapr/server/mrconfig sp offline /dev/sdc
    2. Execute the [3]fsck command on the storage pools or disks.
    3. Bring the storage pools back online by running the [4]mrconfig sp
       online command.
       For example:
mrconfig sp online /dev/sdc
    4. Run the gfsck command on the affected volumes, or snapshots.
       If there are alarms, such as DataUnavailableAlarm or
       DataUnderReplicatedAlarm, do not run the gfsck command with the -r
       (--repair) option. Running the gfsck command with the -r (--repair)
       option, might result in data loss. If necessary, first run gfsck
       without the -r (--repair) option, and attempt to repair only after
       analyzing the command output.
