Promotable Mirrors

   In general, mirror volumes are created for the purpose of preventing or
   minimizing data loss. Data loss scenarios range from accidental
   overwrites to rack failure, to a disaster that destroys an entire
   datacenter. Mirror volumes are also used to improve performance or to
   make copies of data for use in other clusters without impacting
   production.
   As of the 4.0.2 release, all new mirror volumes can be made into
   read-write volumes. In addition, read-write volumes that were mirrored
   to other volumes can be made into mirrors (to establish a mirroring
   relationship in the other direction). This functionality is useful in
   scenarios such as:
     * Disaster recovery If a read-write volume with critical data goes
       down in a primary datacenter, a mirror volume in a remote
       datacenter can be made into a read-write volume in order to
       maintain business continuity. Later, if the primary datacenter
       comes back online, the original mirror relationship can be restored
       by making the new read-write volume back into a mirror volume.
     * Running applications on a copy of production data
     * Resynchronization (reestablishing a mirror relationship after it is
       broken)
