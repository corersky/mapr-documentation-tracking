Migrating Files From MapR Edge Cluster to AWS S3

   The File Migration service for [1]MapR Edge clusters monitors a set of
   configured directory trees (referred to as policies in the service UI)
   on the MapR cluster for new and changed files. When the service detects
   new or changed files, it automatically uploads them to AWS S3, which is
   Amazonâ€™s storage environment, using the AWS SDK TransferManager object.
   The File Migration service is a long-running process that is controlled
   by Warden.
   Note: For information on installing File Migration Service on your Edge
   cluster, see [2]Installing the File Migration Service on the Edge
   Cluster.
