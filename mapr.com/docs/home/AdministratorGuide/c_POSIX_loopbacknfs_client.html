MapR loopbacknfs POSIX Client

   The MapR POSIX Client feature allows app servers, web servers, and
   other client nodes and apps to read and write directly to a MapR
   cluster. Starting with the 4.0.2 release, MapR provides single-user
   loopbacknfs licenses that give access to one or more clusters.
   The table below summarizes the differences between the basic Linux OS
   NFS client and the MapR POSIX client:

   CAPTION:

   Linux OS Client MapR POSIX Client
   Client OS
     * Supported Linux distributions and desktop systems (Mac OS X and
       Windows)

     * Supported Linux distributions only
     * No version for Mac OS X

   Installs On Node Type
     * Client node - not part of MapR cluster
     * No mapr-fileserver or other Hadoop services

     * Client node
     * Cluster node

   Access to Cluster
     * Must have direct network access to all MapR cluster nodes

     * Same

   Supported Interfaces
     * Apache HDFS and MapR Filesystem

     * POSIX-NFS

   Connection to File System
     * Point to point
     * Via an NFS gateway
     * Single point of failure

     * Proxied on host to regular MapR client traffic
     * Direct, no NFS gateway
     * No single point of failure

   Security
     * Link to NFS gateway is insecure

     * Fully secured

   The Linux OS NFS client must go through an NFS gateway, the link to the
   gateway is not secured, and transmitted data is not compressed.

   The following diagram illustrates how the MapR POSIX client
   (mapr-loopbacknfs) works, in comparison with the Linux OS NFS client
   (left).

   The instructions on this page are for the MapR POSIX client. For
   instructions on setting up NFS on a MapR cluster, see [1]Managing MapR
   NFS.
   The table below summarizes the differences in the MapR POSIX client
   deployment behavior when installed with a MapR cluster where security
   is disabled or enabled:

   CAPTION:

   Cluster Security Disabled Cluster Security Enabled
   Client Node
     * MapR cluster looks exactly like network attached storage (NAS)
     * POSIX permissions are enforced

     * Single-user authentication
     * Write access is supported only for applications with uid matching
       authenticated user

   Cluster Node
     * MapR cluster looks exactly like NAS
     * POSIX permissions are enforced

     * Secure cluster access is key
     * Best Practice: Use ticket from mapr user
