Specifying Fair Scheduler Configuration Properties in yarn-site.xml

   The [1]yarn-site.xml file contains parameters that determine
   scheduler-wide options. These properties include:
   Parameter Default Value Description
   yarn.scheduler.fair.allocation.file fair-scheduler.xml Specifies the
   path to the allocation file. If a relative path is given, the file is
   searched for on the classpath.
   yarn.scheduler.fair.user-as-default-queue true Indicates whether to use
   the username associated with the allocation file as the default queue
   name, if a queue name is not specified.
   Note: If a queue placement policy is given in the allocations file,
   this property is ignored.
   yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption false Indicates whether to use
   preemption.
   Note: Do not use preemption when FairScheduler DominantResourceFairness
   is in use and node labels are present.
   yarn.scheduler.fair.sizebasedweight false Indicates whether to assign
   shares to individual applications based on their size, rather than
   providing an equal share to all applications regardless of size. When
   set to true, applications are weighted by (ln 1 + <application's total
   requested memory>)/ ln 2.
   yarn.scheduler.fair.assignmultiple false Indicates whether to allow
   multiple container assignments in one heartbeat.
