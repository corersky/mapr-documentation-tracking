Viewing the Contents of a Snapshot from the Command Line

   At the top level of each volume is a directory called .snapshot
   containing all the snapshots for the volume. You can view the directory
   with hadoop fs commands or by mounting the cluster with NFS. To prevent
   recursion problems, ls and hadoop fs -ls do not show the .snapshot
   directory when the top-level volume directory contents are listed. You
   must navigate explicitly to the .snapshot directory to view and list
   the snapshots for the volume.

   Example:
root@node41:/opt/mapr/bin# hadoop fs -ls /myvol/.snapshot
Found 1 items
drwxrwxrwx   - root root          1 2011-06-01 09:57 /myvol/.snapshot/2011-06-01
.09-57-49
