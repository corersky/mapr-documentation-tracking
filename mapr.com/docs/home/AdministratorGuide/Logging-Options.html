Logging Options

   In a MapR cluster, the logging option that you configure defines how
   the logs are stored and accessed.
     * Centralized logging. The logs are written to local volumes on the
       MapR file system.
     * YARN log aggregation. The logs are written to the local file system
       and then the container logs from each node are aggregated and
       stored on the MapR file system.
     * Local logging. The log files for each job or application are
       written to the local file system. This is the default behavior for
       MapReduce version 2 (MRv2) applications and non-MapReduce
       applications.
          + For MRv2 or other applications that run on YARN, the logs are
            written to the following directory on the local filesystem:
            /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/logs/userlogs/

   The logging options that you can choose from are determined by the type
   of jobs or applications that you run:
       Type of Job or Application    Available Logging Options
   MRv2
     * Centralized logging
     * YARN log aggregation
     * Local logging (default)

   YARN applications (non- MapReduce)
     * YARN log aggregation
     * Local logging (default)

   If you enable centralized logging for MRv2, the MapReduce applications
   will use centralized logging, while the other YARN applications in the
   cluster will use local logging.
   Note: Select a logging option that stores the logs on the MapR file
   system for the following reasons:
     * Prevent job or application failures due to a lack of space on the
       local file system for logs.
     * Prevent the loss or inaccessibility of logs due to node failure.
       Logs stored in a local volume are two-way replicated.
