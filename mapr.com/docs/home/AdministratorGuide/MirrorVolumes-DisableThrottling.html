Disabling Mirror Throttling Using the CLI

   By default, mirror throttling is enabled, which means that the server
   that sends mirror data restricts itself to 30% (by default) of the
   available bandwidth. Mirror throttling is based on the number of
   outstanding requests on the network and outstanding I/O requests on
   disk and can be tuned using the parameters, mfs.disk.iothrottle.count,
   mfs.disk.resynciothrottle.factor, and
   mfs.network.resynciothrottle.factor, in the [1]mfs.conf file. When
   other processes need more network bandwidth, the server throttles back
   to slow down the rate of data transfer.

   By disabling throttling, the mirror operation completes faster. To
   disable mirror throttling from the command line, run the volume modify
   command on the source volume and set the -mirrorthrottle option to
   false, as shown in this example:
Cluster1> maprcli volume modify -name volA -mirrorthrottle false

   This command disables throttling for all mirror volumes whose source is
   volA. Note that the -mirrorthrottle option only applies to volumes that
   have mirrors.
