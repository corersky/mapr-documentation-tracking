MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Metrics

   Every 10 seconds, the collectd service uses a MapR plugin to gather the
   following Streams metrics on each node in the cluster.
   Warning: MapR monitoring uses 2 MB disk space per minute per node when
   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka metrics is enabled. This is
   approximately 3 GB per day on a single node or 7 GB per node per day
   with a 3X replication. This stream metrics data is automatically
   deleted every 3 days.
   Name Description
   mapr.streams.produce_rpcs The number of Streams producer RPCs. This
   metric is available as of MEP 2.0.
   mapr.streams.produce_msgs The number of Streams messages produced. This
   metric is available as of MEP 2.0.
   mapr.streams.produce_bytes

   The number of megabytes produced by Streams messages.

   This metric is available as of MEP 2.0.
   mapr.streams.listen_rpcs The number of Streams consumer RPCs. This
   metric is available as of MEP 2.0.
   mapr.streams.listen_msgs The number of Streams messages read by the
   consumer. This metric is available as of MEP 4.0.
   Note: If you upgrade to MEP 4.0, all Streams messages are consumed,
   however this metric only reports a count on messages that were produced
   in MEP 4.0. Messages produced prior to MEP 4.0 are consumed, but not
   counted. In this scenario, the metric reports a partial count or a zero
   count if all messages were produced prior to MEP 4.0.
   mapr.streams.listen_currpcs The number of concurrent Stream consumer
   RPCs. This metric is available as of MEP 2.0.
   mapr.streams.listen_bytes The number of megabytes consumed by Streams
   messages. This metric is available as of MEP 2.0.
