Configure Purge Duration

   Based on your requirements, you can configure a purge duration for
   Elasticsearch.
   To update the purge duration on node with installed Elasticsearch
   6.5.3, run the following command:
/opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<Version>/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/es_c
luster_mgmt.sh --purgeAge <newValue>

   This command will automatically update the elete_indices.yml file. This
   change updates only the unit_count value to newValue, without changing
   the unit value.
