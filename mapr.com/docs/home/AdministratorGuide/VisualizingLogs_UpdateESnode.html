Update the Elasticsearch URL for Kibana

   Kibana connects to a single Elasticsearch node to read logs. In the
   event that Kibana is unable to read logs due to the failure of an
   Elasticsearch node, configure Kibana to connect to an available
   Elasticsearch node.
   Note: The Elasticsearch node that Kibana connects to by default is
   determined by the first Elasticsearch node that was specified when the
   cluster was configured to use MapR Monitoring
    1. Open /opt/mapr/kibana/kibana-<version>/config/kibana.yml.
    2. Update the elasticsearch.url parameter to point to an available
       Elasticsearch node.
       Tip: If you want to configure Kibana to work even if the
       Elasticsearch node is unavailable, see the [1]Kibana documentation
       for the steps to configure Kibana to load balance across multiple
       Elasticsearch nodes.
