Adding a CLDB Role Using the CLI

   Complete the following steps to add the CLDB role to a node in the
   cluster:
    1. Install the CLDB package.
    2. Run configure.sh -C on the node where you added the new CLDB role.
       Using the -C option provides the list of CLDB nodes. If Warden is
       running, the CLDB service starts automatically.
    3. Run configure.sh on all other nodes in the cluster.
       Use the -C option and provide the list of CLDB nodes that includes
       the new node.
    4. Start or restart Warden on the node where you added the CLDB role.
    5. Perform a rolling restart of Warden on all other nodes. Warden
       picks up the new CLDB node. Issue the following command to restart
       Warden on the node where you installed the role:
% service mapr-warden restart
