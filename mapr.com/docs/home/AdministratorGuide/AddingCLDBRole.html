Adding a CLDB Role Using the CLI

   Complete the following steps to add the CLDB role to a node in the
   cluster:

Adding a CLDB Role to a Node on an Unsecure Cluster

    1. Install the CLDB package, mapr-cldb, on the node with the apt-get,
       yum, or zypper commands, depending on your operating system.
    2. Run [1]configure.sh with the -C and -R options on the node where
       you added the new CLDB role.
       Use the -C option to provide the list of CLDB nodes. If Warden is
       running, the CLDB service starts automatically.
    3. Run [2]configure.sh with the -R options on all other nodes in the
       cluster.
       Use the -C option and provide the list of CLDB nodes, including the
       new node.
    4. Verify that the node has a CLDB role by running the following
       command:
maprcli node listcldbs
       The output should show all the CLDB nodes including the node where
       the role was added.

Adding a CLDB Role to a Node on a Secure Cluster

    1. Install the CLDB package, mapr-cldb, on the node with the apt-get,
       yum, or zypper commands, depending on your operating system.
    2. Copy the following files from the /opt/mapr/conf directory on any
       existing CLDB node on the cluster to the /opt/mapr/conf directory
       on this node.
          + cldb.key
          + dare.master.key
          + maprserverticket
          + ssl_keystore
          + ssl_keystore.p12
          + ssl_keystore.pem
          + ssl_truststore
          + ssl_truststore.p12
          + ssl_truststore.pem
       Note: This dare.master.key will be present only if the cluster is
       enabled for encryption of data at rest.
    3. Run [3]configure.sh with the following options on the node where
       you added the new CLDB role.
          + -secure: Use this option to enable the node for security.
          + -C: Use this option to include this node in the list of CLDB
            nodes. If Warden is running, the CLDB service starts
            automatically.
          + -dare: Use this option only if the cluster is enabled for data
            at rest encryption. Do not specify this if the cluster is not
            enabled for data at rest encryption.
          + Use one of the following to configure the list of ZooKeeper
            nodes:
               o -R: Use this option if the node is an existing cluster
                 node. This option uses the previously configured list of
                 ZooKeeper nodes. When -R is specified, the ZooKeeper
                 credentials are read from warden.conf file.
               o -Z: Use this option if the node is a new node on the
                 cluster. This option specifies the list of ZooKeeper
                 nodes.
    4. Run [4]configure.sh with the following options on all other nodes
       in the cluster.
          + -C: Use this option to include the new CLDB node in the list
            of CLDB nodes.
          + -R: Use this option to use the previously configured list of
            ZooKeeper nodes.
    5. Verify that the node has a CLDB role by running the following
       command:
maprcli node listcldbs
       The output should show all the CLDB nodes including the node where
       the role was added.
