Logging on to Grafana

   This page describes the credentials needed to log on to Grafana for
   secure and nonsecure clusters for MapR 6.0 and later.

   MEP 5.0.0 and MapR Installer 1.9.0 implemented some changes in security
   that affect the user IDs and passwords you need to log on to Grafana.
   Beginning with MEP 5.0.0, Grafana uses the Pluggable Authentication
   Module (PAM) and HTTPS to authenticate on secure MapR clusters.

MEP 4.x.x (Grafana 4.4.2) and Earlier

   To log on, enter the default Grafana admin user and password:
     * User: admin
     * Password: admin

MEP 5.x.x (Grafana 4.6.1) and Later

   To log on, specify the user and password as follows:
   Secure Cluster Nonsecure Cluster
   User Type the MapR cluster admin user ID. Type the Grafana admin user
   ID.
   Password Type the MapR cluster admin password that you specified during
   cluster installation. Type the password for the Grafana admin user that
   you specified during cluster installation. (During cluster
   installation, the MapR Installer web interface asks you to provide this
   password. You can also provide the password by using configure.sh
   during a manual installation.)

For More Information

   To change the Grafana password, see [1]Changing the Password for
   Grafana.

   For more information about the Grafana versions supported by each MEP,
   see [2]MEP Components and OS Support.

   For information about the MEPs supported by different MapR Core
   versions, see [3]MEP Support by MapR Core Version.
