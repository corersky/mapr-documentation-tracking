Centralized Logging

   MapR's Centralized Logging feature provides a job-centric or
   application-centric view of all log files generated by a MapReduce
   program. With centralized logging, the log files are written to local
   volumes in the MapR file system. You can run the maprcli job linklogs
   command for running or completed jobs to create a centralized log
   directory populated with symbolic links to all log files pertaining to
   the specified jobs or to the application.
