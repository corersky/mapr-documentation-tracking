Mounting NFS to MapR Filesystem on a Cluster Node

   You can automatically or manually mount a NFS to the MapR Filesystem on
   a cluster node.

   Automatically Mount
   Use this procedure to automatically mount NFS to MapR Filesystem on the
   cluster my.cluster.com at the /mapr mount point.
    1. Set up the mount point by creating the directory.
sudo mkdir /mapr
    2. Add the following line to /opt/mapr/conf/mapr_fstab:
<hostname>:/mapr /mapr hard,nolock
       Note: The change to /opt/mapr/conf/mapr_fstab will not take effect
       until Warden is restarted.
       Every time your system is rebooted, the mount point is
       automatically reestablished according to the mapr_fstab
       configuration file.

   Manually Mount
   Use this procedure to manually mount NFS to MapR Filesystem on the
   cluster my.cluster.com at the /mapr mount point.
    1. Set up a mount point for an NFS share.
sudo mkdir /mapr
    2. Mount the cluster via NFS.
sudo mount -o hard,nolock usa-node01:/mapr /mapr
       Note: When you mount manually from the command line, the mount
       point does not persist after a reboot.
