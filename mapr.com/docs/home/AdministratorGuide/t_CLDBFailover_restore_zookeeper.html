1. Restore ZooKeeper

   If the CLDB node that failed was also running ZooKeeper, install
   ZooKeeper on another node to maintain the minimum required number of
   ZooKeeper nodes. Before installing ZooKeeper on another node, ensure
   that the ZooKeeper role is deleted on the failed node. See [1]Removing
   ZooKeeper Role for more information.
