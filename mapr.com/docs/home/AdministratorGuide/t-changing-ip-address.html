Changing the IP Address of a Node

   You can change the IP address of any node in the cluster.

Changing the IP Address of a Data Node

   Complete the following steps to change an IP address of a data node:
    1. Shut down Warden and ZooKeeper on the node to be changed.
% service mapr-zookeeper stop
% service mapr-warden stop
    2. Change the IP address of the node.
    3. Edit the /etc/hosts file on all nodes to reflect the IP address
       change, or ensure that the IP addresses are resolvable through a
       DNS search.
    4. On the node where you changed the IP address, restart the network
       interface. The interface shuts down, so you lose the connection.
    5. Log into the node using the new IP address.
    6. Check the IP address.
       For example, run ifconfig.
    7. If MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable is set, edit the value for the
       MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable in the /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh file
       and make sure that the new IP address is part of it.
       See [1]Setting the MAPR_SUBNETS Environment Variable for more
       information.
    8. Restart Warden on the node(s) where the IP address has changed.
    9. Check that all nodes appear in the output of the node list command.
% maprcli node list -columns ip
       You might have to wait a few minutes until all nodes are registered
       before you get output from this command.

Changing the IP Address of CLDB Node

   Complete the following steps to change an IP address of a CLDB node:
    1. Shut down Warden and ZooKeeper on the node to be changed.
% service mapr-zookeeper stop
% service mapr-warden stop
    2. Change the IP address of the node.
    3. Edit the /etc/hosts file on all nodes to reflect the IP address
       change, or ensure that the IP addresses are resolvable through a
       DNS search.
    4. On the node where you changed the IP address, restart the network
       interface. The interface shuts down, so you lose the connection.
    5. Log into the node using the new IP address.
    6. Check the IP address. For example, run ifconfig.
    7. Run configure.sh on the node where you changed the IP address.
       Use the -C option to provide a list of CLDB nodes.
    8. Perform a rolling restart of Warden on all the nodes.
    9. Check that all nodes appear in the output of the node list command.
       You might have to wait a few minutes until all nodes are registered
       before you get output from this command.
% maprcli node list -columns ip

Changing the IP Address of ZooKeeper Node

   Complete the following steps to change an IP address of a ZooKeeper
   node:
    1. Shut down Warden and ZooKeeper on the node to be changed.
% service mapr-zookeeper stop
% service mapr-warden stop
    2. Change the IP address of the node.
    3. Edit the /etc/hosts file on all nodes to reflect the IP address
       change, or ensure that the IP addresses are resolvable through a
       DNS search.
    4. On the node where you changed the IP address, restart the network
       interface. The interface shuts down, so you lose the connection.
    5. Log into the node using the new IP address.
    6. Check the IP address.
       For example, run ifconfig.
    7. Run configure.sh on the node where you changed the IP address.
       Use the -Z option to provide the list of ZooKeeper nodes.
    8. If you run the Drillbit service on any nodes in the cluster:
         a. Change the ZooKeeper address in the conf/drill-override.conf
            file on the Drill nodes.
         b. Start ZooKeeper on the ZooKeeper node, and then perform a
            rolling restart of ZooKeeper on all other ZooKeeper nodes.
            A rolling restart of ZooKeeper means restart ZooKeeper on each
            node, one at a time, pausing until the last restart finishes
            before beginning the next. Restart the ZooKeeper leader last.
    9. Verify that the new node joined the ZooKeeper quorum.
% service mapr-zookeeper qstatus
   10. Perform a rolling restart of Warden on all the nodes.
   11. Check that all nodes appear in the output of the node list command.
       You might have to wait a few minutes until all nodes are registered
       before you get output from this command.
% maprcli node list -columns ip
