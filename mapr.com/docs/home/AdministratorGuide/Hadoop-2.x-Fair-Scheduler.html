Hadoop 2.x Fair Scheduler

   The FairScheduler is a pluggable scheduler for Hadoop that allows YARN
   applications to share resources in a large cluster fairly. Fair
   scheduling is a method of assigning resources to applications such that
   all applications get, on average, an equal share of resources over
   time. Hadoop 2.x is capable of scheduling multiple resource types.

   By default, the Fair Scheduler bases scheduling fairness decisions only
   on memory. It can be configured to schedule resources based on memory,
   CPU, and disk usage. When only one application is running, that
   application uses the entire cluster. When other applications are
   submitted, resources that free up are assigned to the new applications,
   so that each application eventually gets approximately the same amount
   of resources. Unlike the default Hadoop scheduler, which forms a queue
   of applications, this lets short applications finish in reasonable time
   while not starving long-lived applications. It is also a reasonable way
   to share a cluster between a number of users. Finally, fair sharing
   also uses priorities applied as weights to determine the fraction of
   total resources that each application should get.
