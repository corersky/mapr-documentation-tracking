Tuning the Cache for FUSE-Based POSIX Client

   Describes performance tuning measures for FUSE clients.

   The FUSE kernel and the FUSE userspace process caches both data and
   metadata. When an application performs a read of a file using the
   FUSE-based POSIX client, data is generally returned from the local FUSE
   kernel cache if that portion of the file resides in cache from a
   previous read or write operation. However, if the file has been
   modified on the MapR cluster by a different client, the data in the
   local kernel cache may be stale. The illustration below shows the
   layers of cache — FUSE kernel cache (referred to as kCache), the FUSE
   userspace cache (referred to as uCache), MapR file system cache
   (referred to as mfsCache) — and the sections below describe how these
   affect reads and writes and how the FUSE attributes can be used to tune
   the caching behavior.

Inode Attribute Cache

   Inode attributes are cached in the FUSE kernel cache (kCache) and in
   the userspace cache (uCache). When the same file is accessed from
   multiple FUSE clients, writes on the file through one mountpoint may
   not be seen by other applications performing a read on the file
   (through a different client). The inode attributes are cached in the
   kernel because of which another application modifying the file might
   not see the updates instantly. For example, the inode attributes, such
   as size, modification timestamp (mtime), etc. of the file, in the
   kCache and uCache on Node A might be stale if the file is being
   modified concurrently by an application on Node B.
     * [1]Tuning the attribute timeout in kCache
     * [2]Tuning the attribute timeout in uCache

   The FUSE kernel refreshes inode attributes from the userspace FUSE
   process once every 3 seconds by default. This can be tuned through the
   fuse.attr.timeout parameter in the fuse.conf file. The
   fuse.attr.timeout parameter specifies the interval of time at which to
   refresh the inode attributes in kernel and can be used to minimize the
   amount of time it takes to refresh the cache. Even if fuse.attr.timeout
   is set to 0, Node A might still not see the latest writes from Node B
   because there is cached metadata in the userspace FUSE process on Node
   A; metadata can be served from the uCache and the application might not
   see current updates for attributes like size. To see the latest changes
   on a file, see [3]Tuning the attribute timeout in uCache.
   The userspace FUSE process caches both data and metadata and refreshes
   the inode attributes from the MapR file system once every 3 seconds;
   this is not tunable. Even if the fuse.attr.timeout is set to 0, because
   there is cached data and metadata in the userspace FUSE process
   (uCache), stale data or metadata can be served from the userspace FUSE
   process, which only refreshes inode attributes every 3 seconds.
   However, the userspace FUSE process updates the inode attributes every
   time a file is opened. To see the latest changes on a file,
   applications, especially readers on a file, that require to see updates
   on the file within 3 seconds can close and open the file to refresh the
   attributes and see instant updates.

Readdir Cache

   Directory entries (files within a directory) are not cached in the
   uCache, but are cached in the kCache. The kCache can be stale on Node A
   if there are files being created in the directory by an application
   from the mountpoint on Node B. That is, a user listing directory
   entries on Node A for a directory (using a command like ls) might not
   see the files that were just created from Node B.

   Tuning the entry timeout in kCache
          The fuse.entry.timeout parameter specifies the interval of time
          at which to refresh the readdir (or lookup) cache in the kernel
          (kCache). The default value is 3 seconds and this can be
          configured in the fuse.conf file.

Data Cache

   By default:
     * Reads are buffered both in the kCache and the uCache.
     * Writes are not buffered in the kCache, but are buffered in the
       uCache.

   Application trying to read a file on Node A might not see the latest
   updates to the file (written from node B) for the following reasons:
     * Reads on Node A might have been served either from the kCache or
       the uCache of Node A.
       See [4]Tuning the cache for reads for information on invalidating
       the cache.
     * The writes might have been buffered in the uCache of Node B.
       See [5]Tuning the cache for writes for information on disabling
       buffering at a file level or altogether.

   Tuning the cache for reads

          + [6]Tuning the kCache
          + [7]Tuning the uCache

          The fuse.auto.inval.data parameter specifies whether or not to
          automatically invalidate the kCache for any data change, which
          causes mtime change, on the files. If enabled, any mtime update
          on the file automatically invalidates the page cache of the
          file. The mtime is an inode attribute; for information on
          refreshing the cache for inode attributes, see Inode Attributes.

          Every read cache page is valid for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds,
          the read cache page is dropped from uCache. This is not tunable.

   Tuning the cache for writes

          + [8]Tuning the kCache
          + [9]Tuning the uCache

          The fuse.writeback.cache parameter specifies whether to buffer
          writes in the kernel or to perform a write through. If enabled,
          the writes are buffered in the kernel. If disabled, writes are
          not buffered in the kernel and are directly sent to the FUSE
          process.

          By default, writeback caching is disabled; that is, the kernel
          sends all writes to FUSE process directly. If an application
          does small writes, then the FUSE process might run out of CPU
          because of the overhead involved in small writes. To mitigate
          this, the FUSE kernel can be configured to enable caching in the
          kernel using the fuse.writeback.cache attribute. However, this
          can be enabled only on kernels running version >= 3.15.

          The fuse.flush.inline attribute can be used to disable data
          buffering in the uCache. By default, the userspace FUSE process
          caches the writes locally. This parameter specifies whether to
          cache writes (for up to 3 seconds or 64KB in size) or write
          directly to server. This can be disabled at both the file and
          FUSE process levels.

          If the application does buffering before writing to filesystem,
          to avoid redundant buffering, you can disable buffering at the
          FUSE level by setting the fuse.flush.inline parameter value to 1
          in the fuse.conf file. Caching can be disabled at a file-level
          by opening the file in O_DIRECT mode.

Caching Negative Lookup Results

   FUSE issues thousands of lookup calls for the file, even when the
   initial lookup call has returned ENOENT, indicating that the file that
   does not exist, This behaviour is in contrast to NFS, which caches the
   lookup result for a specified time. For example, when running a git
   clone operation on the mapr-core repository, testing indicated that
   FUSE issued 870k calls, while NFS issued 82K calls, for files that are
   non-existent.

   To reduce the number of these negative lookups, and optimize
   performance, the fuse.negative.timeout parameter has been added to the
   FUSE configuration. For MapR 6.0.1, install EBF patch version
   6.0.1.20180404222005.GA‌-20190208030353 or above, to use this cache.

   By default, this parameter is set to 3 seconds. Negative lookup results
   that are returned when a file does not exist (lookup retuned ENOENT),
   are cached for 3 seconds. The lookup is performed again, only after
   this period elapses. The file is deemed to be non-existent till this
   period elapses.

   For more information on this parameter, check the [10]FUSE
   configuration.
