Removing Cluster Permissions

   You can modify cluster permissions using MCS or the CLI.

Removing Cluster Permissions Using the MapR Control System

   Compete the following steps to remove cluster permissions in the MapR
   Control System:
    1. Log in to MCS and click Admin > User Settings > Permissions.
    2. Remove the desired permissions:
          + To remove all permissions for a user or group, click
            [deleteRow.png] associated with the row.
          + To change the permissions for a user or group, deselect the
            checkbox associated with the permissions you wish to revoke
            from the user or group.
    3. Click Save Changes to save the changes.

Removing Cluster Permissions Using the CLI or REST API

   The acl set command specifies the entire ACL for a cluster or volume.
   Any previous permissions are overwritten by the new values, and any
   permissions omitted are removed. To remove cluster permissions, run the
   acl set command and omit the permissions to remove. See [1]acl set for
   complete reference information.
