Configuring the Linux NFS Client

   The default RPC requests configuration can negatively impact
   performance and memory. To avoid performance and memory issues,
   configure the number of outstanding RPC requests to the NFS server to
   be 128.

   Perform the following steps as the root user on each NFS client
   machine:
    1. To enable the configuration to persist after a reboot of the NFS
       client machine, issue the following commands to create the
       sunrpc.conf file under /etc/modprobe.d with the recommended
       configuration:
echo "options sunrpc tcp_slot_table_entries=128" >> /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf
echo "options sunrpc tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128" >> /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.c
onf
    2. To enable the configuration to take effect after you remount the
       NFS client to the NFS gateway, issue the following echo commands:
echo 128 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_slot_table_entries
echo 128 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_max_slot_table_entries
    3. Remount the NFS client to the NFS gateway. For example, the
       following commands unmount and mount the NFS assuming that the
       cluster is mounted at /mapr:
# umount /mapr
# mount -o hard,nolock <hostname>:/mapr /mapr
       Note: Failure to configure this property may result in the
       following error in /opt/mapr/logs/nfsserver.log:
ERROR nfsserver[38960] fs/nfsd/requesthandle.cc:791 0.0.0.0[0]
cannot allocate more OncRpcContexts: [numDropped=2556001]
dropping connection from nfsc=10.13.64.225:0
       Tip: For CentOS, after the reboot of the node, if the
       /proc/sys/sunrpc directory is not available or if rpcidmapd is not
       running, start the rpcidmapd service using the following command:
service rpcidmapd start
