Recovery for the ResourceManager

   After a restart or failover, the active ResourceManager recovers the
   ResourceManager state based on the checkpoints provided in the
   ResourceManager state store. During recovery, the ResourceManager
   resumes applications and tasks that were running prior to the failover
   but were not completed.

   Two implementations of the ResourceManager state store are available:
     * FileSystemRMStateStore. Enables implicit write access to a single
       ResourceManager node. MapR Filesystem provides fencing implicitly
       and its state store implementation provides better scalability and
       failover performance than the ZKRMStateStore. The state store is
       also naturally protected by MapR Filesystem replication. By
       default, FileSystemRMStateStore is the state store implementation
       for the ResourceManager and the ResourceManager state store is
       maintained in the following MapR file system volume:
       /var/mapr/cluster/yarn/rm/system.
     * ZKRMStateStore. Enables implicit write access to a single
       ResourceManager node. This is usually recommended for HA
       implementations where YARN is running on HDFS. However,
       FileSystemRMStateStore is recommended in a MapR cluster.

   Note: For recovery to occur,all ResourceManager nodes must have access
   to the ResourceManager state store.
