Addressing Data Alarms

   When a disk fails, data on that disk becomes unavailable. As a result,
   you will probably see one of these two data alarms along with a Disk
   Failure alarm:
     * Data Unavailable (VOLUME_ALARM_DATA_UNAVAILABLE) - if there was
       only one copy of data and it was on the failed disk; or if data was
       replicated more than once, but all disks with that data failed
     * Data Under Replicated (VOLUME_ALARM_DATA_UNDER_REPLICATED) - if
       data on the failed disk is replicated elsewhere, but the minimum
       replication factor is not met as a result of the failed disk

   If you see a Data Unavailable volume alarm in the cluster, follow these
   steps to run the/opt/mapr/server/fsck utility on all the offline
   storage pools. On each node in the cluster that has raised a disk
   failure alarm:
    1. Run the following command to identify which storage pools are
       offline:
[user@host] /opt/mapr/server/mrconfig sp list | grep Offline
    2. For each storage pool reported by the previous command, run the
       following command, where <sp> specifies the name of an offline
       storage pool:
[user@host] /opt/mapr/server/fsck -n <sp> -r
       When you run [1]fsck with the -r option, the fsck utility
       identifies corrupt blocks and removes them. If there are no corrupt
       blocks, fsck clears the error condition so you can bring the
       storage pool back online.
       Note: Using the /opt/mapr/server/fsck utility with the -r flag to
       repair a filesystem risks data loss. Call MapR support before using
       /opt/mapr/server/fsck -r.
    3. Verify that all Data Unavailable volume alarms are cleared. If Data
       Unavailable volume alarms persist, contact MapR support or post on
       [2]answers.mapr.com.

   If there are any Data Under Replicated volume alarms in the cluster,
   MapR can repair the problem by automatically replicating data and
   putting it on another disk. After you allow a reasonable amount of time
   for re-replication, verify that the under-replication alarms are
   cleared.

   Using the /opt/mapr/server/fsck utility with the -r option produces
   different results depending on the scenario. The fsck utility does not
   interpret the scenario nor does it have a safe mode.
     * If a disk is offline because of an imbalanced b-tree, using fsck -r
       may result in data loss from bad containers and data loss if
       additional replicas are unavailable.
     * If a disk is offline because of an I/O error, using fsck -r
       produces indeterminate results. A disk that is throwing I/O errors
       is questionable in terms of data content and reliability. For
       example, an operation that completed on the disk but was never
       returned may have partial data remaining on the disk. Using fsck -r
       retains any partial data.
     * If a disk is offline because of a slow I/O, using fsck -r does not
       produce data loss.

   The most conservative usage of fsck -r is to run fsck without the -r
   option (verification mode) and check the output. If the output is ok,
   then run fsck with the -roption.
   Note: Disk Failure node alarms that persist require disk replacement.
   If Data Under Replicated volume alarms persist, contact MapR support or
   post on [3]answers.mapr.com.
