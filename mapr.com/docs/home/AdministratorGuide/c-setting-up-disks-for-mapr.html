Setting Up Disks for MapR

   This section describes how to set up disks during the normal
   installation process. Go to the [1]disksetup command page for
   information about other uses of this command.
   MapR formats and uses disks for the Lockless Storage Services layer
   (MapR Filesystem), and records these disks in the file [2]disktab. In a
   production environment, or when testing performance, MapR should be
   configured to use physical hard drives and partitions. In some cases,
   it is necessary to reinstall the operating system on a node so that the
   physical hard drives are available for direct use by MapR. Reinstalling
   the operating system provides an unrestricted opportunity to configure
   the hard drives. If the installation procedure assigns hard drives to
   be managed by the Linux [3]Logical Volume Manager (LVM) by default, you
   should explicitly remove the drives you plan to use with MapR from the
   LVM configuration. It is common to let LVM manage one physical drive
   containing the operating system partition(s) and to leave the rest
   unmanaged by LVM for use with MapR.
   Note: It is not necessary to set up RAID (Redundant Array of
   Independent Disks) on disks used by MapR Filesystem. MapR uses the
   disksetup script to set up storage pools. In most cases, you should let
   MapR calculate storage pools using the default stripe width of two or
   three disks. If you anticipate a high volume of random-access I/O, you
   can use the -W option with disksetup to specify larger storage pools of
   up to 8 disks each.
   The following procedures are intended for use on physical clusters or
   Amazon EC2 instances. On EC2 instances, EBS volumes can be used as MapR
   storage, although performance will be slow.
   Note: If you are using [4]MapR on Amazon EMR, you do not have to use
   this procedure; the disks are set up for you automatically.
