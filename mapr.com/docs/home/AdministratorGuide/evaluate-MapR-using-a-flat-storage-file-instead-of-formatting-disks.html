Evaluate MapR using a flat storage file instead of formatting disks

   When setting up a small cluster for evaluation purposes, if a
   particular node does not have physical disks or partitions available to
   dedicate to the cluster, you can use a flat file on an existing disk
   partition as the node's storage. Create at least a 16GB file, and
   include a path to the file in the disk list file for the [1]disksetup
   script.
   The following example creates a 20 GB flat file (bs=1G specifies 1
   gigabyte blocks, multiplied by count=20) at /root/storagefile:
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/storagefile bs=1G count=20

   Then, you would add the following to the disk list file /tmp/disks.txt
   to be used by disksetup:
/root/storagefile
