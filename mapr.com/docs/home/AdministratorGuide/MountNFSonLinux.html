Mounting NFS on a Linux Client

   You can automatically or manually mount NFS on a Linux client when your
   system starts up.

   Automatically Mount

   Use this procedure to automatically mount to NFS on a Linux client when
   your system starts up.
   Add an NFS mount to /etc/fstab.
# device          mountpoint      fs-type      options      dump fsckorder
...
usa-node01:/mapr  /mapr           nfs          rw           0    0
...

   Manually Mount
   Use this procedure to manually mount to NFS on a Linux client.
    1. Install the NFS client.
          + sudo yum install nfs-utils (Red Hat or CentOS)
          + sudo apt-get install nfs-common (Ubuntu)
          + sudo zypper install nfs-client (SUSE)
    2. List the NFS shares exported on the server. For example:
showmount -e usa-node01
    3. Set up a mount point for an NFS share. For example:
sudo mkdir /mapr
    4. Mount the cluster via NFS.
sudo mount -o hard,nolock usa-node01:/mapr /mapr
       Note: The mount point does not persist after reboot when you mount
       manually from the command line.
