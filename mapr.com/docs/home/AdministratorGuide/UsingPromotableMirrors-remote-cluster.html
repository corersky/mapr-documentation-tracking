Setting up Mirroring to a Remote Cluster

   Once data volumes are created in a primary datacenter, the MapR
   administrator creates mirror volumes in a remote secondary datacenter.
   The following diagram illustrates the mirror relationship between these
   two volumes:

   Note: When you use promotable mirrors, the volumes on the destination
   cluster must be set up in the same way as on the primary site. This
   means that volume names are the same and mount points are the same. If
   a hierarchical mounting structure (such as /A/B) is used on the primary
   site, the same structure must be recreated once mirror volumes are
   promoted at the secondary site.

   mirroring to a remote cluster:
