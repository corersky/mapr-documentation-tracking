Managing Schedules

   A schedule is a group of rules that specify recurring points in time at
   which certain actions are determined to occur. You can use schedules to
   automate the creation of snapshots and mirrors; after you create a
   schedule, it appears as a choice in the scheduling menu when you are
   [1]creating or [2]editing a volume.

   When you specify a snapshot schedule on a mirror volume, it specifies
   how often to take a snapshot of the mirror volume. This snapshot
   schedule is distinct from the snapshot schedule for the standard
   volume. A snapshot schedule for a promotable mirror volume has two
   purposes:
     * It specifies how often to take a snapshot of the mirror volume for
       the purpose of preserving the state of the mirror before a
       subsequent mirror operation. This way, if corrupt data is copied
       from the source volume's snapshot into the mirror volume, the
       mirror contents can be rolled back to the snapshot.
     * If the promotable mirror volume is promoted to a read-write volume,
       the snapshot schedule specified for the mirror is used for the
       promoted read-write volume. Once a mirror volume is promoted to a
       read-write volume, the mirror schedule is disabled.

   A mirror schedule specifies how frequently the mirror volume is
   synchronized with the source volume. In case of a disaster (or any type
   of data loss on a read-write source volume), the data can be recovered
   from the mirror volume, but any data written to the source volume since
   the last successful mirror operation will not be on the mirror volume.
   Therefore, you should set the mirror schedule such that it meets your
   RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
