YARN Container Resources for MapReduce Version 2 Applications

   In addition to the YARN container resource allocation parameters, the
   MapReduce ApplicationMaster also considers the following container
   requirements when it sends requests to the ResourceManager for
   containers to run MapReduce applications:
   Parameter Default Description

   mapreduce.map.memory.mb
   1024 Defines the container size for map tasks in MB.
   mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb 3072

   Defines the container size for reduce tasks in MB.
   mapreduce.reduce.java.opts -Xmx2560m Java options for reduce tasks.
   mapreduce.map.java.opts -Xmx900m Java options for map tasks.

   mapreduce.map.disk
   0.5

   Defines the number of disks a map task requires. For example, a node
   with 4 disks can run 8 map tasks at a time. Note: If I/O intensive
   tasks do not run on the node, you may want to change this value.

   mapreduce.reduce.disk
   1.33

   Defines the number of disks that a reduce task requires. For example, a
   node with 4 disks can run 3 reduce tasks at a time. Note: If I/O
   intensive tasks do not run on the node, you might want to change this
   value.

   You can use one of the following methods to change the default
   configuration:
     * Provide updated values in the mapred-site.xml file on the node that
       runs the job. You can use central configuration to change this
       value on each node that runs the NodeManager in the cluster. Then,
       restart NodeManager on each node in the cluster. The
       mapred-site.xml file for MapReduce ve applications is located in
       the following directory: opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/etc/hadoop

     * Override the default values from the command line for each
       application that requires a non-default value.
