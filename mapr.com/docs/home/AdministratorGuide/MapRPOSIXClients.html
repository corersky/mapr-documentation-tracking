Managing MapR POSIX Clients

   The MapR POSIX Clients allow app servers, web servers, and other client
   nodes and apps to read and write data directly and securely to a MapR
   cluster. The following topics describe the steps for configuring and
   managing loopbackNFS POSIX and FUSE-based POSIX clients.

   Apart from the clients that are EOL, all others are supported. However,
   newer clients might have features that may not be supported in older
   clients.
