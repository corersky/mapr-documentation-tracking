Adding a Service to an Existing Node

   The process of adding a service to a node is similar to the initial
   installation process for nodes. For further detail see [1]Installing
   MapR Software.
    1. Install the package(s) corresponding to the new role(s) using
       apt-get or yum.
    2. Run [2]configure.sh with a list of the CLDB nodes and ZooKeeper
       nodes in the cluster.
    3. If you added the CLDB or ZooKeeper role, you must run
       [3]configure.sh on all other nodes in the cluster.
    4. If you added the fileserver role, run [4]disksetup to format and
       prepare disks for use as storage.
    5. Restart Warden.
% service mapr-warden restart

   When Warden restarts, it picks up the new configuration and starts the
   new services, making them active in the cluster.
