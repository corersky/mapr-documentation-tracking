MapR Monitoring Tips and Troubleshooting

Monitoring a Secure Cluster

   After regenerating the MapR user ticket, service failures occur for
          collectd and OpenTSDB
          If you delete or regenerate the MapR user ticket, the running
          collectd and OpenTSDB services will fail. After updating the
          MapR user ticket, restart the collectd and OpenTSDB services.

Monitoring Logs

   I notice a sudden increase in fluentd logs. What can I do?
          A sudden increase in the log file for fluentd could mean that a
          feedback loop is occurring where fluentd logs an error in the
          log file for a fluentd issue and that log entry causes yet
          another error when fluentd tries to parse it. In this case,
          consider disabling the index of fluentd logs. See [1]Configure
          Which Logs to Index.

Monitoring Metrics

   Where should I store the Elasticsearch index?
          Elasticsearch requires a lot of disk space. Also, when you
          upgrade Elasticsearch, the default index directory is removed
          along with the package update. Therefore, it is recommended to
          configure a separate file system for the index data. It is not
          recommended to store index data under the / or the /var file
          system.

          Note: If you store the Elasticsearch index on a filesystem that
          is locally hosted, you will be able to access logs in the event
          that the MapR cluster is not available.
          For more information about the Elasticsearch index and the
          default index directory, see [2]Log Aggregation and Storage.
