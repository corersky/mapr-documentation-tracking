Copying Configuration Files from a Server Node

   Settings in the nfsserver.conf and mapr-clusters.conf files on server
   nodes in the MapR cluster are also needed by the POSIX client. Complete
   the following steps to copy configuration files from a server node:
    1. On a server node in the MapR cluster, locate the nfsserver.conf and
       mapr-clusters.conf files in the /opt/mapr/conf/ directory.
    2. Copy both of those files to the /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs/conf/
       directory on the client machine.
