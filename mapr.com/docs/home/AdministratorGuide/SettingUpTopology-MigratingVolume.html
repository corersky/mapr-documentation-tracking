Migrating a Volume off a Node Using the CLI

   When you need to migrate a data volume off a particular node, move that
   node from the /data path to the /decommissioned path to avoid data
   under-replication.
     * Establish a /data topology path to serve as the default topology
       path for the volumes in that cluster.
     * Establish a /decommissioned topology path that is not assigned to
       any volumes.

   Tip: It is recommended that CLDB and ZooKeeper nodes are not in the
   same topology as the data nodes to ensure fast failover of the failed
   data node in the event of a data node failure.

   Since no data volumes are assigned to that topology path, standard data
   replication will migrate the data off that node to other nodes that are
   still in the /data topology path.

   You can run the following command to check if a given volume is present
   on a specified node:
maprcli dump volumenodes -volumename <volume> -json | grep <ip:port>

   Run this command for each non-local volume in your cluster. Once all
   the data has migrated off the node, you can decommission the node or
   place it in maintenance mode.

   If you need to segregate CLDB data, create a /cldb topology node and
   move the CLDB nodes under /cldb. Point the topology for the CLDB volume
   (mapr.cldb.internal) to /cldb. See [1]Isolating CLDB Nodes for details.
   Note: To move an existing volume to another topology, you must have the
   [2]Converged Enterprise Edition. Without the Converged Enterprise
   Edition, when you run the [3]maprcli volume move command to move a
   volume to another topology, the following error message is returned:
ERROR (10010) - Volume Move: No license for requested operation
