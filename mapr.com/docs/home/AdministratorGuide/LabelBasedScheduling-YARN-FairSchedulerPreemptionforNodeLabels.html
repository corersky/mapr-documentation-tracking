YARN Resource Calculation Based on Labels

   MapR 6.1.0 implements correct steady/instantaneous Fair Scheduler
   shares, headroom, and maximum resource calculation for queues with
   label-based scheduling (LBS).
   This new approach to YARN resource allocation enables the cluster LBS
   configuration to compute the resources that are allowed for each queue.
   It also uses LBS to assign configurations containers to the correct
   queues to preempt containers, and to prevent resource overuse. The LBS
   approach to YARN resource allocation relies on:
    1. Resource computation (memory, CPU, disks) based on labels for each
       queue.
    2. Per-label preemption threshold.

   Example of LBS Resource Computation

   For example, imagine that you have the following resources:
   [YARN-73_1.png]

   Using the former fair-share resource distribution results in the
   following:
   [YARN-73_2.png]

   Using the new LBS resource distribution results in the following:
   [YARN-73_3.png]

Understanding LBS preemption thresholds

   No preemptions are done until the cluster is 80% loaded (by default
   yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption.cluster-utilization-threshold=0.8f). By
   per-label preemption threshold, total resource usage and total
   available resources for every label is calculated to make decisions on
   preemption independently for every label.
                            Old behavior                          New behavior
   Preemption can happen only when a whole cluster is 80% loaded.
   Preemption can happen when a label resource is 80% loaded in queues
   that use this label.
   Note: YARN resource allocation remains unchanged if LBS is not used.

New Properties

    1. defaultQueueLabel
       This label is assigned to all queues that do not have a label
       (excluding the root queue) and for all new queues that are created
       in runtime.
       This differs from a label for the root queue in that if you specify
       a label for the root queue then root and all child queues can use
       resources only from nodes that are marked with this label. All
       queues (excluding root) which do not have a label are assigned the
       defaultQueueLabel label.
       For example, root.%username% queue is created if you submit a new
       job without queue information and property
       yarn.scheduler.fair.user-as-default-queue is true.
       You can specify this property in fair-scheduler.xml:
<allocations>
  <defaultQueueLabel>LabelA</defaultQueueLabel>
  <queue name="root">
           ...
  <queue name="queue1">
  </queue>
  <queue name="queue2">
    <label>LabelB</label>
   </queue>
           ...
  </queue>
</allocations>
       See [1]Specifying Fair Scheduler Configuration Properties in
       yarn-site.xml for more information.
    2. yarn.scheduler.fair.resources-based-on-labels-enabled
       This property is used to enable or disable recomputing of fair
       shares based on labels. It allows container allocation on all
       nodes.
       You can specify this property in yarn-site.xml:
<property>
  <name>yarn.scheduler.fair.resources-based-on-labels-enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>
    3. yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption.cluster-utilization-threshold.based-
       on-labels-enabled
       This property allows enabling/disabling preemption of the threshold
       per-label. Recomputing of resources and preemption threshold based
       on labels is disabled by default. To change behavior and start
       —Åontainers preemptions when the threshold of the label is exceeded,
       change this property to true.
       You can specify this property in yarn-site.xml:
<property>
  <name>yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption.cluster-utilization-threshold.based-on-la
bels-enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>

   See [2]Specifying Fair Scheduler Configuration Properties in
   yarn-site.xml for more information.

Limitations

   Here are some constraints for label configurations:
    1. Multiple labels for a node and label expression at the queue level
       are not supported.
    2. All queues should have some label (own or inherited from parents)
       except the root queue (label can be null) but including the default
       queue (otherwise this queue would not get any resources). The
       default label should be one of the existing labels.
