YARN Resource Calculation Based on Labels

   MapR 6.1.0 implements correct steady/instantaneous Fair Scheduler
   shares, headroom, and maximum resource calculation for queues with
   label-based scheduling (LBS).
   This new approach to YARN resource allocation enables the cluster LBS
   configuration to compute the resources that are allowed for each queue.
   It also uses LBS to assign containers to the correct queues to preempt
   containers, and to prevent resource overuse. The LBS approach to YARN
   resource allocation relies on:
    1. Resource computation (memory, CPU, disks) based on labels for each
       queue.
    2. Per-label preemption threshold.

   Example of LBS Resource Computation

   For example, imagine that you have the following resources:
   [YARN-73_1.png]

   Using the former fair-share resource distribution results in the
   following:
   [YARN-73_2.png]

   Using the new LBS resource distribution results in the following:
   [YARN-73_3.png]

Understanding LBS preemption thresholds

   Before LBS, preemption occurred by default when an entire cluster
   became 80% full
   (yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption.cluster-utilization-threshold=0.8f).
   With LBS, preemption occurs per labeled resource, as that resource
   becomes 80% full.

Descriptions of New Properties When Using LBS

     * defaultQueueLabel
       Assigned to all new queues and existing queues that do not have a
       label (excluding the root queue).
       For example, root.%username% queue is created if you submit a new
       job without queue information and property
       yarn.scheduler.fair.user-as-default-queue is true.
       You can specify this property in fair-scheduler.xml:
<allocations>
  <defaultQueueLabel>LabelA</defaultQueueLabel>
  <queue name="root">
           ...
  <queue name="queue1">
  </queue>
  <queue name="queue2">
    <label>LabelB</label>
   </queue>
           ...
  </queue>
</allocations>
       See [1]Specifying Fair Scheduler Configuration Properties in
       yarn-site.xml for more information.
     * yarn.scheduler.fair.resources-based-on-labels-enabled
       Used to enable or disable recomputing of fair shares based on
       labels. It allows container allocation on all nodes.
       You can specify this property in yarn-site.xml:
<property>
  <name>yarn.scheduler.fair.resources-based-on-labels-enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>
     * yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption.cluster-utilization-threshold.based-
       on-labels-enabled
       Allows enabling or disabling (default) preemption of the threshold
       per-label. To overcome the default and start container preemption
       when the threshold of the label is exceeded, change this property
       to true.
       You can specify this property in yarn-site.xml:
<property>
  <name>yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption.cluster-utilization-threshold.based-on-la
bels-enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>

   See [2]Specifying Fair Scheduler Configuration Properties in
   yarn-site.xml for more information.

LBS Requirements and Restrictions?

   Before you adopt LBS, you should be aware of two issues:
     * Multiple labels for a node and label expression at the queue level
       are not supported.
     * Except for root, all queues including the default, must be labeled,
       either independent or through inheritance.
