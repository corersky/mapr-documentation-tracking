Configure NFS Write Performance

   The default Remote Procedure Call (RPC) requests configuration can
   negatively impact performance and memory. To avoid performance and
   memory issues, configure the number of outstanding RPC requests to the
   NFS server to be 128, for optimal performance. The NFS client uses this
   value to determine when to send requests to the NFS server, along with
   the number of parallel requests to send.
     * If the value is too small, the NFS client does not send many
       parallel requests. This scenario results in decreased performance.
     * If the value is too high, the NFS client sends a lot of parallel
       requests, but the NFS server discards some requests, as it has a
       limit on the number of requests it can handle. This scenario causes
       the NFS client to resend the requests, and negatively affects
       performance.

   The kernel tunable value sunrpc.tcp_slot_table_entries represents the
   number of simultaneous RPC requests. The default value of this tunable
   is 16 (on Red Hat versions prior to version 6.3). On Red Hat versions
   6.3 and above, the default value of this tunable is set at 65536.
   Increasing or decreasing this value to 128 (depending on the Red Hat
   version in use), may improve write speeds. Use the command sysctl -w
   sunrpc.tcp_slot_table_entries=128 to set the value. Add an entry to
   your sysctl.conf file to make the setting persist across reboots.

   Perform the following steps as the root user, on each NFS client
   machine:
    1. Issue the following commands to create the sunrpc.conf file under
       /etc/modprobe.d with the recommended configuration. These commands
       enable the configuration to persist after a reboot of the NFS
       client machine.
echo "options sunrpc tcp_slot_table_entries=128" >> /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.conf
echo "options sunrpc tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128" >>  /etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc.
conf

    2. Issue the following echo commands. These commands enable the
       configuration to take effect after you remount the NFS client to
       the NFS gateway.
echo 128 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_slot_table_entries
echo 128 > /proc/sys/sunrpc/tcp_max_slot_table_entries
    3. Remount the NFS client to the NFS gateway. Mount the MapR NFS
       server with a rsize and wsize of 128K, as this value significantly
       cuts down NFS server requests for a given transfer, and improves
       the overall performance. For example, the following commands
       unmount and mount the NFS server, assuming that the cluster is
       mounted at /mapr.
# umount /mapr
# mount -o nolock,rsize=131072,wsize=131072 <hostname>:/mapr /mapr
    4. After rebooting the node, if the /proc/sys/sunrpc directory is not
       available, or if rpcidmapd is not running, start the rpcidmapd
       service, using the following command: service rpcidmapd start.

   Failure to set this tunable to an optimum value, may result in the
   following error in /opt/mapr/logs/nfsserver.log file:
ERROR nfsserver[38960] fs/nfsd/requesthandle.cc:791 0.0.0.0[0] cannot allocate m
ore OncRpcContexts: [numDropped=2556001] dropping connection from nfsc=10.13.64.

   NFS write performance varies between different Linux distributions. The
   recommended value of this tunable may have no effect, or even a
   negative effect on your particular cluster.
