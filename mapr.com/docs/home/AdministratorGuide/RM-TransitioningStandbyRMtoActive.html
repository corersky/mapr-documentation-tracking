Transitioning a Standby ResourceManager to Active

   The yarn rmadmin command includes options to manage high availability
   for the ResourceManager, including transitioning a ResourceManager node
   between active and standby modes. These commands take the
   ResourceManager service ID as an argument and can be run on any node in
   the cluster. The serviceID of a ResourceManager is set in the
   yarn.resourcemanager.ha.rm-ids property of the yarn-site.xml file.

   Transition a standby ResourceManager to the active state when the
   active ResourceManager process has failed or the node that runs the
   process is no longer accessible.
    1. Determine if an active ResourceManager is running in the cluster.
       See [1]Checking the ResourceManager State.
    2. Run the following command to set the current active ResourceManager
       to standby: yarn rmadmin -transitionToStandby <serviceID>
 yarn rmadmin -transitionToStandby <serviceID>
    3. Run the following command to transition the standby ResourceManager
       to the active state: yarn rmadmin -transitionToActive <serviceID>
yarn rmadmin -transitionToActive <serviceID>
