ResourceManager High Availability

   The ResourceManager service tracks a cluster's resources and schedules
   YARN applications. Configure high availability for the ResourceManager
   so that the failure of the ResourceManager service is not a single
   point of failure for the cluster. The high availability of
   ResourceManager is based on the cluster configuration of the restart,
   recovery, and failover features.

Restart

   By default, the Warden attempts to restart a failed service three
   times. You can configure the frequency that Warden attempts to restart
   failed services before initializing failover in the warden.conf file.
   For more information, see [1]warden.conf.

Recovery

   When a ResourceManager restarts or fails over, the active
   ResourceManager can recover the state of the previously running
   ResourceManager. By default, ResourceManager recovery is enabled and it
   uses the FileSystemRMStateStore implementation to store the
   ResourceManager state in the MapR Filesystem. You can configure the
   ResourceManager to have no recovery or you can enable the recovery. You
   can also configure the state store implementation that you want to use.
   For more information, see [2]Recovery for the ResourceManager.

Failover

   When a ResourceManager fails, the cluster can fail over the
   ResourceManager process to another node. To configure failover, the
   cluster must have one or more nodes with the ResourceManager role.
   Note:

   Starting in Version 4.0.2, zero configuration failover provides
   automatic failover without requiring that you specify the
   ResourceManager nodes when you run configure.sh. It also does not
   require any further configuration to yarn-site.xml.

   Upgrade any client nodes to the 4.0.2 client to ensure proper
   communication with the ResourceManager service. Earlier versions of the
   MapR client do not support the zero configuration feature.

   You can select one of the following failover implementations when you
   use the configure.sh utility to configure each node:
     * Zero Configuration Failover. With zero configuration failover, the
       ResourceManager process only runs on one node in the cluster. When
       the active ResourceManager fails, one of the standby
       ResourceManager nodes automatically loads the working state from
       the state store and continues providing services to the cluster.
       Zero configuration failover is the default, recommended setting for
       the following reasons:
          + Only one ResourceManager process consumes cluster resources.
            With the manual or automatic failover option, the active and
            standby ResourceManagers consume cluster resources.
          + Warden initiates failover automatically. With the manual
            failover, you need to manually run the [3]yarn rmadmin command
            for failover to occur.
          + Simplified clients connectivity. Clients identify the active
            ResourceManager with a single request to the Zookeeper. With
            the manual or automatic failover option, ResourceManager
            clients connect to each ResourceManager in a round-robin
            fashion until they locate the active ResourceManager; this
            results in delays when launching or querying jobs.
          + Consistent Configuration. All cluster nodes and clients can
            use the same yarn-site.xml configuration file. With manual or
            automatic failover, you must maintain a customized
            yarn-site.xml file for each node that runs the
            ResourceManager.
       For more information, see [4]Zero Configuration Failover for the
       ResourceManager.
     * Manual or Automatic Failover. With manual failover or automatic
       failover, one active ResourceManager and one or more standby
       Resource Managers run in the cluster. The standby ResourceManager
       nodes run the ResourceManager process without loading the working
       state. When the active ResourceManager fails, one of the standby
       ResourceManager nodes can load the working state from the state
       store and continue providing services to the cluster. For more
       information, see [5]Manual or Automatic Failover for the
       ResourceManager.

   You can perform the following procedures to manage ResourceManager:
