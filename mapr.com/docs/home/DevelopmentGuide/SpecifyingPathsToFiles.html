Specifying Paths to Files and Directories

   Many of the APIs require clients to pass a path to a file or directory.
   You can specify absolute paths or relative paths. Absolute paths must
   begin with a forward slash. Relative paths are relative to the working
   directory, which you can set by calling hdfsSetWorkingDirectory() and
   find out by calling hdfsGetWorkingDirectory(). Any path that does not
   begin with a forward slash is considered to be relative to the working
   directory.

   The maximum length of paths is 4096 bytes.

   You cannot specify paths to a cluster other than the cluster for the
   current connection. All paths are local to the cluster connected to.
   You can, however, explicitly connect to multiple clusters, as described
   in [1]Establishing Connections to MapR-FS.
