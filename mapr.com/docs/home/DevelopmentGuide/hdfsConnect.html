hdfsConnect()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Connects to a MapR-FS cluster.

   If a connection to the cluster in which the remote host is located
   already exists, the functions return a handle to this existing
   connection.

   If a connection to the cluster does not already exist, the functions
   return a handle to a new connection instance.

   Note that if default is used for the host parameter, this means connect
   to the first cluster listed in the MAPR_HOME/conf/mapr-clusters.conf
   file on the client.

   For more information about connections, see [1]Establishing Connections
   to MapR-FS.
