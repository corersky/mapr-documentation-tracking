Step 2: Write Data to MapR

   Depending on your use case, move existing data onto the platform or
   write data directly to the platform.

   You can write batch data or streaming data to the MapR Converged Data
   Platform. Batch data refers to data that is already in a data-store
   while streaming data refers to the continuous flow of real-time
   messages that have yet to be written to a data-store. Streaming data is
   generally processed as it is received while batch data is processed
   after a set of data is written to the datastore. There are many ways to
   write batch and streaming data to the platform, the following sections
   provide a few examples.

Write Batch Data to the Platform

   You can use an NFS client, hadoop command, or ecosystem components to
   write batch data to MapR-FS. Basic POSIX file system operations can be
   used to move data to MapR-FS. For example, you can use NFS clients,
   POSIX clients, or applications that utilize libraries such as java.io
   to access the filesystem. Hadoop commands and hdfs APIs can be used to
   add or update files on the MapR-FS. For example, you can use the hadoop
   distcp command to [1]copy data from HDFS to MapR-FS. Hadoop Ecosystem
   components, such as Apache Flume, can also be used to push log files to
   MapR-FS.

   You can also write, update, or delete batch data to MapR-DB tables.
   Applications can use the OJAI API to write to JSON tables or the HBase
   API to write to binary tables.

Write Streaming Data to the Platform

   Write streaming event data as messages in MapR Stream topics using
   Kafka API or a REST client application. [2]C, [3]Java, or [4]Python
   applications can produce messages to one or more topics in a MapR
   Stream. Additionally, applications written in any language can use the
   [5]REST Proxy to produce messages to one or more topics in a MapR
   Stream. For example, a financial service application, written in Java,
   could produce messages about stock market activity to a MapR Stream
   topic.
