hdfsRead()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Reads data from the current offset in an open file. After the read, the
   current offset is incremented by the number of bytes read.

   To read from a specific offset, first call hdfsSeek() to move to that
   offset in the file. Then, call hdfsRead().

   Alternatively, call hdfsPread(), specifying an offset in the call.
   hdfsPread() does not increment the current offset in the file. The
   offset that you specify in the call is used only for the read.

Signature

tSize hdfsRead(hdfsFS fs, hdfsFile file, void* buffer, tSize length)

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   fs The filesystem handle. Filesystem handle can be obtained using one
   of the hdfsConnect() APIs.
   file The file handle. Obtain this handle with one of the hdfsOpenFile()
   APIs.
   buffer The buffer to copy bytes into during the read.
   length The length of the buffer. The maximum length of the buffer is
   the maximum size of tSize.

Returned Value

   Returns the number of bytes actually read, which can be less than than
   the length of the buffer if the end of the file is reached during the
   read. Returns -1 on error.

   Check errno for error codes and meanings.
