Accessing MapR Filesystem with C Applications

   MapR provides a modified version of libhdfs that supports access to the
   MapR file system. You can develop applications with C that read files,
   write to files, change file permissions and file ownership, create and
   delete files and directories, rename files, and change the access and
   modification times of files and directories.

   libMapRClient supports and makes modifications to hadoop-2.x version of
   libhdfs. The API reference notes which APIs are supported by
   hadoop-2.x.

   libMapRClientâ€™s version of libhdfs contains the following changes and
   additions:
     * There are no calls to a JVM, so applications run faster and more
       efficiently.
     * Changes to APIs
          + hadoop-2.x: Support for hdfsBuilder structures for connections
            to HDFS is limited. Some of the parameters are ignored.
          + hadoop-2.x: hdfsGetDefaultBlockSize(): If the file system that
            the client is connected to is an instance of MapR Filesystem,
            the returned value is 256 MB, regardless of the actual
            setting.
          + hadoop-2.x: hdfsCreateDirectory(): The parameters for buffer
            size, replication, and block size are ignored for connections
            to MapR file system.
          + hadoop-2.x: hdfsGetDefaultBlockSizeAtPath(): If the file
            system that the client is connected to is an instance of MapR
            Filesystem, the returned value is 256 MB, regardless of the
            actual setting.
          + hadoop-2.x: hdfsOpenFile(): The parameters for buffer size and
            replication are ignored for connections to MapR file system.

     * APIs that are unique to libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x
          + hdfsCreateDirectory2()
          + hdfsGetNameContainerSizeBytes()
          + hdfsOpenFile2()
          + hdfsSetRpcTimeout()
          + hdfsSetThreads()
