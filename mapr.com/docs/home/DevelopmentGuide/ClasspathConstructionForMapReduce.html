Classpath Construction

   This section describes how the MapReduce classpath is constructed.

   The classpath that is used to run a MapReduce program is constructed
   based on how the program is submitted.

   When you submit an application from the command line, the classpath
   used to process the program is based on the following items in this
   order of priority:
    1. JARs in the program’s classpath, such as the hadoop 2.x or yarn
       classpath.
    2. JARs specified with the -libjar parameter which can be appended to
       hadoop jar or yarn jar commands.

   If an external application submits the application, the classpath that
   is used to process the jar file is based on the following items in this
   order of priority:
    1. JARs in the classpath of the external application.
    2. JARs in the program’s classpath, such as the hadoop 2.x or yarn
       classpath.
    3. JARs specified with -libjar parameter which can be appended to
       hadoop jar or yarn jar commands.
