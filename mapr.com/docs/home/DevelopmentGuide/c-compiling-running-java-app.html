Compiling and Running a Java Application

   You can compile and run the java application using JAR files from the
   MapR Maven repository or from the MapR installation.

   Using JARs from the MapR Maven Repository

   MapR publishes Maven artifacts from version 2.1.2 onward at
   http://repository.mapr.com/maven/. When compiling for MapR version
   4.0.1, add the following dependency to the project's pom.xml file:
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
  <artifactId>hadoop-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.4.1-mapr-1408</version>
</dependency>

   This dependency will pull the rest of the dependencies from MapR's
   Maven repository the next time you do a mvn clean install.The JAR that
   includes the maprfs library is a dependency for the hadoop-core
   artifact.

   For a complete list of MapR-provided artifacts and further details, see
   [1]Maven Repository and Artifacts for MapR.

   Using JARs from the MapR Installation

   The maprfs library is included in the hadoop classpath. Add the hadoop
   classpath to the JAVA classpath when you compile and run the java
   application.
     * Use the following command to compile the sample code:
javac -cp $(hadoop classpath) MapRTest.java
     * Use the following command to run the sample code:
java -cp .:$(hadoop classpath) MapRTest /test
