Compiling and Running a Java Application

   You can compile and run the Java application using JAR files from the
   MapR Maven repository or from the MapR installation.

   Using JARs from the MapR Maven Repository

   MapR Development publishes Maven artifacts from version 2.1.2 onward at
   [1]http://repository.mapr.com/maven/. When compiling for MapR 6.1, add
   the following dependency to the pom.xml file for your project:
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
  <artifactId>hadoop-common</artifactId>
  <version>2.7.0-mapr-1808</version>
</dependency>

   This dependency will pull the rest of the dependencies from the MapR
   Maven repository the next time you do a mvn clean install.The JAR that
   includes the maprfs library is a dependency for the hadoop-common
   artifact.

   For a complete list of MapR-provided artifacts and further details, see
   [2]Maven Artifacts for MapR.

   Using JARs from the MapR Installation

   The maprfs library is included in the hadoop classpath. Add the hadoop
   classpath to the JAVA classpath when you compile and run the Java
   application.
     * To compile the sample code, use the following command:
javac -cp $(hadoop classpath) MapRTest.java
     * To run the sample code, use the following command:
java -cp .:$(hadoop classpath) MapRTest /test
