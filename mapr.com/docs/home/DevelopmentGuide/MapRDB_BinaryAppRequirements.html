MapR Database Binary Application Requirements

   The following tables include the minimal node requirements for building
   and running MapR Database binary table applications.
     * [1]Java Applications
     * [2]C Applications

   Node Requirement Method(s) to Meet Requirement
   A connection to the MapR cluster.
   Select one of the following options:
     * Install and configure the MapR client.
     * Install the PACC and run an application container.
     * Use the MapR Filesystem JAR to connect to the cluster.

   For more information, see [3]Connect to the Cluster.
   The HBase client is installed.

   Install the HBase client. The HBase client is as part of the MEP
   installation. For more information, see [4]6.1 Installation.
   Note: The HBase client is include when you install PACC.
   HBase client library files are configured as an application dependency.

   When you build the application, use the Maven Repository to determine
   the dependencies. The POM file should include the MapR Repository and
   the HBase client dependency.

   When you run an application, include the hbase classpath script and
   additional dependencies in the application's classpath.

   For more information, see [5]Compiling and Running MapR Database Binary
   Applications
   Other Items

   If an ecosystem component, such as Spark, runs or integrates with the
   application, you may need to include additional dependencies in the POM
   file.
   Node Requirement Method(s) to Meet Requirement
   A connection to the MapR cluster.
   Select one of the following options:
     * Install and configure the MapR client.
     * Install the PACC and run an application container.
     * Use the MapR Filesystem JAR to connect to the cluster.

   For more information, see [6]Connect to the Cluster.
   The HBase Client is installed.

   Install the HBase client. The HBase client is as part of the MEP
   installation. For more information, see [7]6.1 Installation.
   Note: The HBase client is include when you install PACC.
   The libMapRClient library and libjvm shared libraries are in the
   applicationâ€™s library search path and the libMapRClient header files
   are in this directory:/opt/mapr/include/hbase

   For more information, see [8]Building and Launching C Applications.
