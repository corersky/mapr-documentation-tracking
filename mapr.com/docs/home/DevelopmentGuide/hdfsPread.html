hdfsPread()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Reads an open file from a specified offset.

   Whereas hdfsRead() increments the current offset in the file by the
   number of bytes that are read, hdfsPread() does not change the current
   offset. For example, if the current offset is 0 and hdfsPread() starts
   reading from offset 100, after the read the current offset is still 0.

Signature

tSize  hdfsPread(hdfsFS fs, hdfsFile file, tOffset position, void* buffer, tSize
 length)

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   fs The handle of the filesystem where the file is located. Obtain this
   handle with one of the hdfsConnect() APIs.
   file The file handle. Obtain this handle with one of the hdfsOpenFile()
   APIs.
   position Offset from which to read.
   buffer The buffer to copy read bytes into.
   length The length of the buffer. The maximum size of tSize is the
   maximum buffer length.

Return Value

   Returns the number of bytes actually read, which can be less than than
   the length of the buffer if the end of the file is reached during the
   read. Returns -1 on error.

   On error, errno is set to one of the following values:
     * EACCES if the access permissions are violated.
     * ESTALE if the file doesn't exist on the server.
     * EINVAL if the arguments are invalid or if the file type doesn't
       support read operations.

   To recover from errors, close the file by calling hdfsCloseFile().
