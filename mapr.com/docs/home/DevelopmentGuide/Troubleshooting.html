Troubleshooting

   My application that includes maprfs-0.1.jar is now missing dependencies
          and fails to link.
          As of version 2.1.2 of the MapR distribution, the contents of
          maprfs-0.1.jar are separated into two parts:
          maprfs-<version>.jar and maprfs-jni-<version>.jar. The <version>
          refers to the version of the MapR distribution. For example, if
          you have an existing application written for maprfs-0.1.jar and
          you update it to load maprfs-2.1.2.jar, you must also include
          maprfs-jni-2.1.2.jar. This change was made to enable loading on
          distributed class-loader environments that use the maprfs
          libraries to access MapR file system from multiple contexts.

          These JAR files are installed in the
          /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop<version>/lib/ directory, or can be
          accessed via the Maven Central Repository.
