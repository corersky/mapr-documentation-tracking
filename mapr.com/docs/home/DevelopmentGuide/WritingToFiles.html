Writing to Files

   There are two APIs for writing to files: hdfsWrite() and hdfsPwrite().
   With both APIs, you pass a buffer that contains the data to write. You
   also pass the length of the buffer in bytes. There maximum length of
   the buffer is the maximum size of the datatype that is used to specify
   the buffer length. The datatype is a custom datatype: tSize, a signed
   32-bit integer.

   Both APIs return the number of bytes that were written. Flushes to the
   server happen automatically at intervals during a write operation.
   After a write operation is finished, either call hdfsFlush() explicitly
   or call hdfsFlush() implicitly by calling hdfsCloseFile() to be sure
   that any data remaining in the write buffer is flushed.

   For an example of both APIs in action, see [1]hdfs_write_revised.c.
   Note: The core-site.xml flags:
     * fs.mapr.flush.unaligned default setting (false) enables flushes to
       the server in 8K boundaries. Unaligned flushes can happen only if
       idle flusher (fs.mapr.write.idleflush.timeout) is triggered. If
       this behavior is not desired, set the value for
       fs.mapr.flush.unaligned to true, which will enable flushing of
       unaligned write buffers (so that even small writes can be flushed
       on every subsequent write call).
     * fs.mapr.write.idleflush.timeout automatically flushes the buffer,
       by default, after 3 seconds for all the open files. This can be
       disabled by setting the value to 0. If value is specified, buffer
       is flushed automatically between n to n+1 seconds. For example, if
       value is 3 seconds, the write buffer is not cached after 4 seconds.

Using hdfsWrite()

   When a file is opened in write-only mode or read-write mode, the file
   is truncated from offset 0, effectively deleting the content of the
   file. Therefore, the initial write to the file begins at offset 0. You
   can start subsequent writes anywhere in the file after first calling
   hdfsSeek() to move to the desired offset. After a write operation, the
   offset is located at the last written byte.

   If the file is opened in append mode, data is appended to the end of
   the file only.

   If a call to hdfsSeek() moves the offset past the end of the file
   before a call to hdfsWrite(), the result is a hole in the file between
   the previous end of the file and the offset at which the write begins.

   You can obtain the size of a file in bytes by calling
   hdfsGetPathInfo.()

   On error, pending write buffers are flushed to the server.

Using hdfsPwrite()

   Whereas hdfsWrite() increments the current offset by the amount of
   bytes returned by the API (except in case of error), hdfsPwrite() does
   not change the value of current offset. If the current offset before
   the call to hdfsPwrite() is 0 and you specify the offset 10 for the
   write operation, after the write the current offset remains 0.

   If a call to hdfsPwrite() specifies an offset that is past the end of
   the file, the result is a hole in the file between the previous end of
   the file and the offset at which the write begins.

   You can obtain the size of a file in bytes by calling
   hdfsGetPathInfo().

   On error, pending write buffers are flushed to the server.
