Connect to the Cluster

   Application are often run on nodes that are not part of the MapR
   Cluster. There are many methods to connect to a MapR cluster; this
   section briefly describes each option.

   MapR Client
          The MapR client includes the libraries and utilities required on
          an edge node to perform the following: connect to the cluster,
          submit MapReduce applications, submit YARN applications, run
          hadoop fs commands, and run hadoop mfs commands. However, to run
          applications that access data from MapR-DB or MapR-ES, you must
          configure additional dependencies. For more information about
          the MapR client, see [1]MapR Client and [2]How MapR Client
          Connects to the Cluster.

          Note: Although it is not recommended, you can include the
          MapR-FS JAR file in the application instead of installing the
          MapR client. However, there are caveats and specific
          requirements to make this work. For information, see [3]Using
          the MapR-FS JAR to Connect to the Cluster.

   MapR Persistent Application Client Container (PACC)
          The MapR Persistent Application Client Container (PACC) is a
          Docker-based container image that includes a container-optimized
          MapR client. The PACC provides seamless access to MapR Converged
          Data Platform services, including MapR-FS, MapR-DB, and MapR-ES.
          The PACC includes the POSIX client, the MapR client, and the
          libraries required to build MapR-DB and MapR-ES applications.
          For more information, see [4]About the MapR Persistent
          Application Client Container (PACC).

   MapR POSIX Clients
          MapR POSIX clients enable app servers, web servers, and other
          client nodes and applications to read and write directly and
          securely to the MapR-FS. For more information about the POSIX
          clients, see [5]POSIX Clients and [6]MapR POSIX Clients.

   MapR NFS Clients
          You can mount the cluster itself via NFS so that your
          applications can read and write data directly. For more
          information, see [7]Managing MapR NFS.
