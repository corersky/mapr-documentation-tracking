Installing and Configuring MapR Filesystem C Clients

   Install the mapr-client package on the nodes on which you plan to build
   and run client applications. This package installs the libMapRClient
   library. See [1]Setting Up the Client.
   Note: The package mapr-core contains the files that are in the
   mapr-client package. If you have installed the mapr-core package, you
   do not need to install the mapr-client package.

   The modified versions of libhdfs are installed in this directory:

   MAPR_HOME/hadoop/hadoop-2.x/
