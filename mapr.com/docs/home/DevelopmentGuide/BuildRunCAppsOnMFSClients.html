Compiling and Running C Applications on MapR Filesystem Clients

   MapR Filesystem exposes the HDFS API; if you already have a client
   program built to use libhdfs, you do not have to relink your program
   just to access the MapR file system. However, re-linking to the
   MapR-specific shared library libMapRClient.so will give you better
   performance on MapR file system, because it does not make any Java
   calls to access the filesystem (unlike libhdfs.so).

   The script below sets environment variables to necessary values and
   compiles one of the sample applications. Use this script as an example
   for building and launching your own applications.

   When you set HADOOP_HOME for your own client applications, set it to
   the path for the version of libhdfs that your application uses. The
   path is:

   MAPR_HOME/hadoop/hadoop-2.x/

   Also, set the path to your application in the gcc command, of course.

   This script assumes that MAPR_HOME is set to the default value of
   /opt/mapr.
#!/bin/bash
#Setup environment
export HADOOP_HOME=${MAPR_HOME}/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${MAPR_HOME}/lib/native/
export LD_RUN_PATH=${LD_RUN_PATH}:${MAPR_HOME}/lib
GCC_OPTS="-Wl,--allow-shlib-undefined -I. -I{$HADOOP_HOME}/include/"

#Compile and Link
gcc ${GCC_OPTS} ${HADOOP_HOME}src/c++/libhdfs/hdfs_read.c -o hdfs_read -L${MAPR_
HOME}/lib -lMapRClient

#Launch the application
./hdfs_read

   Note:
     * The compiled libMapRClient is statically linked to the following
       third-party libraries:
          + Crypto++: libcryptoapp.a (v5.6.2)
          + Protobuf: libprotobuf-lite.a (v2.5.0)
     * If a client application connects to the local fileserver, before
       launching the application you can set the MAPR_CLIENT_SHMEM
       environment variable to control how much of the local system's
       memory should be devoted to the resources and buffers used for
       communication between the client application and the local
       fileserver. By default, the size of the shared memory is 20 MB. If
       you want to change this value, specify it as a number of pages. For
       example, to set the shared memory at 128 MB, multiply 128 by 10242
       bytes and then divide the product by 8192 bytes. In this case, the
       value would be 16384 pages.
