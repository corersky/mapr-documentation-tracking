Loading the MapR Native Library

   By default, the root class loader will load the MapR native library to
   allow all children to see and access the MapR native library. If the
   MapR native library is loaded by a child class, other classes will not
   be able to access the library. To allow applications and associated
   child classes to access the symbols and variables in the MapR native
   library, we recommend loading the MapR native library via the root
   loader.

   The loading of the MapR native library via the root class loader is
   accomplished by injecting code into the root loader. If MapR runs on
   top of applications (such as Tomcat) where it does not have access to
   the root class loader, the MapR native library will not be loaded.
   Child classes that try to access the symbols under the assumption that
   the root class loader successfully loaded the MapR native library will
   fail.

   The parameter -Dmapr.library.flatclass, when specified with Java,
   disables the injection of code via the root class loader, thus
   disabling the loading of the MapR native library using the root class
   loader. Instead, the application trying to access the symbols can load
   the MapR native library themselves. However, since the MapR native
   library can be loaded only once and can only be seen by the application
   loading it, ensure that only one application within the JVM attempts to
   load and access the MapR native library.
