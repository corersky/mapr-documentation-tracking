hdfsOpenFile2()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Opens a file in a given mode. Creates the file if the file does not
   exist.

   If hdfsOpenFile2() creates a file, it stores the size of the name
   container in a location that you pass a pointer into, so that you can
   keep track of this size. The size is in bytes.

   Keeping track of the size of the name container is useful when you are
   creating files that are less than or equal to 64 KB. When the size of
   all of the such files together for one name container exceeds 64 GB,
   operations on the name container can become inefficient. If the size of
   a name container reaches 64 GB, you can switch to a new or different
   volume.

   Before the call to hdfsOpenFile2(), hdfsExists() can check that the
   file exists, if a check is needed.

   After finishing work on a file, call hdfsCloseFile() to free the
   resources that are associated with the file.

Signature

hdfsFile hdfsOpenFile2(hdfsFS fs, const char* path, int flags, int bufferSize, s
hort replication, tSize blocksize, tSize *nameSizeInBytes)

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   fs The handle of the filesystem where the file is located. Obtain this
   handle with one of the hdfsConnect() APIs.
   path The full path to the file.
   flags One of the following values. These flags are included in the
   fcntl.h header file.

   O_RDONLY
          Opens the file in read-only mode with the current offset at 0.

   O_RDWR
          Opens the file in read-write mode. If the file already exists,
          it is truncated to offset 0, effectively deleting the content of
          the file.

   O_RDWR | O_APPEND
          Opens the file in read-write mode with the current offset at 0.
          Writing to the file with hdfsWrite() appends the written data to
          the end of the file. Data written with hdfsPwrite() is not
          appended, but written starting at the offset specified in the
          call to that API.

   O_WRONLY
          Opens the file in write-only mode. If the file already exists,
          it is truncated to offset 0, effectively deleting the content of
          the file.

   O_WRONLY | O_APPEND
          Opens the file in write-only mode with the current offset at 0.
          Writing to the file with hdfsWrite() appends the written data to
          the end of the file. Data written with hdfsPwrite() is not
          appended, but written starting at the offset specified in the
          call to that API.

   bufferSize Ignored for files on MapR-FS
   replication Ignored for files on MapR-FS
   blocksize The size of chunks for the file in bytes. Use 0 if you want
   to use the value that is specified for the fs.mapr.block.size parameter
   in the /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml file on the
   client (if the client is using the libMapRClient version of
   hadoop-2.x). If this parameter is not set in core-site.xml, the default
   value is taken from the directoryâ€™s .dfs_attrributes file.
   nameSizeInBytes A pointer to a memory buffer that can store the size in
   bytes of the name container. The value is returned only if
   hdfsOpenFile2() creates the specified file because the file does not
   already exist.

Return Value

   Returns the handle to the open file or NULL on error.

   Check errno for error codes and meanings.
