Using the MapR-FS JAR to Connect to the Cluster

   The MapR-FS JAR file includes the MapR client libraries required to
   connect to the cluster. While this is strongly discouraged, application
   developers can bundle the MapR-FS JAR file in MapR-FS, MapR-DB, and
   MapR-ES applications instead of installing the MapR client on the edge
   node (node that runs the application). Applications should not bundle
   the MapR-FS JAR file unless the application meets certain requirements.
   Important: When bundling the MapR-FS JAR file, if there is a binary
   mismatch between the bundled JAR file and the version that the cluster
   expects, this can result in failures. In MapR 5.2.2 and later, the
   system detects the mismatch and prevents the application from starting.
   In MapR releases earlier than 5.2.2, nodes running applications may run
   out of memory or shut down unexpectedly.

Requirements

   You can bundle the MapR-FS JAR (maprfs-<version>-mapr.jar) with
   applications that meet all of the following requirements:
     * The application communicates directly with the MapR-FS, MapR-DB, or
       MapR-Streams.
     * The application does not run as a MapReduce or YARN job/application
       on the cluster.
     * The application does not include MapR-FS JARs on the local machine
       in its classpath.
     * The application accesses a cluster that is not secure.

Configuring the Cluster Connection

   When you include the MapR-FS JAR in an application instead of
   installing the MapR Client on the edge node, you must create and
   configure a mapr-clusters.conf file on node that runs the application.
    1. Set a MAPR_HOME environment variable to a location such as
       /opt/mapr.
    2. Create the mapr-clusters.conf file in the $MAPR_HOME/conf
       directory.
    3. Configure the mapr-clusters.conf file with the cluster name and the
       list of CLDB nodes.
       For example, the mapr-clusters.conf on an edge node would contain
       the following content if it was connecting to a cluster named
       my.cluster with CLDB nodes on centos765, centos234, and centos123:
my.cluster secure=false centos765 centos234 centos123
       For more information about how to configure mapr-clusters.conf, see
       [1]mapr-clusters.conf.

   cluster, see [2]How MapR Client Connects to the Cluster.

Using Maven to Include MapR-FS JAR as a Dependency

   If you use Maven to bundle the MapR-FS JAR file with an application and
   you plan to run the application on a MapR cluster where a patch has
   been applied, ensure that you specify both a system scope and a local
   system path to the file.
   For example, to bundle the MapR-FS 5.2 JAR file, the pom.xml file may
   include the following:
...
 <groupId>com.mapr.hadoop</groupId>
        <artifactId>maprfs</artifactId>
        <version>${mapr.core.version}</version>
        <scope>system</scope>
        <systemPath>/opt/mapr/lib/maprfs-5.2.0-mapr.jar</systemPath>
...

   By default, the MapR Maven repository includes JAR files from
   [3]http://repository.mapr.com/maven/. This default Maven repository
   includes JAR files associated with the GA packages for each MapR
   release. Therefore, when a patch has been applied to the cluster,
   failure to specify a system scope may result in errors due to a binary
   mismatch between the MapR-FS JAR files used by the application and the
   cluster.

Known Issues

   Nodes running applications with a bundled MapR-FS JAR file may run out
   of memory or shut down unexpectedly in the following scenarios:

   The version of the MapR-FS JAR included in the application differs from
          the version that is available on the cluster.
          This may occur when a patch was applied to some, but not all the
          nodes in the cluster. It can also occur when Maven is bundling
          the GA version of the JAR file when the cluster expects a newer,
          patched version.

   Two versions of the JAR are available on the node.
          For YARN applications, the NodeManager nodes that run the tasks
          or containers store local versions of the dependencies included
          with the application. In this scenario, since both the clusterâ€™s
          MapR-FS JAR and the version included in the application are
          available on the node, it is unknown which JAR will be used when
          processing the application.
