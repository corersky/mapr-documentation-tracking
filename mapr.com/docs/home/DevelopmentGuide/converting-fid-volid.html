Converting fid and volid

   The following MapR-FS APIs are available in com.mapr.fs.MapRFileSystem
   for converting fid to file path and volid to volume name:
     * public String getMountPathFidCached(String fidStr) throws
       IOException
     * public String getVolumeNameCached(int volId) throws IOException
     * public String getVolumeName(int volId) throws IOException
     * public String getMountPathFid(String fidStr) throws IOException

Converting fid to File Path

   The getMountPathFid(string) and getMountPathFidCached(string) APIs can
   be used for converting file ID to the full path to the file. The
   getMountPathFid() API makes a call to CLDB and MFS to get the file path
   from the fid. Because this API does not cache or store this information
   locally, it might make repeated requests to CLDB and MFS for the same
   fid and this might result in many RPCs to both CLDB and MFS. The
   getMountPathFidCached() API makes a call the CLDB and MFS one time and
   stores the information locally in the shared library of the client. For
   subsequent calls, it uses the locally stored information to retrieve
   the file path from the fid. However, if there are many files in the
   volume, there might still be a large number of calls to CLDB and MFS to
   determine the file path for each fid in the volume. The caching is
   useful if the API attempts to determine the file path for the same fid
   repeatedly. The cache is purged after 15 seconds. If the file name
   changes before the cache is purged, you will see the old name for the
   file until the cache expires. You can use these APIs to convert the fid
   to the file path.

   For example, the [1]sample consumer application and the sample
   [2]uncached consumer application for consuming audit logs as stream
   messages use these methods as shown below.

   Sample Cached Cosumer

{
     String token = st1.nextToken();
     /* If the field has fid, expand it using Cached API */
     if (token.endsWith("Fid")) {
       String lfidStr = st1.nextToken();
       String path= null;
       try {
           path = fs.getMountPathFidCached(lfidStr); // Expand FID to path
       } catch (IOException e){
     }
     lfidPath = "\"FidPath\":\""+path+"\",";
     // System.out.println("\nPAth for fid " + lfidStr +  "is " +  path);
}

   Sample Uncached Consumer

{
     String token = st1.nextToken();
     if (token.endsWith("Fid")) {
         String lfidStr = st1.nextToken();
         String path= null;
         try {
           path = fs.getMountPathFid(lfidStr);// Expand FID to path
         } catch (IOException e){
         }
     lfidPath = "\"FidPath\":\""+path+"\",";
     // System.out.println("\nPAth for fid " + lfidStr +  "is " +  path);
}

Converting volid to Volume Name

   The getVolumeName() and getVolumeNameCached() APIs can be used for
   converting volume IDs to volume name. The getVolumeName() API makes a
   call to the CLDB every time to get the volume name from the volid and
   this may result in too many RPCs to CLDB. The getVolumeNameCached() API
   makes a call the CLDB one time and stores the information locally in
   the shared library of the client. For subsequent calls, it uses the
   locally stored information to retrieve the volume name from the volid.
   The cache is purged after 15 seconds. You can use these APIs to convert
   the volid to volume name.

   For example, the [3]sample consumer application and the sample
   [4]uncached consumer application for consuming audit logs as stream
   messages uses these methods as shown below.

   Sample Cached Consumer

if (token.endsWith("volumeId")) {
       String volid = st1.nextToken();
       String name= null;
       try {
         int volumeId = Integer.parseInt(volid);
           // Cached API to convert volume Id to volume Name
           name = fs.getVolumeNameCached(volumeId);
         }
       catch (IOException e){
       }
       lvolName = "\"VolumeName\":\""+name+"\",";
       //  System.out.println("\nVolume Name for volid " + volid +  "is " +  nam
e);
}

   Sample Uncached Consumer

if (token.endsWith("volumeId")) {
       String volid = st1.nextToken();
       String name= null;
       try {
         int volumeId = Integer.parseInt(volid);
           // API to convert volume Id to volume Name
           name = fs.getVolumeName(volumeId);
         }
       catch (IOException e){
       }
       lvolName = "\"VolumeName\":\""+name+"\",";
       //  System.out.println("\nVolume Name for volid " + volid +  "is " +  nam
e);
}
