YARN Application Requirements

   The following tables include the minimal node requirements for building
   and running YARN applications.

   CAPTION:

   Node Requirement Method(s) to Meet Requirement
   A connection to the MapR cluster.
   Select one of the following options:
     * Install and configure the MapR client.
     * Install the PACC and run an application container.

   For more information, see [1]Connect to the Cluster.
   Hadoop libraries are configured as an application dependency.

   When you compile the application, use the Maven Repository to determine
   the dependencies. The POM file should include the MapR Repository and
   the hadoop-common dependency:
<repositories>
   <repository> <id>mapr-releases</id>   <url>http://repository.mapr.com/maven/<
/url>  <snapshots><enabled>false</enabled></snapshots>      <releases><enabled>t
rue</enabled></releases>
      </repository>
   </repositories>

<dependencies>
 <dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
   <artifactId>hadoop-common</artifactId>
  <version>${hadoop.version}</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>

   When you run the application, include the following in the
   applicationâ€™s classpath: `hadoop classpath`

   Note: Based on how you submit the application, the classpath locations
   and requirements differ. See [2]External Applications and Classpath and
   [3]Classpath Construction.

   Other Items
     * If an ecosystem component, such as Spark, runs or integrates with
       the application, you may need to include additional dependencies in
       the POM file.
     * Any third-party library that is required by a MapReduce program
       must be accessible to this node and the data node that processes
       the job or application. For more information, see [4]Managing
       Third-Party Libraries.
