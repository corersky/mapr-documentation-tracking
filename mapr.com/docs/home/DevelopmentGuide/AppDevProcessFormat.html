Step 1: Select a Data Storage Format

   Consider the data format options and determine how you want to use to
   store your data.

   Keep in mind that a single application can access data from a variety
   of data formats. The following data formats are available.

MapR Filesystem

   MapR Filesystem is a random read-write distributed file system that
   allows applications to concurrently read and write directly to files.
   This data store is great for storing and scanning large data sets of
   historical data, and for sharing files between various services and
   applications. Any node with access to the MapR file system can access
   files on the file system.
   Consider the following examples:
     * Write large amounts of user click-stream data for a web site in a
       simple directory structure based on the date, and then process that
       data using tools like Spark, Drill, Hive or another MapReduce
       application.
     * Store various types of images, audio files, and video files in one
       shared directory so that web or mobile applications can render the
       content as required.
     * Share configuration files or internationalized resources among
       various applications by storing these files in a shared directory.
     * Simplify the deployment of new applications by adding java
       libraries (.jar files) to a shared directory and then including the
       directory in the classpath of one or more applications.
     * Store the Docker files and images in a shared location which can be
       accessed by various servers. This provides a single, shared
       location from which users can launch containers.

   When you store large data sets, use a file format in which the data can
   be consumed efficiently. For example, Parquet, ORC, sequence files are
   good for storing and scanning. Parquet, in particular, is great for
   storing data on the MapR file system as it stores data in columnar
   format which can be partitioned. Parquet also works well for use cases
   where you query the data with Drill or process the data with Spark
   applications. Note that you can use CSV or JSON formats, but they are
   less efficient when your intention is to scan the data.

MapR Database

   MapR Database is an enterprise-grade, high performance, NoSQL database
   management system that supports both binary and JSON tables. Consider
   using MapR Database tables when you want to query and organize large
   amounts data. It also integrates with Drill, Apache Spark, Hive and
   other MapReduce tools to provide applications the ability to scan or
   query large data sets in an efficient, distributed way.
   MapR Database provides the following features:
     * A flexible schema. Each row or document can have its own set of
       attributes.
     * Efficient random access. Applications can quickly access one or
       more records using a row key, document ID, or a conditional
       queries.
     * Easy and efficient data mutation. Applications can insert, update,
       and delete rows or documents.

   MapR Database Binary Tables
          MapR Database binary tables consist of rows that are identified
          by primary keys and row data is identified by key/value pairs.
          MapR Database tables are similar to HBase tables in that MapR
          Database does not determine or store the datatype of each value
          in the table. But, MapR Database tables perform operations more
          efficiently than HBase table. You might want to use binary
          tables when you want to create or use an existing HBase
          application. However, on the Converged Data Platform, JSON
          tables are usually preferred due to their flexibility.

   MapR Database JSON Tables
          A MapR Database JSON tables provide a flexible, powerful schema
          that you can customize based on the data that you want to
          represent. Each row in a JSON table corresponds to an JSON
          document with an unique _id and each JSON document can have a
          different set of columns. MapR Database JSON tables determine
          the datatype of each value based on the type of data written to
          the document.
          The following example lists three JSON documents from a single
          JSON table. Note that the attributes associated with each
          document varies.

MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka

   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka is a publish/subscribe messaging
   solution that uses the Apache Kafka API. MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka writes events as messages in a topic and topics are part of a
   stream. Producer applications can publish events to a stream and
   consumer applications can read all or a subset of the messages in a
   stream. By default, messages are stored into a topic for 7 days and
   after that point they are automatically purged by MapR. However, you
   can shorten or extend the time-to-live (ttl) for messages in a stream
   based on your use case.
