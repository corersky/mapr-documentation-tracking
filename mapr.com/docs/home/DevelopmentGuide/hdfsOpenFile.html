hdfsOpenFile()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Opens a file in the specified mode. Creates the file and intermediate
   directories if they do not exist.

   Requires a valid filesystem handle, which one of the hdfsConnect() APIs
   can provide.

   Before the call to hdfsOpenFile(), hdfsExists() can check that the file
   exists, if a check is needed.

   After finishing work on a file, call hdfsCloseFile() to free the memory
   that is associated with the file.

Signature

hdfsFile hdfsOpenFile(hdfsFS fs, const char* path, int flags, int bufferSize, sh
ort replication, tSize blocksize)

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   fs The handle of the filesystem where the file is located. Obtain this
   handle with one of the hdfsConnect() APIs.
   path The full path to the file.
   flags One of the following values. These flags are included in the
   fcntl.h header file.

   O_RDONLY
          Opens the file in read-only mode with the current offset at 0.

   O_RDWR
          Opens the file in read-write mode. If the file already exists,
          it is truncated to offset 0, effectively deleting the content of
          the file to offset 0.

   O_RDWR | O_APPEND
          Opens the file in read-write mode with the current offset at 0.
          Writing to the file with hdfsWrite() appends the written data to
          the end of the file. Data written with hdfsPwrite() is not
          appended, but written starting at the offset specified in the
          call to that API.

   O_WRONLY
          Opens the file in write-only mode. If the file already exists,
          it is truncated to offset 0, effectively deleting the content of
          the file.

   O_WRONLY | O_APPEND
          Opens the file in write-only mode with the current offset at 0.
          Writing to the file with hdfsWrite() appends the written data to
          the end of the file. Data written with hdfsPwrite() is not
          appended, but written starting at the offset specified in the
          call to that API.

   bufferSize Ignored for files on MapR file system
   replication Ignored for files on MapR file system
   blocksize The size of chunks for the file in bytes. Specify 0 if you
   want to use the value that is specified for the fs.mapr.block.size
   parameter in the /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml
   file on the client (if the client is using the libMapRClient version of
   hadoop-2.x). If this parameter is not set in core-site.xml, the default
   value is taken from the directoryâ€™s .dfs_attrributes file.

Return Value

   Returns the handle to the open file or NULL on error.

   Check errno for error codes and meanings.
