hdfsConnectAsUser()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Connects to a MapR Filesystem cluster as specified user.

   If a connection to the cluster in which the remote host is located
   already exists, the functions return a handle to this existing
   connection.

   If a connection to the cluster does not already exist, the functions
   return a unique handle to a connection instance for each user.
   Note: If default is used for the host parameter, this means connect to
   the first cluster listed in the MAPR_HOME/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file
   on the client.

   For more information about connections, see [1]Establishing Connections
   to MapR Filesystem.
