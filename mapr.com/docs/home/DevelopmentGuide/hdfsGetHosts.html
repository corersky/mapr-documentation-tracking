hdfsGetHosts()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Gets hostnames where a particular block, as determined by the offset
   and block size, is stored. Due to replication, a single block could be
   present on multiple hosts.

   This function can be useful for understanding the performance
   implications of file access, and to validate or verify changes to the
   replication factor.

Signature

char*** hdfsGetHosts(hdfsFS fs, const char* path, tOffset start, tOffset length)

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description

   length The length of the block.

Return Value

   If successful, returns a dynamically-allocated two-dimensional array of
   hostnames. The last element in the array is NULL.

   Returns NULL on error.
