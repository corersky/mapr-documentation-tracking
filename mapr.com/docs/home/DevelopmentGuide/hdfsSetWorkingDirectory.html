hdfsSetWorkingDirectory()

   Supported by libMapRClient for hadoop-2.x

   Set the working directory. All relative paths will be resolved relative
   to it.

   For example, if you call this API to set the working directory to
   /mycluster/myvolume and subsequently call hdfsOpenFile() with the path
   /temp/tmp.txt, the full path to the file to open is assumed to be
   /mycluster/myvolume/temp/tmp.txt.

Signature

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   fs The handle of the filesystem where the directory is located. Obtain
   this handle with one of the hdfsConnect() APIs.
   path The path of the new working directory.

Return Value

   Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.

   Check errno for error codes and meanings.

   errno is set to EINVAL for invalid arguments.
