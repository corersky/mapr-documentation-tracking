Configure a Secure MapR Filesystem Sink

   When writing to the MapR file system on a secure cluster, you must
   configure Flume agents to use either a MapR user ticket or a Kerberos
   ticket.

   Secure MapR cluster may use either MapR-SASL or Kerberos to provide
   authentication. Therefore, the user that launches the flume-ng JVM
   agent on a secure cluster can authenticate with the MapR file system
   using a MapR user ticket or a Kerberos ticket. When you authenticate
   with Kerberos, the user does not need to run the maprlogin utility to
   authenticate with the cluster as long a a valid kerberos ticket is
   present. When you authenticate with a mapr user ticket, you must run
   the maprlogin utility to generate a maprticket before you launch the
   flume-ng JVM agent.

Configure Flume agents to use MapR user tickets when writing to MapR file
system

   If you use MapR-SASL (MapR user ticket) to authenticate, configure a
   dummy value for the Kerberos principal and keytab file in the
   flume.conf. Example:
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.kerberosPrincipal = mapr
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.kerberosKeytab = /opt/mapr/conf/cldb.conf

   These dummy Kerberos principal and keytab files are not used with the
   HDFSSink operations. However, when the dummy Kerberos properties are
   not configured, Flume agent error logs display the following error
   messages:
Dec 2013 13:01:42,448 ERROR [conf-file-poller-0]
        (org.apache.flume.sink.hdfs.HDFSEventSink.authenticate:510)  - Hadoop ru
nning in secure
        mode, but Flume config doesn't specify a principal to use for Kerberos a
uth.
10 Dec 2013 13:01:42,448 ERROR [conf-file-poller-0]
        (org.apache.flume.sink.hdfs.HDFSEventSink.configure:241)  - Failed to au
thenticate!

   These errors relate to Kerberos authentication prerequisite failures
   and can be ignored when you are not using Kerberos. Secure Flume
   operations with maprlogin-mediated tickets continue to be available.

Configure Flume agents to use a Kerberos ticket when writing to MapR file
system

    1. Create a keytab file called flume.keytab which contains a principal
       that matches the Kerberos identity of the user that will be running
       flume-ng. Example:
# kadmin
: addprinc -randkey username/<FQDN@REALM>
: ktadd -k /opt/mapr/conf/flume.keytab username/<FQDN@REALM>
       The flume.keytab file must be owned and readable only by the mapr
       user.
    2. In the flume.conf file, configure the following properties:

   CAPTION:

   Property Value Comment
   <agent>.sinks.<sink>.type HDFS
   <agent>.sinks.<sink>.hdfs.proxyUser weblogs
   <agent>.sinks.<sink>.hdfs.kerberosPrincipal username/FQDN@REALM.COM The
   user component of the principal must be the username of the user
   running flume-ng.
   <agent>.sinks.<sink>.hdfs.kerberosKeytab path to file Provide the path
   to your flume.keytab file.

   Note: Flume does not support any authentication mechanism for an Avro
   client.

   For additional properties that you may want to configure, see the[1]
   Apache Flume documentation.
