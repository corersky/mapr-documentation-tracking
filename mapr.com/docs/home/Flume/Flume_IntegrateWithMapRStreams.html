Integrate Flume with MapR-ES

   Integrate Flume 1.6 with MapR-ES when you want to write Flume source
   data to a MapR-ES topic or when you want to write MapR-ES topics to a
   Flume sink.
   You can use Flume and MapR-ES for many different use cases; however,
   here are a few examples:

   Write MapR-ES topics to file on the MapR-FS
          To write MapR-ES topics to the MapR-FS, create an agent with a
          Kafka source and a HDFS sinks.

   Write MapR-ES topics to MapR-DB
          To write MapR-ES topics to MapR-DB, create an agent with a Kafka
          source and a MapR-DB sink.

   Write data from any supported Flume source to MapR-ES topics
          To write data from any supported Flume source to MapR-ES topics,
          create an agent with the appropriate Flume source type and a
          Kafka sink or Kafka channel. For example, you can use a syslogs
          source to turn logs into a MapR stream topic.

   Note: Before you integrate Flume with MapR-ES, verify that the Streams
   Client is installed on all Flume nodes. For more information, see
   [1]Installing Flume.
