Configure a Secure HBase Sink

   Configure Flume agents to use Kerberos when you want to write sinks to
   secure HBase.
    1. Create a keytab file called flume.keytab which contains a principal
       that matches the Kerberos identity of the user that will be running
       flume-ng. For example:
# kadmin
: addprinc -randkey username/<FQDN@REALM>
: ktadd -k /opt/mapr/conf/flume.keytab username/<FQDN@REALM>
       The flume.keytab file must be owned and readable only by the mapr
       user.
    2. In the flume.conf file, configure the following properties:

   Property Value Description
   <agent>.sinks.<hbaseSink>.kerberosPrincipal username/FQDN@REALM.COM The
   Kerberos identity of the user running flume-ng.
   <agent>.sinks.<hbaseSink>.kerberosKeytab path_to_keytab The path to a
   valid keytab file (flume.keytab) for the user running flume-ng

   For additional properties that you may want to configure, see the[1]
   Apache Flume documentation.
   Note: Once Kerberos is enabled, the maprlogin ticket generation is
   performed implicitly.
