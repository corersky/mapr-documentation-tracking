Read MapR-ES Using a Kafka Source

   The following parameters are required when configuring Kafka source to
   read data from MapR Streams topics:
   Property Name Description
   channels If the source writes events to a channel, this is the name of
   the channel that the source writes events to.
   type This property must be set to
org.apache.flume.source.kafka.KafkaSource

   kafka.consumer.group.id A unique identifier of the consumer group. This
   defaults to flume. Setting the same id in multiple sources or agents
   indicates that they are part of the same consumer group; when these
   sources or agents are running at the same time, they will each read a
   unique set of partitions for the topics in the group.
   kafka.topics A comma separated list of MapR-ES topics where each topic
   is specified with the volume path and stream name. For example:
/volume_path/stream_name:topic_name1,
/volume_path/stream_name:topic_name2

   Note: It is critical that the path to the topic starts with a slash(/),
   as the slash is what distinguishes the topic as a MapR-ES topic.
   batchDurationMillis Maximum number of milliseconds to wait before
   closing a batch. The default value is 1000.

   For additional properties that you may want to configure, see the
   [1]Flume documentation. However, note that kafka.bootstrap.servers is
   not required for reading MapR-ES.

   Tip: To increase throughput, set the batchSize to a higher value. The
   batchSize is the maximum number of messages written to Channel in one
   batch. By default, it is set to 1000.
