Write to MapR-ES using a Kafka Sink

   The following parameters are required when configuring Kafka sink to
   write to a MapR Stream:
   Property Name Description
   type This property must be set to
org.apache.flume.sink.kafka.KafkaSink

   kafka.topic A topic specified with the volume path and stream name. For
   example:
/streaming_data/flume_stream:topic1

   Note: It is critical that the path to the topic starts with a slash(/),
   as the slash is what distinguishes the topic as a MapR-ES topic. The
   default is "default-flume-topic".
   Note: If the header for a given message contains a "topic" field, the
   message will be published to that topic instead of the topic that you
   configure here.
   For additional properties that you may want to configure for the Kafka
   sink, see the [1]Flume documentation.
   Note: kafka.flumeBatchSize sets the number of messages to process in a
   batch and the default is 100. To ensure that the events are written in
   the original order, set kafka.flumeBatchSize=1 and specify a topic with
   a single partition. If maintaining the order is not required, you can
   increase the value. However, note that larger batches improve
   throughput while also adding latency.
