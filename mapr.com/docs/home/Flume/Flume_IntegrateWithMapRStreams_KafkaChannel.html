Read or Write to MapR-ES using a Kafka Channel

   Using a Kafka channel without a Flume sink or Flume source is more
   reliable; it also involves less code. A Kafka channel is also useful
   when you want to use one agent to store messages in a topic and then
   copy the messages to another type of sink.
   Note: Do not use a Kafka Channel when you have the following
   requirements:
     * Maintain of the order of each event.
     * Read or write data from more than one topic.
     * Good performance. Writing messages to a topic with a Kafka sink can
       be twice as fast as a Kafka channel.

   The following parameters are required when configuring Kafka channel to
   read or write data in MapR-ES:
   Property Name Description
   type This property must be set to
org.apache.flume.channel.kafka.KafkaChannel

   kafka.topic A topic is specified with the volume path and stream name.
   For example:
/volume_path/stream_name:topic_name1

   Note: It is critical that the path to the topic starts with a slash
   (/), as the slash is what distinguishes the topic as a MapR-ES topic as
   opposed to a Kafka topic.
   kafka.pollTimeout The maximum amount of time in milliseconds the
   channel will wait for events if they are not available. The default is
   500.
   parseAsFlumeEvent This must be set to false if other channels or sinks
   write to the same topic.
   producer.linger.ms These properties are used to configure the Kafka
   Producer. Any producer property supported by Kafka can be used. The
   only requirement is to prepend the property name with the prefix
   kafka.producer. For example:
kafka.producer.linger.ms=0

   capacity The maximum number of events stored in the channel. The
   default value is 100.
   transactionCapacity The maximum number of events the channel will take
   from a source or give to a sink per transaction. The default value is
   100.

   For additional properties that you may want to configure for the Kafka
   channel, see the [1]Flume documentation. Note that brokerList is not
   required when writing to MapR-ES.
