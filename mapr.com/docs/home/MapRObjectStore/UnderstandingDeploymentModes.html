Understanding MapR Object Store Standalone Deployment Mode

   Because each MapR Object Store interacts only with one bucket or set of
   buckets at a time, you can use only Amazon S3 standalone deployment
   mode.

   You cannot have more than one server instance working against a bucket
   because each MapR Object Store exclusively handles one or more buckets
   at a time.

   To use the S3 API in standalone mode, each MapR Object Store must have
   its own backend directory in MapR File System. You can map it to either
   a volume mount point or a directory path.

   Each S3 gateway serves an exclusive set of buckets. If a bucket does
   not exist, then an application can create a bucket through any of the
   S3 gateways, but it will subsequently only be served through that
   gateway.

   An S3 instance exclusively uses the allocated directory or volume in
   MapR File System. In case you need to migrate buckets to another S3
   instance, move or copy the buckets to another directory or volume.

   The following deployment scenario shows one MapR Object Store per
   cluster that supports multiple applications and multiple buckets with
   bucket sharing supported.

   The following deployment scenario shows two MapR Object Stores for the
   cluster that supports multiple applications and multiple buckets with
   bucket sharing supported. In this case, bucket sharing across S3
   instances are not supported.

   Note: If you want to access multiple buckets without the application
   having to know about bucket locations beforehand, you can deploy a
   single MapR Object Store to serve all requests without the need to
   partition any buckets.
