MapR Object Store with S3-Compatible API

   Starting with MapR Ecosystem Pack (MEP) 6.0.0, MapR Object Store with
   S3-Compatible API (MapR Object Store) is included in MEP repositories.
   To fully benefit from the MapR Object Store, it is important to
   understand what the MapR Object Store is and how it works, how to
   authenticate it and perform bucket operations.

Understanding MapR Object Store

   MapR Object Store has two basic constructions: data objects and
   buckets. A data object can be of any data type, but you must be sure to
   give it a unique name as part of the S3-compatible API call. The data
   objects are grouped into a logical container called a bucket.

   MapR Object Store offers a REST interface compatible with the Amazon S3
   API standard to store and retrieve data from the MapR platform object
   store in the form of files.

   You can use the S3 API to create, list, or delete a bucket and to get,
   put, list, or delete a data object within the bucket.

Difference Between MapR Object Store and Object Tiering

   MapR Object Store is different from the Object Tiering feature. MapR
   Object Store manages all inbound S3 requests to store or retrieve data
   from your clusters. MapR Object Store also supports object notification
   by sending notifications to MapR Streams.

   Object tiering feature leverages its own outbound version of the S3 API
   to directly store archived data in the cloud. For more information on
   object tiering, see [1]Data Tiering.
