Authenticating the MapR Object Store

   You need to authenticate the MapR Object Store.

   As defined in the [1]Amazon S3 documentation, the S3 REST API uses a
   “key” and “secret” in a REST-like manner as credentials to authenticate
   to the underlying object store for authorization purposes when
   accessing data.

   In the S3 world, "credentials" represent the application and not the
   identity of the end user. The application layer is responsible for
   end-user verification.

   The S3 administrator is responsible to assign S3 credentials for the
   application or set of applications and optionally to map those S3
   credentials to a MapR identity.

   The MapR Object Store supports a multitenant scenario in which the S3
   administrator can configure one or more credentials with the
   appropriate MapR-credential mapping.
   The S3 administrator can assign credentials to a user and optionally
   map them to a MapR identity.
   The tenants.json file describes the tenants configuration. This file
   consists of a JSON object with two keys: credentials and tenants. The
   credentials key contains an array of objects with the following fields:
     * accessKey - S3 format access key
     * secretKey - S3 format secret key
     * Tenant - Internal tenant name, used to link an access key to an
       operating systems user
       The tenants key contains an array of objects with the following
       fields:
          + uid - Operating systems user ID for file impersonation
          + gid - Operating systems group ID for file impersonation
          + name - Internal tenant name, used to link an access key to an
            operating systems user

   The credentials block relates more to MapR Object Store authorization,
   whereas the tenants block relates to the users in the system.
