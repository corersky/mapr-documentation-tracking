Understanding MapR Object Store Bucket Policy

   Because the Amazon S3 API standard supports the concept of bucket
   policies to allow the owner of a bucket to grant access for other users
   to share the bucket, you can create buckets using the S3 interface and
   thereby become their owner.

   As owner, you have full access to perform any operation on the bucket
   and on data objects within the bucket, and you can grant other users
   access to your bucket using the S3 Policies API.
