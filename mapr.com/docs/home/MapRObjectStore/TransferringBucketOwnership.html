Transferring Bucket Ownership

   You can transfer bucket ownership from one tenant to another.

Example Scenario

   To transfer ownership of bucket X from tenant A to tenant B, perform
   the following steps:
    1. Tenant B must create an empty bucket X and grant PutObject
       permission to tenant A on this bucket.
    2. Tenant A must copy data, using GetObject and PutObject, from its
       own bucket X to Bâ€™s bucket X.
    3. Tenant A (optionally) deletes its own bucket X.
    4. Tenant B must withdraw permissions on bucket X, which was
       previously given to tenant A.
