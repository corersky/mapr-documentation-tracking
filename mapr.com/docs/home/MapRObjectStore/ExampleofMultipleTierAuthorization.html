Example of Multiple Tier Authorization

   On the file system side, files can be protected either by using MapR
   Access Control Expressions (ACEs) that allow you to grant
   read/write/execute permissions for files or directories to a specific
   user or by using the mixed mode.

   On the S3 side, the owner of the bucket can leverage bucket policies to
   grant access to other users.

   Example Scenario

   Tenant A creates bucket B1. The default bucket policy of
   read/write/execute access to the owner and no access to other tenants
   is applied to the bucket. This can be represented through UNIX
   permissions as 0700.
   Tenant A calls the REST API for bucket policy resulting in the
   following policy to the B1:
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Id": "ExamplePolicy01",
"Statement": [
   {
     "Sid": "ExampleStatement01",
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Principal": {
           “AWS”: “B”
        },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::B1/*",
      ]
    }
  ]
}

   This policy is processed by the MapR Object Store allowing tenant B
   access and it assumes that the ACE is set up for the objects, as
   -readdir u:B | u:A ACE is applied to the bucket directory and -readfile
   u:B | u:A ACE to all existing files. In the mixed mode, tenant B would
   have access.
