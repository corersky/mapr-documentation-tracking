Understanding the MapR Object Store Authorization Model

   The MapR Object Store provides a two-tier authorization model.

   Authorization checking first occurs at the S3 REST API level via the S3
   Bucket Policies check followed by MapR platform file permission layer.

   When a MapR Object Store receives a request from a tenant to access
   another bucket or object, it first checks for bucket policies that
   reference that particular tenant. If the tenant does not have access
   via the bucket policy, then the request is fails and no further
   checking is performed.

   If the tenant does have access via the bucket policy, then the MapR
   File System performs the next check using the UID and GID credentials
   for checking access using the mapped UID and GID for the tenant.
