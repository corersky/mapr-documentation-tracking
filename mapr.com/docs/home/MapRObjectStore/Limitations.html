MapR Object Store Limitations

   To fully benefit from the functionality of MapR Object Store
   1.0.0-1808, it is important to understand certain limitations and
   restrictions involving protocol support, object naming, and specific
   object and bucket APIs that are not supported.
     * Multiple protocol support limitation
       You can write data via S3 API and read data via NFS/POSIX. But, you
       CANNOT write to NFS and read via the S3 API as NFS has no ability
       to populate the necessary S3 metadata required by MapR Object
       Store.
     * MapR Object Store instance limitation
       You can use only one instance of MapR Object Store on any given
       bucket.
     * Object name character restrictions
       You cannot use object names that contain characters `^*|" are NOT
       supported in Windows and other file systems which do not support
       them.
     * S3 object APIs not supported
          + ObjectACL (Use bucket policies instead)
          + ObjectTorrent
          + ObjectVersions
     * S3 Bucket APIs not supported
          + BucketACL (Use bucket policies instead)
          + BucketCORS (CORS enabled by default on all buckets for all
            HTTP verbs)
          + BucketLifecycle (Not required for Minio erasure coded backend)
          + BucketReplication (Use mc mirror instead)
          + BucketVersions, BucketVersioning (Use s3git)
          + BucketWebsite (Use caddy or nginx)
          + BucketAnalytics, BucketMetrics, BucketLogging (Use bucket
            notification APIs)
          + BucketRequestPayment
          + BucketTagging
     * File deletion limitation
       If you delete a file using MapR Object Store, it will delete the
       metadata file but not the metadata directory of the file.
