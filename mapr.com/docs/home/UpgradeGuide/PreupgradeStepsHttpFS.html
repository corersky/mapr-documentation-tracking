Pre-Upgrade Steps for HttpFS

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade HttpFS with or without
   the MapR Installer.
   You need to back up configuration files if you made configuration
   changes that you want to carry over to the next version.
   Typically, the following configuration files contain changes:
     * /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/webapps/webh
       dfs/WEB-INF/web.xml
     * /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/server.
       xml
     * /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/tomcat-
       users.xml
     * /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/etc/hadoop/httpfs-site.xml

   To back up configuration files, copy the files to a location outside
   the MapR installation. After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the
   updated httpFS installation using the backup.
