Pre-Upgrade Steps for HttpFS

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade HttpFS with or without
   the MapR Installer.
   You need to back up configuration files if you made configuration
   changes that you want to carry over to the next version.
   Typically, the following configuration files contain changes:
     * /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/webapps/webh
       dfs/WEB-INF/web.xml
     * /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/server.
       xml
     * /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/tomcat-
       users.xml
     * /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/etc/hadoop/httpfs-site.xml

   To back up configuration files, copy the files to a location outside
   the MapR installation. After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the
   updated httpFS installation using the backup.

Preserving HttpFS Configuration

   Starting from MEP-6.0.0, preserving of user configuration logic is
   built into HttpFS.
   For a minor version update (for example, HttpFS-1.0-1803 to
   HttpFS-1.0-1808), user configuration from a previous version is copied
   to a folder with an old version timestamp and is also copied to a new
   version conf folder.
