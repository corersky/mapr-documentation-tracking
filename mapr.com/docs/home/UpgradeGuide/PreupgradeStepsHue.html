Pre-Upgrade Steps for Hue

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Hue with or without the
   MapR Installer.
    1. Stop the Hue service:
       maprcli node services -name hue -action stop -nodes <ip_address>
    2. Create a Hue database dump as a JSON object:
       For MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle
source /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/build/env/bin/activate
hue dumpdata > ~/dump-hue-<version>.json
deactivate
       For SQLite
cd /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/desktop
sqlite3 desktop.db .dump > ~/dump-hue-<version>-sqlite.bak
    3. Copy the configuration properties from
       /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/desktop/conf/ to a location outside
       your MapR installation.
       After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the updated Hue
       installation using the backup.

Preserving Hue Configuration

   Starting from MEP-6.0.0, preserving of user configuration logic is
   built into Hue.
   For a major version update (for example, Hue-3.2-1803 to
   Hive-4.2-1808), user configuration from a previous version is only
   copied to a folder with an old version timestamp
   (/HUE_HOME/hue-3.12.0.201707281202).
