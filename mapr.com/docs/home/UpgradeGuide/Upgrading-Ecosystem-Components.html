Upgrading the Expansion Pack Without the MapR Installer

   After you upgrade MapR core without using the MapR Installer, you need
   to upgrade ecosystem components with manual steps. First, verify that
   your repository is configured to use a MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) that
   is supported by your cluster version. Then, upgrade each component
   manually.
   Note: If you installed the cluster with the MapR Installer, do not use
   the following steps to upgrade your ecosystem components. Instead, see
   [1]Upgrading MapR Core With the MapR Installer.

Prerequisite: Set up the MEP Repository

   Complete the following steps on each node in the cluster when you
   upgrade without the MapR Installer:
    1. Verify that each node can access the ecosystem packages associated
       with the MEP version that you want to use. For information on how
       to setup the ecosystem repositories or to manually download each
       package, see [2]Setting Up Repositories.
    2. Update the repository cache to get the latest list of available
       packages:
          + On RedHat/CentOS:
# yum clean all
          + On SUSE:
 # zypper refresh
          + On Ubuntu:
# apt-get update

Manually Upgrade Ecosystem Components

   Review the [3]MapR Expansion Pack Release Notes to determine the list
   of ecosystem components available in the MEP that you have selected.
   Then, complete the manual upgrade steps for each component that you
   want to upgrade.
