Post-Upgrade Steps for Hue

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Hue with or without the
   MapR Installer:
    1. To configure the Hue-livy package after upgrading, see [1]Integrate
       Hue 3.10+ With Spark 2.
    2. After upgrading on Ubuntu, remove the mapr-hue-base package:
apt-get remove mapr-hue-base
    3. Copy the changes that you made for required services in your
       existing hue.ini file into the latest version of the file:
/opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/desktop/conf/hue.ini
       Note: Hue 3.9 uses the old Query editor to work with Hive and
       Impala queries, and introduces new Spark Notebooks. Hue 3.10+ uses
       Notebooks as a replacement for the old Query editor for Hive and
       Impala. If you are upgrading to Hue 3.10+, and you want to have
       access to your saved queries in the old Hive or Impala Query
       editor, you need to configure Hue to use the old Query editor. To
       do this, set the use_new_editor property in the hue.ini file to
       false. For example:
[desktop]
...
  # Choose whether to show the new SQL editor.
  use_new_editor=false
    4. If you use SQLite as the Hue database, load its backup:
         a. If the Hue node runs on Ubuntu, install sqlite3:
apt-get install sqlite3
         b. Run the following commands:
cd /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<new_version>/desktop
mv desktop.db desktop.db.old
sqlite3 desktop.db < ~/dump-hue-<old_version>-sqlite.bak
sqlite3 desktop.db
DELETE FROM django_content_type;

    5. Update the old database schema so that it is compatible with the
       new upgraded version:
source /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<new_version>/bin/activate
hue syncdb --noinput
hue migrate --merge
deactivate
       For example, run the following commands to update the database
       schema so that it is compatible with Hue 4.2+:
source /opt/mapr/hue/hue-4.2.0/bin/activate
hue syncdb --noinput
hue migrate --merge
deactivate
       If you are using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle, and you have trouble
       with the database during the Hue upgrade, you can restore your data
       from the backup that you created during the [2]Pre-Upgrade Steps
       for Hue:
source /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<new_version>/bin/activate
hue loaddata --ignorenonexistent ~/dump-hue-<old_version>.json
deactivate
    6. For upgrades performed without the MapR Installer: If you are using
       Hadoop MRv1, complete the following steps to establish
       communication between Hue and the JobTracker processes:
         a. Remove existing Hue plugins from the MapReduce lib directory:
rm /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-0.20*/lib/hue-plugins-*.jar
         b. Copy new Hue plugins to the MapReduce lib directory:
cp /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/desktop/libs/hadoop/java-lib/hue-plugins-*.jar /o
pt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-0.20*/lib/
            For example, run the following commands to copy the Hue plugin
            for Hue 3.10+:
cp /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.10.0/desktop/libs/hadoop/java-lib/hue-plugins-*.jar /opt/
mapr/hadoop/hadoop-0.20*/lib/
         c. Restart the JobTracker services:
maprcli node services -jobtracker restart -nodes <ip_addresses>
    7. Run configure.sh -R:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       If you do not complete this step, Hue may fail to start and the MCS
       may still display references to the Hue version that you upgraded
       from.
    8. Restart the Hue service:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <ip_address>
