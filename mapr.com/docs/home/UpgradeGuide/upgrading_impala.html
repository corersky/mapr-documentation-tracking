Upgrading Impala

   This section describes how to upgrade Impala without the MapR
   Installer.
    1. Upgrade the mapr-impala package on all Impala nodes in the cluster:
$ sudo yum update mapr-impala
    2. In /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh, complete the
       following steps:
         a. Verify that the Statestore address is set to the address where
            you plan to run the statestore service.
IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST=<IP address hosting statestore>
         b. Change the Catalog service address to the address where you
            plan to run the catalog service.
CATALOG_SERVICE_HOST=<IP address hosting catalog service>
            Refer to [1]Additional Impala Configuration Options for a list
            of other options that you can modify in env.sh.
    3. Verify that hive-site.xml has the following property configured on
       all nodes:
<property>
    <name>hive.metastore.uris</name>
    <value>thrift://<metastore_server_host>:9083</value>
</property>

    4. To upgrade the statestore service, issue the following command:
$ sudo yum update mapr-impala-statestore
    5. To upgrade the catalog service, issue the following command:
$ sudo yum update mapr-impala-catalog
       Note: It is recommended (not required) that you install the catalog
       service on the same node as the statestore service.
    6. To upgrade the impala server, issue the following command:
$ sudo yum update mapr-impala-server
    7. Run configure.sh to refresh the node configuration.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
