Pre-Upgrade Steps for HBase Client

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade HBase Client with or
   without the MapR Installer.
   If you made configuration changes that you want to carry over to the
   next version of HBase Client, you need to back up configuration files.
    1. Copy the configuration files in
       /opt/mapr/hbase/hbase-<version>/conf/ to a location outside the
       MapR installation directory.
    2. After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the updated HBase
       Client by merging the configuration files back into
       /opt/mapr/hbase/hbase-<version>/conf/. See [1]Post-Upgrade Steps
       for HBase Client for more information.
