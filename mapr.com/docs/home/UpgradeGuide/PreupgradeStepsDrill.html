Pre-Upgrade Steps for Drill

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Drill with or without
   the MapR Installer.
   Starting in Drill 1.11, Drill is automatically secured when installed
   in a 6.x MapR cluster with the default MapR security configuration. The
   default security configuration uses MapR security (mapr tickets) to
   provide authentication, authorization, and encryption for cluster
   security. See [1]Securing Drill for more information.
   Note: The MapR default security feature introduced in MapR 6.0 is not
   supported with Drill-on-YARN.
   Note: See [2]Component Versions for Released MEPs for version support
   in each MEP release.

   Preserving Custom Security When Upgrading MapR and Drill

   You can perform a manual upgrade, for example from a secured MapR 5.2
   cluster to 6.0, to preserve your security settings from 5.2. When you
   upgrade, a special file, /opt/mapr/conf/.upgrade_from, checks for
   security settings. If security is set, the same settings carry over to
   6.x.

   During a custom upgrade, Drill configurations are not carried over. You
   must either reconfigure all of your Drill settings, or save your
   previous settings and then override the default Drill settings. You can
   manually secure Drill either by copying over the old
   drill-override.conf file into /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf or
   by updating the /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-distrib.conf
   file with the security settings.

   After you upgrade, you must run [3]configure.sh -R to configure the
   cluster. When you run the configuration script, it adds a
   [4].customSecure file to the /opt/mapr/conf directory. This file calls
   the internal ecosystem scripts, but does not configure Drill.
   If you decide you want to enable the default security option, you can
   do so by running configure.sh with the -secure and
   -forceSecurityDefaults flags, as shown:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -forceSecurityDefaults [ -unsecure | -secure ]
 -C <CLDB_node> -Z <ZK_node>

   Running configure.sh with these flags secures the cluster and supported
   ecosystem components. The internal Drill configuration script
   configures Drill security in the drill-distrib.conf and distrib-env.sh
   files. See [5]Securing Drill.

   Drill Management Service

   Drill can run under the MapR Warden service or under YARN. You can
   upgrade Drill and continue to run Drill under the MapR Warden service.
   If you are currently running Drill under the MapR Warden service, you
   can migrate Drill to run under YARN. If you want to migrate Drill to
   run under YARN, see [6]Migrate Drill to Run Under YARN.

   If you are upgrading Drill to run under Warden, Drill should preserve
   your storage plugin and configuration files when you upgrade. However,
   you should backup and restore your configuration files and UDF JAR
   files.

   Pre-Upgrade Steps

   Complete the following steps on Drill servers and clients before you
   upgrade Drill:
    1. Optionally, back up storage plugin configurations:
         a. Open the [7]Drill Web Console. The Drill node that you use to
            access the Web Console is a node that is currently running the
            Drillbit process.
         b. Click the Storage tab.
         c. Click Update next to a storage plugin.
         d. Copy the configuration to a text file, and save the file.
         e. Repeat steps c and d for each storage plugin configuration
            that you want to save.
    2. To stop the Drillbit service on all nodes, issue the following
       command:
maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action stop -nodes <node hostnames separ
ated by a space>
