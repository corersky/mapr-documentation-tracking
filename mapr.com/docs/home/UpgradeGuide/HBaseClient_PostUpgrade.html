Post-Upgrade Steps for HBase Client

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade HBase Client with or
   without the MapR Installer.
   Merge custom configuration files with the new default files (optional).
    1. If you backed up HBase Client configuration files into a location
       outside the installation directory before upgrading HBase Client,
       you must retrieve them if you want to save your custom
       configuration.
    2. Merge HBase Client configuration files from with the new default
       files in /opt/mapr/hbase/hbase-<version>/conf/. Be sure not to
       simply copy over the configuration files: to avoid overwriting the
       default files, conduct a merge.
