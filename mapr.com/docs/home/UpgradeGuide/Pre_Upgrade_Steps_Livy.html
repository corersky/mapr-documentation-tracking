Pre-Upgrade Steps for Livy

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Livy with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Stop the Livy service if it is installed:
maprcli node services -name livy -action stop -nodes <ip_address>

   If you made configuration changes that you want to carry over to the
   next version, you need to back up configuration files. Typically, the
   following configuration files contain changes:
     * /opt/mapr/livy/livy-<version>/conf/livy.conf
     * /opt/mapr/livy/livy-<version>/conf/livy-env.sh

   To back up configuration files, copy the files to a location outside
   the MapR installation. After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the
   updated Livy installation using the backup.
   Livy is included in the MapR MEP repositories beginning with MEP 4.0.0.
   Before MEP 4.0.0, Livy was included as a package called mapr-hue-livy,
   and released only as a part of Hue. The configuration files for
   mapr-hue-livy have a different location:
     * /opt/mapr/hue-livy/hue-livy-<version>/conf/livy.conf
     * /opt/mapr/hue-livy/hue-livy-<version>/conf/livy-env.sh

   Note:
     * Starting from MEP-6.0, for Livy upgrades, from Livy 0.3 and above,
       user configuration files are saved during upgrade.
     * For Livy upgrades from mapr-hue-livy 3.12, user configuration files
       are NOT saved during upgrade.
     * For Manual Livy upgrades from mapr-hue-livy 3.12 on Ubuntu, you
       need to remove the old mapr-hue livy package manually.
