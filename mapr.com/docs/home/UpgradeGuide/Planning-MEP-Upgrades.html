Planning MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) Upgrades

   The set of ecosystem components that you run in the cluster must all
   belong to the same MEP.

   As of MapR 5.2, you must install ecosystem components as part of a MEP.
   You will be offered packs to install that contain selected component
   versions. After upgrading, you may want to upgrade to a more recent MEP
   to get the latest patch releases or newer versions of ecosystem
   components.

   Most MapR core versions support multiple MEPs, but the set of ecosystem
   components that you run in the cluster must all belong to the same MEP.
   You cannot selectively upgrade components. When you upgrade a MEP, all
   components are replaced with the versions contained in the newly
   selected MEP.

   To compare ecosystem component versions across MEPs, see [1]Component
   Versions for Released MEPs.

   For details on the ecosystem components available in each MEP and the
   list of MEPs supported by your MapR cluster version, see the [2]MapR
   Expansion Pack Release Notes.

   For API or behavioral changes associated with new ecosystem components,
   see the documentation for the individual component under [3]Ecosystem
   Components.
