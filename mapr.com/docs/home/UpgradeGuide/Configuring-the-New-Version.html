Step 5: Enable New Features

   After upgrading MapR Core without the MapR Installer (using a manual
   offline or rolling upgrade method), enable the new features.

   This task is applicable to all manual upgrade methods: offline,
   rolling, and manual rolling upgrades. After a successful manual
   upgrade, administrators have the option to enable new features that are
   not enabled by default.

   Based on the version that you upgraded from, the following features can
   be enabled. Once your features are enabled, run simple and non-trivial
   health checks to verify cluster health. These features are
   automatically enabled with a fresh install.
   Important: All nodes in your cluster must be upgraded before enabling
   new features. In addition, all clients that access the cluster, must be
   upgraded before enabling new features. Do NOT enable new features if
   your MapR 6.0 or later cluster is configured with MEP 3.0.x. For MapR
   6.0 or later, all nodes must be upgraded to MEP 4.0 or later before you
   enable MapR 6.0 or later features. MEP 3.0.x is supported only for
   upgrade purposes. See [1]MEP Support by MapR Core Version.

Enable Feature Command

   Features are enabled using the maprcli cluster feature enable command.
   A list of the features are obtained using the maprcli cluster feature
   list command. See [2]maprcli cluster commands for more information.
   Attention: It is strongly recommended that all of the features be
   enabled: maprcli cluster feature enable -all.
   Note: The maprcli config save command is no longer available for
   enabling features.

   Once your features are enabled, run simple and non-trivial health
   checks to verify cluster health. These features are automatically
   enabled with a fresh install.

Feature Summary

   Feature Feature Name Version Available Description
   Data at rest encryption mfs.feature.dare As of 6.1 Enables support for
   encrypting data at rest on the MapR cluster. See [3]Enabling Encryption
   of Data at Rest for more information.
   Data tiering mfs.feature.storage.tiering.support As of 6.1 Enables
   support for offloading data to different storage tiers. See [4]Enabling
   Tiering for more information.
   Name container threshold mfs.feature.name.container.size.control As of
   6.0.1 Enables support for setting a limit on the size of data stored in
   the name container for a volume.
   Persist writes to disk mfs.feature.disk.flush As of 6.0.1 Enables
   flushing writes to disk before acknowledging the client if the
   attribute is set on files and/or directories.
   External IPs for CLDB cldb.feature.external.ip As of 6.0 Enables
   support for external IP addresses and port forwarding. Set the
   environment variables (as described [5]here) before enabling this
   feature. After enabling this feature, perform a CLDB failover to allow
   MapR Filesystem to re-register.
   Enforce guaranteed minimum replication
   mfs.feature.enforce.min.replication As of 6.0 Enables support for
   enforcing minimum number of replicas for (read-write) volumes during
   write operations.
   Note: Do not enable this feature before upgrading all the nodes in the
   cluster. If you enable this feature before upgrading all the nodes,
   MapR Filesystem will shut down on the nodes that have not yet been
   upgraded.
   CLDB snapshot improvements mfs.feature.snapshotdb.lite As of 6.0 After
   enabling this feature, do a [6]CLDB failover to avail of the
   significant performance improvements for snapshot create and delete
   operations.
   Directcopy for Autosetup Replication, Change Data Capture and Secondary
   Index features. mfs.feature.db.streams.v6.support As of 6.0 Enables the
   following:
     * MapR Database tables and MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka to use
       the directcopy option with the autosetup replication feature.
     * MapR Database table Change Data Capture (CDC) feature.
     * MapR Database Secondary Index feature.

   Container identity reuse cldb.feature.cid.reuse As of 5.2.1 Support for
   container identity reuse.
   Streams connect support mfs.feature.streams.connect.support As of 5.2.1
   Enables support for Kafka Connect in the distributed mode.
   Fast inode scan for mirroring mfs.feature.fastinodescan.support As of
   5.2.1 Enables fast mirroring when there are large numbers of files with
   few changes.
   Hardlinks mfs.feature.hardlinks.support As of 5.2 Enables support for
   retrieving hard links on files.
   Extended Attributes mfs.feature.fileace.support As of 5.2 Enables
   support for adding, retrieving, and removing extended attributes on
   files and directories.
   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka and MapR Database as a document
   database mfs.feature.db.json.support As of 5.1 Enables the use of
   [7]MapR Streams and [8]MapR Database as a Document Database.
   Access Control Expressions for MapR Filesystem
   mfs.feature.fileace.support As of 5.1 Enables the setting of Access
   Control Expressions on filesystem and whole volume data.
   MapR Auditing mfs.feature.audit.support As of 5.0 Logs audit records of
   cluster-administration operations and operations on directories, files,
   and tables.
   MapR Volume Upgrade mfs.feature.volume.upgrade,
   mfs.feature.rwmirror.support As of 5.0 Enables support for promotable
   mirrors on both old-format and new-format volumes.
   MapR Database Table Replication mfs.feature.db.repl.support As of 4.1
   Enables support for MapR Database table replication.
   Promotable Mirror Volumes mfs.feature.rwmirror.support As of 4.0.2
   Enables support for promotable mirror volumes.
   Reduce On-Disk Container Size cldb.reduce.container.size As of 4.0.2
   Reduces the space required on-disk for each container. The reduction of
   the on-disk container size takes effect after the CLDB service restarts
   or fails over.
   Note: After enabling this feature on a cluster with more than a million
   containers, it may take some time for the initial failover to complete
   because the CLDB will re-write container location tables and storage
   pool container map tables. However, this delay will not reoccur with
   any subsequent failovers.
   Bulk loading of Data to MapR Database Tables
   mfs.feature.db.bulkload.support As of 3.1.1 Enables support for bulk
   loading of data to MapR Database tables. Used when upgrade from MapR
   version 3.1 or earlier.
   Access Control Expressions and Table Region Merges
   mfs.feature.db.ace.support, mfs.feature.db.regionmerge.support,
   mfs.feature.filecipherbit.support As of 3.1

   The following features enable support for [9]Managing Access Control
   Expressions (ACEs) and [10]table region merge. Used when upgrading from
   MapR version 3.0.x.
mfs.feature.db.ace.support
mfs.feature.db.regionmerge.support

   These features are automatically enabled with a fresh install or when
   you upgrade from a version earlier than 3.0.x.
   Important: After enabling ACEs for MapR tables, table access is
   enforced by table ACEs instead of the file system. As a result, all
   newly created tables are owned by root and have their mode bits set to
   777.

   The following feature enables encryption of network traffic to or from
   a file, directory, or MapR Database table with the following feature.
   This feature is enabled after [11]security features are enabled on your
   cluster.
mfs.feature.filecipherbit.support

   Warning: Clusters with active security features will experience job
   failure until this configuration value is set.
