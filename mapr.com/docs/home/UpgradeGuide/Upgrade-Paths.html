Upgrading MapR Core or MEP Components

   Depending on your current configuration, you may choose to upgrade the
   MapR version (MapR Core), ecosystem components, clients, or MapR
   Monitoring components.

Getting Started with Upgrades

   Most upgrades involve moving from one version of MapR Core to another
   version and upgrading MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) components at the same
   time. To learn about the different methods you can use to execute this
   kind of upgrade, see [1]Upgrade Workflows.

Upgrading a MapR Expansion Pack (MEP)

   To upgrade an ecosystem component, you must upgrade the MEP to which it
   belongs. MEPs can be upgraded when you upgrade MapR Core or
   independently of a MapR Core upgrade. If your MapR Core release
   supports multiple MEP versions, you might be able to upgrade to a
   different MEP without upgrading MapR Core. See [2]MEP Support by MapR
   Core Version.

   If a component is supported by your current MEP, you can add the
   component at any time by using manual steps or the Incremental Install
   function of the MapR Installer. See [3]Upgrading MapR Expansion Packs.

Upgrading MapR Clients

   The MapR Client is a part of MapR Core. You upgrade MapR client nodes
   after you upgrade the MapR cluster nodes. See [4]Planning Upgrades to
   MapR Clients.

Upgrading MapR Monitoring

   MapR Monitoring components are available as part of the MapR Expansion
   Pack (MEP) that you selected for the cluster. Once MapR Monitoring is
   installed, you can upgrade MapR Monitoring components as part of the
   MEP upgrade process. You can upgrade a MEP without having to upgrade
   MapR Core, provided the MEP you plan to upgrade to is supported by the
   current release. See [5]Upgrading MapR Expansion Packs.
