Pre-Upgrade Steps for Hive

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Hive with or without
   the MapR Installer.

   You need to back up the metastore database in case an error occurs
   during the Hive upgrade. You also need to back up configuration files
   if you made configuration changes that you want to carry over to the
   next version.
    1. Back up the metastore database.
       mysqldump -u<user> -p<passwd> <metastore_db_name> -r
       metastore-db-dump.sql
    2. Copy the configuration files in /opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/conf/
       to a location outside the MapR installation directory.
       After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the updated Hive
       installation using the backup.
    3. Stop Hive services.
maprcli node services -name hivemeta -action stop -nodes <list of hive nodes>
maprcli node services -name hs2 -action stop -nodes <list of hive nodes>
maprcli node services -name  hcat -action stop -nodes <list of hive nodes>

Preserving Hive Configuration

   Starting from MEP-5.0.1, preserving of user configuration logic is
   built into Hive.
     * For a minor version update (for example, Hive-2.1-1803 to
       Hive-2.1-1808), user configuration from a previous version is
       copied to a folder with an old version timestamp and is also copied
       to a new version conf folder.
     * For a major version update (for example, Hive-1.2-1710 to
       Hive-2.1-1808), user configuration from a previous version is only
       copied to a folder with an old version timestamp.
