Upgrading the Expansion Pack With the MapR Installer

   If the cluster that you want to upgrade was installed using the MapR
   Installer, you can use the MapR Installer to upgrade the MapR Expansion
   Pack (MEP).
   Before you begin, verify that all ecosystem components are [1]prepared
   for an upgrade.
   Warning: Service failures, job failures, or the loss of customized
   configuration files can occur if you do not perform the steps to
   prepare ecosystem components for an upgrade.
    1. Update the MapR Installer. For more information, see [2]Updating
       the MapR Installer.
       This step ensures that the MapR Installer has access to the latest
       packages.
    2. Halt jobs and applications. Stop accepting new jobs and
       applications, and stop YARN applications.
# yarn application -list
# yarn application -kill <ApplicationId>
       You might also need specific commands to terminate custom
       applications.
    3. Launch the MapR Installer URL ( https://<hostname/IPaddress>:9443).
    4. Select the Incremental Install option.
    5. Select the MEP Version to which you want to upgrade, and complete
       the upgrade through the MapR Installer.
    6. Once the upgrade through the MapR Installer is complete, perform
       the post-upgrade steps. See [3]Finishing the Expansion Pack
       Upgrade.
