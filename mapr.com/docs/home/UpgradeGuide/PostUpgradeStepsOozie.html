Post-Upgrade Steps for Oozie

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Oozie with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Add customized properties from the configuration files that you
       saved before the upgrade to the files in the new Oozie conf
       directory: /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/conf/.
    2. If your Oozie installation is configured to use a MySQL or Oracle
       database and you are upgrading to a new Oozie version, copy the
       JDBC driver jar file for MySQL or Oracle to the following
       directory:
/opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<oozie version>/libext
    3. Run configure.sh -R:
# /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
    4. Run the following command to upgrade the database schema:
# /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/bin/ooziedb.sh upgrade -run
    5. Start any Oozie coordinators that you stopped before the upgrade.
    6. If needed, update the Oozie shared libraries as described in
       [1]Updating the Oozie Shared Libraries.
