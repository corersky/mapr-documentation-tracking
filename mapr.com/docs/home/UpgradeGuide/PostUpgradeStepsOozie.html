Post-Upgrade Steps for Oozie

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Oozie with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Add customized properties from the configuration files that you
       saved before the upgrade to the files in the new Oozie conf
       directory: /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/conf/.
       For example, if you use a MySQL database with Oozie, make sure that
       the oozie-site.xml contains the correct properties for MySQL.
    2. If your Oozie installation is configured to use a MySQL or Oracle
       database and you are upgrading to a new Oozie version, copy the
       JDBC driver jar file for MySQL or Oracle to the following
       directory:
/opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<oozie version>/libext
    3. If it is present, remove the old warden.oozie.conf under the
       /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/ directory before running the configure.sh -R
       command:
# rm -rf /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.oozie.conf
    4. Run configure.sh -R:
# /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
    5. Stop the Oozie service:
# sudo -u mapr maprcli node services -name oozie -action stop-nodes <nodelist>
    6. Run the following command to upgrade the database schema:
# /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/bin/ooziedb.sh upgrade -run
    7. Start the Oozie service:
# sudo -u mapr maprcli node services -name oozie -action start -nodes <nodelist>
    8. Start any Oozie coordinators that you stopped before the upgrade.
    9. If needed, update the Oozie shared libraries as described in
       [1]Updating the Oozie Shared Libraries.
