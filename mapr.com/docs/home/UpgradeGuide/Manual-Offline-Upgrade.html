Offline and Manual Upgrade

   The offline, manual upgrade procedure is suitable for upgrading small
   clusters. On large clusters, these steps are commonly performed on all
   nodes in parallel using scripts and/or remote management tools.

   This procedure assumes you have planned and prepared for the upgrade as
   described earlier, and the cluster meets prerequisites, including the
   correct JDK for the version you are upgrading to. See the [1]JDK
   Support Matrix for more information.
   Note: An offline upgrade is performed as the root user or with sudo.

   At the end of this procedure, you use yum update or zypper update on
   RHEL/CentOS or SUSE to upgrade packages. Ignore any warnings that
   certain packages are not installed. Packages will be upgraded correctly
   and no additional packages will be installed.
    1. Notify stakeholders of the impending upgrade, and then stop
       accepting new jobs and applications. Terminate running jobs and
       applications by running maprcli commands on appropriate nodes in
       the cluster.
       For YARN applications, use the following commands:
# yarn application -list
          # yarn application -kill <ApplicationId>
    2. Disconnect NFS mounts. Unmount the MapR NFS share from all clients
       connected to it, including other nodes in the cluster. This allows
       all processes accessing the cluster via NFS to disconnect
       gracefully.
       For example, if the cluster is mounted at /mapr: # umount /mapr
    3. Display the services on each node in the cluster, and stop
       ecosystem component services on the nodes.
# maprcli node list -columns hostname,csvc
# maprcli node services -multi '[{ "name": "hue", "action": "stop"}, { "name": "
oozie", "action": "stop"}, { "name": "hs2", "action": "stop"}]' -nodes <hostname
s>
    4. Determine where CLDB and ZooKeeper services are installed.
    5. Stop Warden on CLDB nodes first, and then on all remaining nodes.
    6. Stop ZooKeeper on all nodes where it is installed.
    7. Ensure that no stale MapR processes are running. If so, stop the
       processes:
ps -ef | grep mapr
pkill -u mapr
    8. Remove any existing patches.
         a. Run one of the following commands to determine if a patch is
            installed.
               o RHEL/CentOS and SUSE: rpm -qa mapr-patch
               o Ubuntu: dpkg l | grep mapr-patch
            If the command displays no output, no patch is installed.
         b. If one or more patches are installed, run one of the following
            commands to remove the patches:
               o RHEL/CentOS or SUSE: sudo rpm -e mapr-patch
               o Ubuntu: sudo apt-get -y remove mapr-patch
    9. Upgrade MapR core packages by installing the appropriate MapR
       package key.
          + RHEL/CentOS: sudo rpm --import
            http://package.mapr.com/releases/pub/maprgpg.key
          + SUSE: No package key needed.
          + Ubuntu: wget -O -
            http://package.mapr.com/releases/pub/maprgpg.key | sudo
            apt-key add -
   10. Upgrade these MapR core component and MapR hadoop common packages
       on all nodes where packages exist.
       Components to upgrade are:
          + mapr-cldb
          + mapr-core
          + mapr-core-internal
          + mapr-fileserver
          + mapr-hadoop-core
          + mapr-historyserver
          + mapr-mapreduce2
          + mapr-nfs
          + mapr-nodemanager
          + mapr-resourcemanager
          + mapr-webserver
          + mapr-zookeeper
          + mapr-zk-internal
       When using yum update or zypper update, do not use a wildcard such
       as "mapr-*" to upgrade all MapR packages, which could erroneously
       include Hadoop ecosystem components such as mapr-hive and mapr-pig.
          + RHEL/CentOS:
yum update mapr-cldb mapr-core mapr-core-internal mapr-fileserver mapr-hadoop-co
re mapr-historyserver mapr-mapreduce2 mapr-nfs mapr-nodemanager mapr-resourceman
ager mapr-webserver mapr-zookeeper mapr-zk-internal
          + SUSE:
zypper update mapr-cldb mapr-compat-suse mapr-core mapr-core-internal mapr-files
erver mapr-hadoop-core mapr-historyserver mapr-mapreduce2 mapr-nfs mapr-nodemana
ger mapr-resourcemanager mapr-webserver mapr-zookeeper mapr-zk-internal
          + Ubuntu: First get a list of the MapR packages installed on the
            node, and then run apt-get install on the listed packages.
dpkg --list | grep "mapr" | grep -P "^ii"| awk '{ print $2}'|tr "\n" " "
                            apt-get install <package-list>
   11. Verify that packages were installed successfully on all nodes.
       Confirm that there were no errors during installation, and check
       that /opt/mapr/MapRBuildVersion contains the expected value.
       For example:
# cat /opt/mapr/MapRBuildVersion
6.0.0.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.GA
