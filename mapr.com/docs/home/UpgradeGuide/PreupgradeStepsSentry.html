Pre-Upgrade Steps for Sentry

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Sentry with or without
   the MapR Installer.
   You must stop the Sentry service before you upgrade. If you modified
   the configuration files in your current installation of Sentry, you can
   back up the configuration files to preserve the changes that you want
   to carry over to the next version.
   To stop the Sentry service, issue one of the following commands:
     * If the warden.sentry.conf exists in the /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/
       directory:
maprcli node services -name sentry -action stop -nodes <list of Sentry service n
odes>
     * If the warden.sentry.conf does not exist in the
       /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/ directory:
/opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<SENTRY_VERSION>/bin/sentry-daemon.sh stop

   To back up the configuration files, copy the files in
   /opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<version>/conf/ to a location outside of the
   MapR installation. After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the
   updated Sentry installation using the backup.

Preserving Sentry Configuration

   Starting from MEP 5.0.1, preserving of user configuration logic is
   built into Sentry.
     * For a minor version update (for example, Sentry-1.7-1803 to
       Sentry-1.7-1808), user configuration from a previous version is
       copied to a folder with an old version timestamp and is also copied
       to a new version conf folder.
     * For a major version update (for example, Sentry-1.6-1707 to
       Sentry-1.7-1808), user configuration from a previous version is
       only copied to a folder with an old version timestamp.
