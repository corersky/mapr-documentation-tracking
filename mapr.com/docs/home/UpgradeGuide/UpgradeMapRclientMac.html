Upgrading the MapR Client in Mac OS X

   This section describes how to upgrade the MapR Client on Mac OS X.

   When you upgrade the MapR client on Mac OS X, you need to rename the
   existing client directory, install the new version, and then merge the
   configuration files.
    1. Rename the existing client installation directory. For example, you
       can rename /opt/mapr to /opt_old/mapr.
    2. Complete the installation steps in [1]Installing the MapR Client on
       Mac OS X.
    3. To retain existing configurations and accept the new defaults,
       merge the contents of the following directories in the previous
       installation with the ones in the new installation:
          + opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/etc/hadoop
          + opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-0.20.0/conf
