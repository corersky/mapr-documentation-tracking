Pre-Upgrade Steps for MapR Monitoring

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade MapR Monitoring
   Components with or without the MapR Installer.
   During an upgrade using the MapR Installer, a script backs up many of
   the configuration files. However, whether or not you are upgrading
   manually or by using the MapR Installer, it is a best practice to back
   up the files manually in case an error occurs or if the specific file
   you customized is not automatically backed up by the script.
   Before performing the pre-upgrade steps, note these important
   considerations:
     * The MapR Monitoring upgrade is an offline upgrade and not a rolling
       upgrade.
     * This upgrade procedure is customized for the MapR implementation of
       the monitoring components. Because the MapR implementation has a
       narrow focus and there are numerous components, the upgrade steps
       are simplified. MapR upgrade documentation does not include all of
       the upgrade steps that are included in the vendor documentation for
       each component. Before starting the upgrade process, consider
       familiarizing yourself with the vendor-upgrade steps to determine
       if your environment requires extra measures to protect data and
       configurations.

          + [2]Kibana upgrade
          + [3]Search Guard upgrade
          + [4]Grafana upgrade
     * This upgrade sequence does not implement security in the MapR
       Monitoring components. If the cluster you are upgrading is secure,
       the security keys will be deleted when you upgrade the monitoring
       packages. You must regenerate the keys and copy them to the
       appropriate nodes after upgrading. The [5]Post-Upgrade Steps for
       MapR Monitoring provide links to the installation procedures that
       provide this information.

    1. Before backing up configuration files, ensure that your
       Elasticsearch and Kibana indexes are not affected by the upgrade:
       Note: This step assumes that log monitoring is configured. You can
       skip this step if your cluster is not configured for log
       monitoring.
         a. If you are using Elasticsearch version 2.x, upgrade your
            Elasticsearch index to version 6. For upgrade information,
            see:
            [6]https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/cur
            rent/reindex-upgrade.html
            You need to upgrade your Elasticsearch index if your cluster
            is running a MEP in the range 1.1 through 3.0.x. See the
            following table. MEPs 1.1 through 3.0.x use Elasticsearch
            version 2.3.3. If your cluster is running a MEP in the range
            4.0.0 through 5.0.x, you are using Elasticsearch 5.4.1, and
            you do NOT need to upgrade the index. For more information
            about Elasticsearch / Search Guard version information, see
            [7]this website.

            For more information about the MapR Monitoring component
            versions included in each MEP, see [8]Component Versions for
            Released MEPs.
         b. Create a snapshot of the Kibana index to capture index
            information before the upgrade. This information will be
            restored after the upgrade. For snapshot information, see
            [9]https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6
            /modules-snapshots.html.
    2. Before you upgrade metric monitoring components, create a backup of
       the configuration files to a location outside your MapR
       installation directory. The following configuration file-lists
       include files that are commonly used for configuration and may not
       include every file that you may have customized.
          + Collectd configuration files:
               o /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.collectd.conf
               o /opt/mapr/collectd/collectd-<version>/etc/collectd.conf
               o /etc/logrotate.d/collectd
          + Grafana configuration files:
               o /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.grafana.conf
               o /opt/mapr/grafana/grafana-<version>/etc/grafana/grafana.i
                 ni
               o /opt/mapr/grafana/grafana-
                 <version>/etc/grafana/ldap.toml
          + OpenTSDB configuration files:
               o /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.opentsdb.conf
               o /opt/mapr/opentsdb/opentsdb-<version>/etc/opentsdb/opents
                 db.conf
               o /opt/mapr/opentsdb/opentsdb-<version>/etc/opentsdb/logbac
                 k.xml
               o opt/mapr/opentsdb/opentsdb-<version>/bin/tsdb_cluster_mgm
                 t.sh (This file is not automatically backed up.)
          + For Elasticsearch:
               o /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.elasticsearch.conf
               o /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elast
                 icsearch/elasticsearch.yml
               o /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elast
                 icsearch/logging.yml
               o /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elast
                 icsearch/curator.yml
               o /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elast
                 icsearch/curator_actions/delete_indices.yml (This file is
                 not automatically backed up.)
          + For OpenTSDB:
               o /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.opentsdb.conf
               o /opt/mapr/opentsdb/opentsdb-<version>/etc/opentsdb/opents
                 db.conf
               o /opt/mapr/opentsdb/opentsdb-<version>/etc/opentsdb/logbac
                 k.xml
               o opt/mapr/opentsdb/opentsdb-<version>/bin/tsdb_cluster_mgm
                 t.sh (This file is not automatically backed up.)
    3. Before you upgrade log monitoring components, create a backup of
       the following files to a location outside your MapR installation
       directory. The following configuration file lists include files
       that are commonly used for configuration and may not include every
       file that you may have customized.
          + Kibana configuration files:
               o /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.kibana.conf
               o /opt/mapr/kibana/kibana-<version>/etc/conf/kibana.js
          + fluentd configuration files:
               o /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.fluentd.conf
               o /opt/mapr/fluentd/fluentd-<version>/etc/fluentd/fluentd.c
                 onf
               o /opt/mapr/fluentd/fluentd-<version>/etc/fluentd/es_config
                 .conf
               o /opt/mapr/fluentd/fluentd-<version>/etc/fluentd/maprfs_co
                 nfig.conf
               o /opt/mapr/fluentd/fluentd-<version>/etc/fluentd/grok-patt
                 erns
               o /etc/logrotate/fluentd
          + Elasticsearch configuration files:
               o /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.elasticsearch.conf
               o /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elast
                 icsearch/elasticsearch.yml
               o /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elast
                 icsearch/logging.yml
               o /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elast
                 icsearch/curator.yml
               o /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>/etc/elast
                 icsearch/curator_actions/delete_indices.yml (This file is
                 not automatically backed up.)
    4. Stop all MapR Monitoring Services on the cluster.
         a. To stop collectd, run the following command:
maprcli node services -name collectd -nodes <space separated list of hostname/IP
addresses> -action stop

         b. To stop Grafana, run the following command:
maprcli node services -name grafana -nodes <space separated list of hostname/IPa
ddresses> -action stop
         c. To stop OpenTSDB, run the following command:
maprcli node services -name opentsdb -nodes <space separated list of hostname/IP
addresses> -action stop
         d. To stop Kibana, run the following command:

dresses> -action stop
         e. To stop fluentd, run the following command:

ddresses> -action stop
         f. To stop Elasticsearch, run the following command:
