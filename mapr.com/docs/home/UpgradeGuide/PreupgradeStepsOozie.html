Pre-Upgrade Steps for Oozie

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Oozie with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Stop any jobs or coordinators that are in a RUNNING or SUSPENDED
       state.
    2. For upgrades without the MapR Installer: Stop the Oozie service.
# maprcli node services -name oozie -action stop -nodes <node names>
    3. (OPTIONAL) Back up Oozie configuration files and save them to a
       location outside the MapR installation. Configuration properties
       are located in /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/conf/. After
       upgrading, you can reapply changes to the updated Oozie
       installation using the backup.
    4. For upgrades without the MapR Installer: Remove the old share
       libraries and examples from the following directories:
maprfs:///oozie/share
maprfs:///user/${user.name}/examples
    5. For upgrades from MEP 3.0.x to MEP 4.0 (or later): If you are
       upgrading Oozie 4.3.0 on a secure cluster and you have not already
       configured SSL on your Oozie server and client, you must perform
       the following steps:
         a. [1]Configuring Oozie on a Secure Cluster
         b. [2]Configuring Oozie Clients to Use SSL (Oozie 4.3.0)

Preserving Oozie Configuration

   Starting from 1808 release, MEP 4.1.2, MEP 5.0.1, MEP 6.0.0 and newer
   versions, in case of a version update, configuration from a previously
   installed version of Oozie is stored in a folder with an old version
   timestamp.
