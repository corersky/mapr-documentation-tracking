Pre-Upgrade Steps for Oozie

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Oozie with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Stop any jobs or coordinators that are in a RUNNING or SUSPENDED
       state.
    2. For upgrades without the MapR Installer: Stop the Oozie service.
# sudo -u mapr maprcli node services -name oozie -action stop -nodes <node names
>
    3. Back up Oozie configuration files and save them to a location
       outside the MapR installation. Configuration properties are located
       in /opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/conf/. After upgrading, you can
       reapply changes to the updated Oozie installation using the backup.
    4. For upgrades without the MapR Installer: Remove the old share
       libraries and examples from the following directories:
maprfs:///oozie/share
maprfs:///user/${user.name}/examples
    5. For upgrades from MEP 3.0.x to MEP 4.0 (or later): If you are
       upgrading Oozie 4.3.0 on a secure cluster and you have not already
       configured SSL on your Oozie server and client, you must perform
       the following steps:
         a. [1]Configuring the Oozie Server to use SSL
         b. [2]Configuring Oozie Clients to Use SSL (Oozie 4.3.0)
