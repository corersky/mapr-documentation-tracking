Upgrading MapR Ecosystem Packs

   Describes how to upgrade MapR Ecosystem Packs (MEPs), either as part of
   a MapR Core upgrade or to take advantage of a new MEP for the current
   version of MapR Core.

   A MapR Ecosystem Pack (MEP) provides a set of ecosystem components that
   are fully tested by MapR to be interoperable except where noted. For
   more information about MEPs, see [1]MapR Ecosystem Packs.
