Set Up the Internet Repository: SUSE

   This section describes how to add an internet repository using a zypper
   command.

   As root or sudo, you add the repository for the latest packages using a
   zypper command to specify URLs to the packages. See the [1]MapR Release
   Notes for the URLs for all release packages.
    1. Change to the root user or use sudo.
    2. Add the repository for MapR packages, replacing <version> with the
       version of MapR that you want to install.
       zypper ar https://package.mapr.com/releases/v<version>/suse/
       maprtech
    3. Add the repository for MapR ecosystem packages.
       zypper ar https://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/suse/
       maprecosystem
    4. If your connection to the Internet is through a proxy server, set
       the http_proxy environment variable before installation.
http_proxy=http://<host>:<port>
export http_proxy
    5. Update the system package index.
       zypper refresh
