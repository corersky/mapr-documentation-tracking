Post-Upgrade Steps for MapR Monitoring

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade MapR Monitoring
   Components with or without the MapR Installer.
    1. After you upgrade monitoring components, add customized properties
       from the configuration files that you backed up before the upgrade
       to the files in the new installation directories.
       Backups of many of the MapR Monitoring component configuration
       files are stored in the
       /opt/mapr/<component>/<component>-<new_version>/etc directory and
       its subdirectories. During the backup of a configuration file, the
       upgrade script appends the component version number to the
       filename. For example, the backup filename for collectd.conf is
       collectd.conf-5.5.1. Therefore, if you did not manually back up the
       configuration files before upgrading MapR Monitoring components,
       you may be able to retrieve the configuration.
    2. On each node in the cluster, run configure.sh with the -R option.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
    3. If you created a snapshot of the Kibana index as described in
       [1]Pre-Upgrade Steps for MapR Monitoring, restore the snapshot to
       ensure that you have access to index information that was present
       before the upgrade. See
       [2]https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/modu
       les-snapshots.html.
    4. If you need to configure the MapR Monitoring components for
       security, follow the steps in the installation procedures to
       generate the necessary files and distribute them across the
       cluster:
          + [3]Step 8: Install Metrics Monitoring
          + [4]Step 9: Install Log Monitoring
