Securing the Upgraded Cluster

   Nonsecure clusters can be secured after the upgrade process.

   If your cluster was nonsecure before you upgraded it, the cluster will
   remain nonsecure after the upgrade. To secure the cluster after a
   successful upgrade, see [1]Getting Started with MapR Security.
