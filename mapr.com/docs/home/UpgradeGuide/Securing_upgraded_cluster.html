Securing the Upgraded Cluster

   Nonsecure clusters can be secured after the upgrade process.

   If your cluster was nonsecure before you upgraded it, the cluster will
   remain nonsecure after the upgrade. If you used the manual-rolling or
   offline-manual workflows to upgrade, and you want to add security, see
   [1]Getting Started with MapR Security.

   If you used the MapR Installer workflow to upgrade, and you want to add
   security, see [2]Using the Enable MapR Secure Cluster Option.
