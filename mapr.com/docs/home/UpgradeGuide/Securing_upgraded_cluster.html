Securing the Upgraded Cluster

   Nonsecure clusters can be secured after the upgrade process.

   If your cluster was nonsecure before you upgraded it, the cluster will
   remain nonsecure after the upgrade. To secure the cluster manually
   after a successful upgrade, see [1]Getting Started with MapR Security.
   To secure the cluster using the MapR Installer, see [2]Using the Enable
   MapR Secure Cluster Option.
