Upgrading Clients

   After you upgrade your cluster, you may also need to upgrade your MapR
   Client or MapR POSIX Client.

   When you upgrade the cluster, consider if your MapR client or your MapR
   POSIX client needs to be upgraded as well. See [1]Planning Upgrades to
   MapR Clients.

   Additionally, MapR POSIX loopbacknfs clients can be migrated to
   FUSE-based POSIX clients on Basic POSIX client packages. MapR POSIX
   loopbacknfs clients can not be migrated to Platinum POSIX client
   packages.

   See [2]Migrating to FUSE-based POSIX Clients for more information.
   Note: Basic and Platinum POSIX client packages are recommended for
   fresh installation and for all new clusters.
