Set Up the Local Repository: SUSE

   To create a local repository, download your files from the Internet and
   then add the repositories to each node in the cluster.

   You create a local repository from files that you download from the
   internet, and then add the repositories to each node in the cluster.
   The files that you download differ from version to version. See the
   [1]Packages and Dependencies for MapR Software for the URLs for all
   versions.
    1. Login as root on the node or use sudo.
    2. Create the following directory if it does not exist:
       /var/www/html/zypper/base
    3. On a computer that is connected to the internet, download the
       following files, substituting the appropriate <version> and
       <datestamp>.
       For example:
https://package.mapr.com/releases/<version>/suse/mapr-<version>GA.rpm.tgz
    4. Copy the files to /var/www/html/zypper/base on the node, and
       extract them there.
       For example:
tar -xvzf <product_package>.rpm.tgz
    5. Create the base repository headers.
       createrepo /var/www/html/zypper/base
    6. Verify that the new /var/www/html/zypper/base/repodata directory
       contains the following files.
       filelists.xml.gz, other.xml.gz, primary.xml.gz, repomd.xml
    7. Add the repositories for MapR and the MapR ecosystem packages to
       each node in the cluster.
