Manual Rolling Upgrade Description

   In a manual rolling upgrade, you upgrade the MapR software one node at
   a time so that the cluster as a whole remains operational throughout
   the process.
   Note: Rolling upgrades to MapR 6.0 or later are supported only for
   clusters running MapR 5.2.x with MEP 3.0.1 or later. If you are
   upgrading from an earlier version, upgrade MapR core manually and
   offline. See [1]Offline and Manual Upgrade Procedure.

Before you Upgrade

   Perform the following steps before you begin a manual rolling upgrade:
     * Determine the upgrade groups. To see a list of services on each
       node, you can run the following command:
maprcli node list -columns hostname,csvc
     * If the cluster is secure, the MapR Admin user must have a security
       ticket created before running the upgrade. Otherwise, some upgrade
       commands will not run.

Group Upgrade Order

   Upgrade cluster nodes in groups based on the services running on each
   node. Upgrade groups of nodes in the following order:

   CAPTION:

   Group Nodes in this Group
   1 Each node only has Zookeeper. This establishes a stable ZooKeeper
   quorum on the new version, which will remain active through the rest of
   the upgrade process.
   2 Each node only has MapR gateway or it has ZooKeeper. When upgrading
   from MapR 6.0 or 6.0.1 to MapR 6.1 or later, the MapR gateway must be
   upgraded before Fileserver.
   3

   Each node only has Fileserver or it has Fileserver, MapR gateway, and
   Zookeeper.
   4 Each node only has NodeManager or it has NodeManager, FileServer,
   MapR gateway, and Zookeeper
   5 Each node only has ResourceManager or it has ResourceManager,
   NodeManager, FileServer, MapR gateway, and Zookeeper. When you upgrade
   nodes in this group, upgrade nodes with the standyby ResourceManagers
   before you upgrade the node with the active ResourceManager.
   6

   Each node has ResourceManager, NodeManager, FileServer, MapR gateway,
   and Zookeeper.
   7

   Each node only has CLDB server or it has CLDB server, ResourceManager,
   NodeManager, FileServer, MapR gateway, and Zookeeper. When you upgrade
   nodes in this group, upgrade nodes with the slave CLDB before you
   upgrade the node with the master CLDB.

Package Upgrade Order

   When you upgrade each node, upgrade existing packages in the following
   order:
     * On all operating systems except SUSE, upgrade the mapr-core package
       first. Subsequent packages can be done in any order.
     * On SUSE, upgrade the mapr-compat-suse package first and the
       mapr-core package second. Subsequent packages can be done in any
       order.

   The following is a list of the primary packages:
     * mapr-cldb
     * mapr-compat-suse (if upgrading on SUSE)
     * mapr-core-internal
     * mapr-core
     * mapr-fileserver
     * mapr-gateway
     * mapr-hadoop-core
     * mapr-historyserver
     * mapr-mapreduce2
     * mapr-nfs
     * mapr-nodemanager
     * mapr-resourcemanager
     * mapr-webserver
     * mapr-zk-internal
     * mapr-zookeeper
