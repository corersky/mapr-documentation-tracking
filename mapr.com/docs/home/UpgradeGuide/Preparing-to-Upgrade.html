Preparing to Upgrade MapR Core

   Complete these pre-upgrade steps for MapR Core.

   After you have planned your upgrade process, prepare the cluster for
   upgrade while your existing cluster is fully operational. Prepare to
   upgrade as described in this section to minimize downtime and eliminate
   unnecessary risk. Design and run health tests and back up critical
   data. Performing these tasks during upgrading reduces the number of
   times you have to touch each node, but increases down-time during
   upgrade. Upgrade a test cluster before upgrading your production
   cluster.

   Complete these pre-upgrade steps:

1. Verify System Requirements for All Nodes

   Verify that all nodes meet the following minimum requirements for the
   new version of MapR software:
     * Software dependencies. Package dependencies in the MapR
       distribution can change from version to version. If the new version
       of MapR has dependencies that were not present in the older
       version, you must address them on all nodes before upgrading MapR
       software. Installing dependency packages can be done while the
       cluster is operational. See [1]Packages and Dependencies for MapR
       Software. If you are using a package manager, you can specify a
       repository that contains the dependency package(s), and allow the
       package manager to automatically install them when you upgrade the
       MapR packages. If you are installing from package files, you must
       pre-install dependencies on all nodes manually.
     * Hardware requirements. The newer version of packages might have
       greater hardware requirements. [2]Hardware requirements must be met
       before upgrading.
     * OS requirements. MapR OS requirements do not change frequently. If
       the OS on a node doesn’t meet the requirements for the newer
       version of MapR, plan to decommission the node and re-deploy it
       with an updated OS after the upgrade. See [3]Operating System
       Support Matrix (MapR 6.x) and [4]Operating System Support Matrix
       (MapR 5.x).
     * Certificate requirements. Recent versions of [5]Safari and
       [6]Chrome web browsers have removed support for older certificate
       cipher algorithms, including those used by some versions of MapR.
       For more information on resolving this issue, see [7]Unable to
       Establish a Secure Connection.

2. Design Health Checks

   Plan what kind of test jobs and scripts you will use to verify cluster
   health as part of the upgrade process. You will verify cluster health
   several times before, during, and after upgrade to ensure success at
   every step, and to isolate issues whenever they occur. Create both
   simple tests to verify that cluster services start and respond, as well
   as non-trivial tests that verify workload-specific aspects of your
   cluster.

   Design Simple Tests

   Here are a few examples of simple tests you can design to check node
   health:
     * Use maprcli commands to see if any alerts exist and to verify that
       services are running as expected. For example:
# maprcli node list -columns svc
              service                                                     hostna
me  ip
              nodemanager,cldb,fileserver,hoststats                       centos
55  10.10.82.55
              nodemanager,fileserver,hoststats                            centos
56  10.10.82.56
              fileserver,nodemanager,hoststats                            centos
57  10.10.82.57
              fileserver,nodemanager,webserver,hoststats                  centos
58  10.10.82.58
              ...lines deleted...
              # maprcli alarm list
              alarm state  description
                                                entity    alarm name
                 alarm statechange time
              1            One or more licenses is about to expire within 25 day
s                                               CLUSTER   CLUSTER_ALARM_LICENSE_
NEAR_EXPIRATION  1366142919009
              1            Can not determine if service: nfs is running. Check l
ogs at: /opt/mapr/logs/nfsserver.log            centos58  NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_NFS
_DOWN            1366194786905
       In this example you can see that an alarm is raised indicating that
       MapR software expects an NFS server to be running on node centos58,
       and the node list of running services confirms that the nfs service
       is not running on this node.
     * Batch create a set of test files.
     * Submit a MapReduce application.
     * Run simple checks on installed Hadoop ecosystem components. For
       example, run a Hive query.

   Design Non-trivial Tests
   Appropriate non-trivial tests will be specific to your particular
   cluster’s workload. You may have to work with users to define an
   appropriate set of tests. Run tests on the existing cluster to
   calibrate expectations for “healthy” task and job durations. On future
   iterations of the tests, inspect results for deviations. Some examples:
     * Run performance benchmarks relevant to the cluster’s typical
       workload.
     * Run a suite of common jobs. Inspect for correct results and
       deviation from expected completion times.
     * Test correct inter-operation of all components in the Hadoop stack
       and third-party tools.
     * Confirm the integrity of critical data stored on the cluster.

3. Verify Cluster Health

   Run the test you designed in step 2 to verify the cluster health prior
   to upgrade.
     * Run the suite of simple tests to verify that basic features of the
       MapR Core are functioning correctly, and that any alarms are known
       and accounted for.
     * Run the suite of non-trivial tests to verify that the cluster is
       running as expected for a typical workload, including integration
       with Hadoop ecosystem components and third-party tools.

   Proceed with the upgrade only if the cluster is in an expected, healthy
   state.

4. Back Up Critical Data

   Data in the MapR cluster persists across upgrades from version to
   version. However, as a precaution you might want to back up critical
   data before upgrading. If you deem it practical and necessary, you can
   do any of the following:
     * Copy data out of the cluster using distcp to a separate, non-Hadoop
       datastore.
     * Mirror critical volume(s) into a separate MapR cluster, creating a
       read-only copy of the data which can be accessed via the other
       cluster.

   When services for the new version are activated, MapR-FS will update
   data on disk automatically. The migration is transparent to users and
   administrators. Once the cluster is active with the new version, you
   cannot roll back.

5. Run Your Upgrade Plan on a Test Cluster

   Before executing your upgrade plan on the production cluster, perform a
   complete dry run on a test cluster. You can perform the dry run on a
   smaller cluster than the production cluster, but make the dry run as
   similar to the real-world circumstances as possible. For example,
   install all Hadoop ecosystem components that are in use in production,
   and replicate data and jobs from the production cluster on the test
   cluster. The goals for the dry run are:
     * Eliminate surprises. Get familiar with all upgrade operations you
       will perform as you upgrade the production cluster.
     * Uncover any upgrade-related issues as early as possible so you can
       accommodate them in your upgrade plan. Look for issues in the
       upgrade process itself, as well as operational and integration
       issues that could arise after the upgrade.

6. Pause Cross-Cluster Operations

   Complete the steps for each cross-cluster feature used by this cluster:
     * Volume Mirroring. If volumes from another cluster are mirrored on
       this cluster, use one of the following options to stop the
       mirroring of volumes on this cluster:

   Using the MCS See [8]Stopping the Mirror.
   Using a maprcli command Run the maprcli volume mirror stop command on
   this cluster. See [9]volume mirror stop.
     * Table Replication. If source tables on this cluster are replicated
       to tables on another cluster, pause the replication of tables on
       this cluster. Use one of the following options for each source
       table on this cluster:

   Using the MCS
         1. Log in to MCS and go to the source [10]table information page.
         2. On the Replications tab associated with the source table,
            select each replica and then click Actions > Pause Replication
            > .

   Using a maprcli command Run the maprcli table replica pause command.
   See [11]table replica pause.

   Note: Once you have completed the MapR Core upgade and the
   [12]Post-Upgrade Steps for MapR Core, you can resume cross-cluster
   operations.

7. Back up Configuration Files

   If you are upgrading the MapR FUSE-based POSIX client on Ubuntu, create
   a backup copy of your custom settings in the fuse.conf file in
   /opt/mapr/conf directory. If you do not create a backup copy, you may
   lose your custom settings for the POSIX client because the new
   fuse.conf file with default settings will overwrite your current
   fuse.conf file with custom settings. If you are upgrading the MapR
   FUSE-based POSIX client on other supported operating systems, during
   upgrade, MapR automatically sets up the fuse.conf.backup file in
   addition to the new fuse.conf file in the /opt/mapr/conf directory.

   Consider creating the env_override.sh file to store custom settings for
   environmental variables. Upgrading to a new MapR release causes the
   env.sh file to be replaced and removes any custom settings. Creating
   the env_override.sh file can simplify the management of environmental
   variables easier. For more information, see [13]About env_override.sh.

8. Migrate from MapReduce Version 1

   MapReduce version 1 (MRv1) is deprecated for MapR 6.0 or later. If you
   were previously using MRv1, you must prepare your cluster to run
   MapReduce version 2 (MRv2) applications before upgrading to MapR 6.0 or
   later:
     * Ensure that the MapReduce mode on your cluster is set to yarn. MRv2
       is an application that runs on top of YARN.
     * Uninstall all packages associated with MRv1.

   For more information about how to prepare your cluster to run MRv2
   applications, see [14]Migrating from MapReduce Version 1 to MapReduce
   Version 2.

9. Migrate from Apache HBase

   Apache HBase is deprecated for MapR 6.0 or later. If you were
   previously using Apache HBase tables, prepare your cluster to use
   MapR-DB binary tables:
     * Run the following command on all nodes that contain HBase or
       AsyncHBase to ensure that your nodes are configured to connect to
       MapR-DB binary tables instead of Apache HBase tables:
configure.sh -R -defaultdb maprdb
       This command also configures AsyncHBase to access MapR-DB binary
       tables instead of Apache HBase tables.
     * If you would like to migrate data from Apache HBase tables to
       MapR-DB binary tables, you must do so before upgrading to MapR 6.0
       or later. For more information on how to migrate your data, see
       [15]Migrating between Apache HBase and MapR-DB Binary Tables.

10. Migrate from Mahout and Storm

   Mahout and Storm are not supported on MapR 6.0 or later. Before the
   upgrade, disable applications that use these components, and remove the
   Mahout and Storm packages.

11. Prepare to Upgrade the Expansion Pack

   Complete the pre-upgrade steps in [16]Preparing to Upgrade the
   Expansion Pack. Then return to this section.
