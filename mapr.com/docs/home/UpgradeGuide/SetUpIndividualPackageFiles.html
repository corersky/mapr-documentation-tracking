Set Up Individual Package Files

   This section describes how to upgrade MapR software using individual
   package files.

   You can download package files, store them locally, and then install
   MapR from the files. This option is typically used to upgrade clusters
   that are not connected to the internet.

   Platform-specific upgrade repositories are hosted at:
   [1]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v<version>/<platform>/mapr-v<versio
   n>GA-upgrade.<rpm/deb>.tgz.

   See [2]MapR Repositories and Packages for more information about
   repositories and packages.

   To upgrade MapR using individual package files, you need to first
   pre-install the MapR package dependencies on each node. See the
   [3]Release Notes for the dependency packages required for the MapR
   services that you are installing. Manually download the packages and
   install them.
    1. Using a machine connected to the internet, download the tarball for
       the MapR components and the Hadoop ecosystem components,
       substituting the appropriate <platform>, <version>, and
       <datestamp>.
       For example:
       http://package.mapr.com/releases/v<version>/ubunto/mapr-v<version>G
       A-upgrade.deb.tgz
    2. Extract the tarball to a local directory, either on each node or on
       a local network accessible by all nodes.
tar -xvzf <product_package>.tgz
