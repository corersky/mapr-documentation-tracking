Preparing to Upgrade the MapR Ecosystem Pack

   Complete these pre-upgrade steps for each ecosystem component in the
   MEP that you want to upgrade.

   For the components provided in each MEP, see the [1]MEP Release Notes.

   These steps are intended primarily for ecosystem-component upgrades
   performed manually (without the MapR Installer). However, you need to
   perform some pre-upgrade steps even if you are upgrading using the MapR
   Installer.

   Stopping each service is optional if you are using the MapR Installer
   because the Installer stops all services before upgrading. But the MapR
   Installer does NOT back up configuration files.
   Important: Regardless of the upgrade method that you use, follow the
   pre-upgrade steps for backing up your configuration files before
   upgrading. The upgrade process replaces your current configuration
   files with new configuration files that contain default values for the
   release to which are upgrading. Any custom settings are lost and must
   be migrated manually as part of the post-upgrade steps.
