Post-Upgrade Steps for Sentry

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Sentry with or without
   the MapR Installer.
   If you saved the configuration files from the previous installation of
   Sentry, you can migrate the saved settings into the new default files.
   Use the schema tool to upgrade the database schema and then start the
   Sentry service.
    1. (Optional) Migrate the settings in the saved configuration files
       from the previous version of Sentry into the new default files in
       /opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<version>/conf/.
    2. To upgrade the database schema using the schema tool, issue the
       following command:
/opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<SENTRY_VERSION>/bin/sentry --command schema-tool --conf
file <sentry-site.xml> --dbType <db-type> --upgradeSchema
    3. To start the Sentry service, issue one of the following commands
          + If the warden.sentry.conf exists in the /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/
            directory:
maprcli node services -name sentry  -action start -nodes <list of Sentry service
 nodes>
          + If the warden.sentry.conf does not exist in the
            /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/ directory:
/opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<SENTRY_VERSION>/bin/sentry-daemon.sh  start <sentry-sit
e.xml>
