Updating the MapR Installer

   Update the MapR Installer to include the latest MapR ecosystem packages
   and installer fixes. Once you update the MapR Installer, you can
   install ecosystem components and MapR versions that were made available
   after you first configured the MapR Installer.

   To check the version of the MapR Installer, see [1]Checking the MapR
   Installer Version.

Upgrades from MapR Installer 1.5 to 1.6 or Later

   If you upgrade from MapR Installer 1.5 to 1.6 or later, it is important
   to know if your cluster uses two-digit or three-digit MEPs. Some MapR
   Installer 1.6 or later features, such as Extend Cluster, require you to
   use three-digit MEPs. If you want to use the Extend Cluster feature,
   you must perform an Incremental Install to change the MEP selection for
   your cluster. For more information, see [2]Understanding Two-Digit and
   Three-Digit MEPs.

Update the MapR Installer using an Internet Repository

   If the node that runs the MapR Installer uses an Internet repository
   that points to package.mapr.com, use one of the following methods to
   gain access to the latest packages:
     * Run the following command:
bash /opt/mapr/installer/bin/mapr-setup.sh
     * Use a package manager to update the packages:

        On CentOS/RedHat

yum update mapr-installer mapr-installer-definitions

        On Ubuntu

apt-get install mapr-installer mapr-installer-definitions

        On SUSE

zypper update mapr-installer mapr-installer-definitions

   Note: If you are currently running the MapR Installer Version
   1.0.201505130546, you must re-run the mapr-setup.sh script after you
   use the package manager to update the packages.

   Once the update is complete, open the MapR Installer URL
   (https://<hostname/IPaddress>:9443) to update the cluster.

Update the MapR Installer using a Local Repository

   If the node that runs the MapR Installer uses a local repository,
   perform the following steps to manually get the latest packages for the
   MapR cluster version that you are updating or upgrading to:
    1. Download the latest versions of the following archive files.

   For MapR 5.2 and above
          + The MapR Core archive file. Download the MapR archive file
            mapr-<version>GA.<dep|rpm>.tgz from one of the following
            locations, based on the operating system of the node:
               o [3]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v.<version>/redhat/
               o [4]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v.<version>/ubuntu/
            Note: The package mapr-v<version>GA-upgrade.<rpm/deb>.tgz is
            not for use with the MapR Installer.
          + The MapR Installer archive file. Based on the operating system
            of the node, download
            mapr-installer-<version>.<yyyymmdd>.<dep|rpm>.tgz from one of
            the following locations:
               o [5]http://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/redhat
               o [6]http://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/ubuntu
          + The MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) archive file. Based on the
            operating system of the node, download
            mapr-mep-<version>.<yyyymmdd>.<dep|rpm>.tgz from one of the
            following locations:
               o [7]http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/red
                 hat
               o [8]http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/ubu
                 ntu

          + [10]http://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/redhat/

    2. Run the following command:
bash /opt/mapr/installer/bin/mapr-setup.sh -a <full path to each archive
    file>
    3. Once the update is complete, open the MapR Installer URL
       (https://<hostname/IPaddress>:9443) to update the cluster.
