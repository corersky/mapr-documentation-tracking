Step 6: Update Hadoop Configuration File

   When manually upgrading (manual offline and manual rolling upgrade)
   from version 4.x to version 6.x and switching from classic mode to YARN
   mode, you must manually update the Hadoop configuration file.

   This task is applicable only if you are upgrading from any version of
   4.x to any version of 6.x and you did not convert from classic mode to
   YARN mode before the upgrade. In addition, this step is applicable for
   only the manual offline upgrade and the manual rolling upgrade. This
   step is not applicable when using the MapR Installer upgrade method.
    1. Change directory to /opt/mapr/conf directory.
cd /opt/mapr/conf/
    2. Edit the Hadoop configuration file
vim hadoop_version
    3. Change the yarn_version parameter to the actual version of Hadoop.
       For example:
yarn_version=2.7.0
