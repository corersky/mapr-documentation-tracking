Set Up the Local Repository: Ubuntu

   To create a local repository, download your files from the Internet and
   then add the repositories to each node in the cluster.

   You create a local repository from files that you download from the
   internet, and then add the repositories to each node in the cluster.
   The files that you download differ from version to version. See the
   [1]Packages and Dependencies for MapR Software for the URLs for all
   versions.
    1. Login as root on the machine where you will set up the repository.
    2. Change to the directory /root and create the following directories
       within it:
       [directory_structure.png]
    3. On a computer that is connected to the Internet, download the
       following files, substituting the appropriate <version> and
       <datestamp>.
       For example:
https://package.mapr.com/releases/v<version>/ubuntu/mapr-v<version>GA-upgrade.de
b.tgz
    4. Copy the files to /root/mapr/mapr on the node, and extract them
       there.
       For example:
tar -xvzf <product_package>.deb.tgz
    5. Navigate to the /root/mapr/ directory.
    6. Use dpkg-scanpackages to create Packages.gz in the binary-amd64
       directory.
dpkg-scanpackages . /dev/null | gzip -9c > ./dists/binary/optional/binary-amd64/
Packages.gz
    7. Move the entire /root/mapr directory to the default directory
       served by the HTTP server (for example, /var/www) and make sure the
       HTTP server is running.
    8. Add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list on each node,
       replacing <host> with the IP address or hostname of the node where
       you created the repository.
       deb http://<host</mapr binary optional
    9. On each node update the package indexes (as root or with sudo).
       apt-get update
   10. Use apt-get to install MapR software and Hadoop ecosystem
       components from the local repository on each node.
