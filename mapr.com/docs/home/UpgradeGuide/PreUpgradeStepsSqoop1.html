Pre-Upgrade Steps for Sqoop1

   Complete the following steps before you upgrade Sqoop1 with or without
   the MapR Installer.

   You need to back up configuration files for Sqoop1 if you made
   configuration changes that you want to carry over to the next version.
    1. Locate the files in the /opt/mapr/sqoop/sqoop-<version>/conf/
       directory.
    2. Copy configuration files to a location outside the MapR
       installation.
       For example, you can copy the file to a /tmp directory:
cp /opt/mapr/sqoop/sqoop-<version>/server/conf/sqoop.properties /tmp/
       After upgrading, you can reapply changes to the updated Sqoop1
       using the backup.
