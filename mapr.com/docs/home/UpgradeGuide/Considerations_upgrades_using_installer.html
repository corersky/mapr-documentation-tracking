Considerations for Upgrades Using the MapR Installer

   If you use the MapR Installer to upgrade the cluster, some post-upgrade
   steps for MapR Core do not need to be performed. This page describes
   the post-upgrade steps that are performed by the MapR Installer and the
   steps that you must perform manually.

   This information is relevant to the [1]workflow for MapR Installer
   upgrades. The information on this page also applies to upgrades
   performed using MapR Installer Stanzas.
   Post-Upgrade Step for MapR Core Performed by MapR Installer? Notes
   [2]Step 1: Restart and Check Cluster Services Yes, with exceptions. See
   the notes. Usually, you do not need to perform this step. When you use
   the MapR Installer to upgrade, the Installer runs configure.sh on each
   node, starts ZooKeeper and Warden, and sets the new cluster version. If
   the [3]env_override.sh file is present, the Installer uses environment
   variables from the env_override.sh file.

   If you use the MapR Installer to upgrade, you need to perform this step
   manually only if you make significant changes to configuration files
   after the upgrade (see [4]Step 2: Manually Update Configuration Files).
   [5]Step 2: Manually Update Configuration Files No You might need to
   perform this step. The MapR Installer uses default configuration-file
   settings and does NOT update configuration files. You must perform this
   step after upgrading using the MapR Installer only if you have made
   configuration-file customizations that you want to migrate to the
   upgraded cluster. Depending on the customization, you might also need
   to restart services or even the full cluster after updating
   configuration files.
   [6]Step 3: Manually Update your License No You might need to perform
   this step. If you are upgrading from MapR 5.0 or earlier, the Base
   License file must be updated manually. The MapR Installer does not
   update the Base License file.
   [7]Step 4: Enable New Features Yes You do not need to perform this
   step. The MapR Installer enables new features as part of a version
   upgrade.
   [8]Step 5: Update Hadoop Configuration File Yes You do not need to
   perform this step. The MapR Installer updates the Hadoop configuration
   file, if necessary, as part of a version upgrade.
