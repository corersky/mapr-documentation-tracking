Upgrading MapR Core Without the MapR Installer

   You can upgrade MapR Core without using the MapR Installer.

   First, you perform an offline or rolling upgrade of the MapR core
   manually. Next, you configure the new version to enable support of MapR
   core features. Finally, you upgrade ecosystem components manually.
   When upgrading, you can install packages from the following sources:
     * The MapR internet repository
     * A local repository
     * Individual package files

   Go to the next topic to begin setting up repositories.
   When you are finished upgrading MapR core, you will need to follow the
   steps to upgrade the ecosystem components, as described in [1]Upgrading
   the MapR Ecosystem Pack Without the MapR Installer.
   Note: MapR 6.0 and later releases are only compatible with MEP 4.0.0
   and later MEPs (see [2]MEP Support by MapR Core Version). If you
   upgrade MapR Core to MapR 6.0 or later, you must install or upgrade to
   MEP 4.0.0 or later. Clusters with MEP 3.0.1 or later are allowed to
   upgrade to MapR 6.0 or later, but such clusters must not enable new
   features, add new services, add new nodes, or make configuration
   changes until MEP 3.0.1 or later is upgraded to MEP 4.0.0 or later.

   Then proceed to [3]Finishing the MapR Core Upgrade.
