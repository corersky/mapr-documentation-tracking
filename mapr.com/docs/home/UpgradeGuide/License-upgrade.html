Upgrading and Your License

   If you are upgrading from MapR version 5.0 or earlier, the Base License
   file must be manually updated on all nodes in your cluster.
   Important: As of MapR version 5.1, because of the new license
   categories, you must manually update the Base License file. This
   applies to all upgrade methods (MapR Installer, MapR Installer Stanzas,
   or manual rolling upgrade).

   To update the Base License file, copy the new Base License file from
   the /opt/mapr/conf.new/ directory to the /opt/mapr/conf/ directory on
   every node in your cluster.
cp /opt/mapr/conf.new/BaseLicense.txt /opt/mapr/conf/

   Note: The BaseLicense.txt file must be copied before starting Warden;
   otherwise, Warden must be restarted.

MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Module

   If you are upgrading from the Enterprise Database Edition (M7) to the
   Enterprise Edition and want to use the MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka module, you must purchase additional licensing. In this case, you
   will be issued a new license to apply. See [1]Managing Licenses for
   more information.

License Editions

   As of MapR 5.1, MapR licenses are categorized by new editions and
   modules that further define the features supported by an edition. See
   the following table for descriptions of the new license options:
   License Edition Description
   Community Edition An unlimited, free, community-supported MapR edition
   with one free NFS Gateway. This edition includes Hadoop, MapR Database,
   and MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka. However, real-time global
   replication of MapR Database tables or MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka is not included.
   Enterprise Edition MapR Edition that enables enterprise class features
   such as high availability, multi-tenancy, and disaster recovery. Each
   of the following modules for the Enterprise Edition unlocks a portion
   of the total platform capabilities:

   Analytics

          as highly-available NFS and support for services such as YARN
          and MapReduce.

          database, with MapR Database JSON and binary tables, and
          real-time global database replication.

          streaming, with MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka and real-time
          global stream replication.

License Mapping

   With the release of 5.1 and MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka, the
   licensing model has been simplified, allowing more choice in which
   specific features are licensed on a cluster. See the following table to
   understand how the new MapR licenses correspond to the legacy license
   editions that you are familiar with:
   Legacy Edition New Edition & Module(s)
   M3 or Community Edition Community Edition. Starting in 5.1, the
   Community Edition includes MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka.
   M5 or Enterprise Edition Enterprise Edition with Hadoop Module.
   M7 or Enterprise Database Edition Enterprise Edition with Hadoop and
   Database modules.

MapR Metering Feature

   Beginning with the MapR 6.1 release, MapR software supports metering.
   Annual subscriptions will continue to be offered, but metering gives
   you the option of purchasing a variable consumption plan that is based
   on usage.

   For more information, see [3]MapR Software Licensing.

MapR POSIX Licenses

   Beginning with MapR 6.0.1, customers who purchase MapR-XD Enterprise
   Premier automatically receive the following licenses for free:
     * MapR FUSE POSIX Basic Client
     * MapR POSIX Client for Containerized Apps (required for MapR PACC
       and DSR functionality)
