Planning Your MapR Core Upgrade

   This section describes how to develop a successful plan for your
   upgrade process.

   The key to a successful upgrade process is to plan the process ahead of
   time. This page helps you develop an upgrade process that fits the
   needs of your cluster and users.

Choosing a Cluster Upgrade Method

   Supported upgrade methods are:
     * Manual rolling upgrade
     * Offline manual upgrade
     * Offline upgrade using the MapR Installer

   [1]Upgrade Workflows describe these methods in more detail. The method
   you choose affects the flow of events while upgrading packages on nodes
   and the duration of the maintenance window.
   The following table summarizes the MapR Core upgrade paths supported
   for each method:
   Upgrade From Upgrade To Offline Rolling
   3.x          6.1.0      Yes     No
   4.x          6.1.0      Yes     No*
   5.x          6.1.0      Yes     Yes**
   6.x          6.1.0      Yes     Yes

   *Rolling upgrades from 4.x to 5.x are supported, after which you may
   perform another rolling upgrade from 5.x to 6.x.

   **MapR Core by itself supports rolling upgrades from MapR 5.x to later
   releases. If your cluster includes MapR Core and MapR ecosystem
   components, rolling upgrades to MapR 6.x are supported only from MapR
   5.2.x and MEP 3.0.1 or later. Ecosystem components will continue to
   work during a rolling upgrade of MapR Core as long as the ecosystem
   components are not updated. But the rolling upgrade of ecosystem
   components is not supported. If you choose to upgrade MapR Core and
   ecosystem components together, the ecosystem components might not
   function properly during the upgrade process.
   The following table summarizes upgrade support for MapR Expansion Packs
   (MEPs):
   Upgrade From Upgrade To Offline Rolling
   Pre-MEP      MEP 6.0.0  Yes     No
   MEP 1.1.x    MEP 6.0.0  Yes     No
   MEP 2.x      MEP 6.0.0  Yes     No
   MEP 3.0.1+   MEP 6.0.0  Yes     Yes*
   MEP 4.x      MEP 6.0.0  Yes     Yes*
   MEP 5.x      MEP 6.0.0  Yes     Yes*

   *A rolling upgrade of MapR Core is supported, and ecosystem components
   will continue to work during the rolling upgrade, but a rolling upgrade
   of ecosystem components is not supported.

Transition MEPs

   The following MEPs are considered transition MEPs because you can
   upgrade these MEPs directly to MapR 6.1.0 using a rolling upgrade (for
   components that support a rolling upgrade):
     * MEP 3.0.1 and later 3.0.x
     * MEP 4.x
     * MEP 5.x

   Transition MEPs can coexist with MapR 6.1.0 only during the course of
   an upgrade. You must not enable MapR 6.1.0 new features while a
   transition MEP is in use on MapR 6.1.0. You must upgrade to MEP 6.0.0
   before enabling new features for MapR 6.1.0.

Offline Upgrade

   The offline upgrade process is simpler than a rolling upgrade, and
   usually completes faster. In an offline upgrade, MapR processes and the
   jobs that depend on them are stopped on all nodes so that packages can
   be updated. Offline upgrade is the default upgrade method when other
   methods cannot be used.
   Offline Upgrade Paths without the MapR Installer

   You can perform an offline upgrade from the following MapR versions:
     * 3.x
     * 4.0.x
     * 4.1
     * 5.x
     * 6.x

   Note: After upgrading MapR Core to MapR 6.0 or later, you must upgrade
   ecosystem components to a MEP that is compatible with your MapR 6.0 or
   later release. To determine the compatible MEPs, see [2]MEP Support by
   MapR Core Version. This must be done before you enable MapR 6.0 or
   later features.
   During the maintenance window, the administrator:
     * Stops all jobs on the cluster.
     * Stops all cluster services.
     * Upgrades packages on all nodes (which can be done in parallel).
     * Brings the cluster back online at once.

   Offline Upgrade Path with the MapR Installer
   You can perform an offline upgrade by using the MapR Installer or MapR
   Installer Stanzas. Note these restrictions:
     * Before performing the upgrade, you must update the MapR Installer
       to version 1.7 or later.
     * Upgrades using the MapR Installer are supported only from MapR
       5.2.x with MEP 3.0.1 or later.
     * The following table summarizes how the MapR Installer handles
       security during an upgrade to MapR 6.1.0:

   Upgrading From Security Setting MapR Installer Behavior
   MapR 5.2.x On This is a [3]custom security scenario. You cannot use the
   MapR Installer or Stanzas to perform the upgrade. You must upgrade
   manually.
   MapR 5.2.x Off The MapR Installer does not add security by default
   during an upgrade. After the upgrade to MapR 6.1.0, you can turn on
   security by using the [4]incremental install function.
   MapR 6.0 or 6.0.1 On The MapR Installer leaves the current security
   settings intact, resulting in a secure MapR 6.1.0 cluster. This upgrade
   assumes that no custom security settings are implemented. You must
   upgrade manually if custom security settings are implemented.
   MapR 6.0 or 6.0.1 Off The MapR Installer does not add security by
   default during an upgrade. After the upgrade to MapR 6.1.0, you can
   turn on security by using the [5]incremental install function.

   Note: When upgrading to MapR 6.0 or later using the MapR Installer or
   Stanzas, MEP 3.0.1 or later is upgraded automatically to MEP 4.0.0 or
   later. MEP 3.0.1 or later is supported on MapR 6.0 or later only for
   upgrade purposes.

Rolling Upgrade

   In a manual rolling upgrade, you upgrade the MapR software one node at
   a time so that the cluster as a whole remains operational throughout
   the process. The fileserver service on each node goes offline while
   packages are upgraded, but its absence is short enough that the cluster
   does not raise the data-under-replication alarm.

   The following restrictions apply to rolling upgrades:
     * In MapR 6.0 and later, only manual rolling upgrades are supported.
       Scripted rolling upgrades are not supported.
     * Rolling upgrades only upgrade MapR Core packages, not ecosystem
       components. A rolling upgrade of ecosystem components is not
       supported.
     * If you choose to do a rolling upgrade on a cluster with MapR Core
       and MapR ecosystem components, the ecosystem components will
       continue to work during the rolling upgrade as long as the
       ecosystem components are not updated. If you choose to upgrade MapR
       Core and ecosystem components together, the ecosystem components
       might not function properly during the upgrade process.
     * The administrator should block off a maintenance window, during
       which only critical jobs are allowed to run and users expect
       longer-than-average run times.

   Rolling Upgrade Paths

   You can perform a manual rolling upgrade from only the following MapR
   versions:
     * 5.2.x with MEP 3.0.1 or later
     * 6.x with MEP 4.0.0 or later

   Note: After upgrading MapR Core, you must upgrade ecosystem components
   to MEP 4.0.0 or later, and this must be done before you enable MapR 6.0
   or later features. To determine the MEP required by your MapR release,
   see [6]MEP Support by MapR Core Version.

Updating the JDK

   Check the JDK Support Matrix to verify that your JDK version is
   supported by the MapR version to which you are upgrading. MapR 6.0 or
   later requires JDK 8. See the [7]JDK Support Matrix for more
   information.

Planning for Security

   Security is not enabled by default for upgrades. During an upgrade, the
   security attributes of your cluster are preserved unless you decide to
   change them. Note that if you have configured security on your cluster,
   you cannot use the MapR Installer or Stanzas to upgrade. You must
   upgrade manually. For information about custom security, see
   [8]Customizing Security in MapR.

   Before upgrading MapR software, make sure that you have reviewed the
   list of known vulnerabilities in [9]Security Vulnerabilities. If a
   vulnerability applies to your release, contact your MapR support
   representative for a fix, and apply the fix immediately, if applicable.

Scheduling the Upgrade

   Consider the following factors when scheduling the upgrade:
     * When will preparation steps be performed? How much of the process
       can be performed before the maintenance window?
     * What calendar time would minimize disruption in terms of workload,
       access to data, and other stakeholder needs?
     * How many nodes need to be upgraded? How long will the upgrade
       process take for each node, and for the cluster as a whole?
     * When should the cluster stop accepting new non-critical jobs?
     * When (or will) existing jobs be terminated?
     * How long will it take to clear the pipeline of current workload?
     * Will other Hadoop ecosystem components (such as Hive) get upgraded
       during the same maintenance window?
     * When and how will stakeholders be notified?

Planning Upgrades to MapR Clients

   Determine if you need to upgrade MapR client nodes. You upgrade MapR
   client nodes after you upgrade the MapR cluster nodes.

   MapR Client Nodes

   On each MapR client node, upgrade to the client version that is
   compatible with the operations that you want to perform on the cluster.
   The following table shows which supported client operations are
   available based on the client version and the cluster version.
   The following client operations are supported on 4.0.x and 5.x clusters
   and clients.
     * File system access
     * Submit MapReduce (MR) v1 job
     * Submit MapReduce v2 applications

   The following client operation is supported on 4.0.2 and higher
   clusters with 4.0.2 and higher clients. For example, this operation is
   not available on a 5.1 cluster with a 4.0.1 client.
     * Submit MapReduce version 2 applications with Resource Manager
       zero-configuration failover

   MapR POSIX Client Nodes

   On MapR POSIX client nodes, the only supported client operation is file
   system access. As of 5.1, MapR FUSE-based POSIX clients are available,
   in addition to MapR loopback NFS clients.
   Note: Only MapR clusters version 5.1 or higher support MapR FUSE-based
   POSIX clients.

   MapR POSIX loopback NFS clients can be upgraded or a fresh install can
   be performed. Additionally, MapR POSIX loopback NFS clients can be
   migrated to a FUSE-based POSIX Basic client. MapR POSIX loopback NFS
   clients can not be migrated to FUSE-based Platinum POSIX clients.

   See [10]Upgrading the MapR POSIX loopbacknfs Client and [11]Migrating
   to FUSE-based POSIX Clients for more information.
   Note: Basic and Platinum POSIX client packages are recommended for
   fresh installation and for all new clusters.

   Upgrade to the client version supported by your cluster, as shown in
   the following table. Upgrading to the 5.x client is recommended for 4.1
   and 5.x clusters of MapR loopbacknfs POSIX nodes. If you plan on using
   FUSE-based POSIX clients, ensure that the cluster has been upgraded to
   MapR 5.1 or higher because the FUSE-based POSIX client can only connect
   to clusters running MapR v5.1 or higher.

   The following table shows which MapR loopback NFS client versions are
   supported by which MapR clusters. For example, the MapR 6.0 cluster
   supports 4.0.2, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2 Mapr loopback NFS clients.

   CAPTION: Table 1. MapR loopback NFS POSIX Client Upgrades

     6.x client 5.2 client 5.1 client 5.0 client 4.1 client 4.0.2 client
   4.0.1 client
   6.x cluster Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes N/A
   5.2 cluster Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes N/A
   5.1 cluster Yes Yes Yes (recommended) Yes Yes Yes N/A
   5.0 cluster Yes Yes Yes (recommended) Yes Yes Yes N/A
   4.1 cluster Yes Yes Yes (recommended) Yes Yes Yes N/A
   4.0.2 cluster Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes N/A

Determining Cross-Cluster Feature Support

   MapR supports features that operate on more than one cluster. Before
   you upgrade, consider the impact of the following cross-cluster
   features:

   Volume Mirroring
          Volume mirroring from a lower MapR version to higher MapR
          version is supported. For example, you can mirror volumes from a
          MapR 4.0.1 cluster to a MapR 5.2 cluster. However, mirroring
          from higher version in source cluster to a lower version in
          destination cluster is supported only if new features are not
          enabled in the source cluster. For example, you can mirror
          volumes from a MapR 6.0 cluster to a MapR 5.1 cluster (only) if
          new features since MapR 5.1 are not enabled in the MapR 6.0
          cluster.

   Table Replication
          Table replication works between clusters of different versions
          as long as both versions support MapR Database table
          replication. For example, you can replicate MapR Database binary
          tables from a MapR 5.1 cluster to a MapR 4.1 cluster.

          Note: As of MapR 5.2, MapR Database JSON table replication is
          also supported. You cannot replicate MapR Database JSON tables
          to cluster that runs a version prior to 5.2.
