Post-Upgrade Steps for HttpFS

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade HttpFS with or without
   the MapR Installer.
    1. Migrate any custom HttpFS configuration settings into the new
       default files.
       For example, update the following files:
          + /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/webapps
            /webhdfs/WEB-INF/web.xml
          + /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/se
            rver.xm
          + /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/to
            mcat-users.xml
          + /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/etc/hadoop/httpfs-site.xml
    2. For mapr-httpfs included in MEP 4.0.0 or later, run the
       configure.sh script after making configure changes:
sudo bash /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
