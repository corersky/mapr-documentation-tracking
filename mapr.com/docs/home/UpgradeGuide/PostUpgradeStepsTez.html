Post-Upgrade Steps for Tez

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Tez with or without the
   MapR Installer.
    1. (Optional) Migrate any custom configuration settings into the new
       default files in the /opt/mapr/tez/tez-<old version>/conf/
       directory.
    2. If you are using the MapR Installer, no additional steps are
       required. For manual installation, you need to configure Hive 2.1
       and Tez 0.8. For configuration information, see [1]Configuring Hive
       2.1 and Tez 0.8.
