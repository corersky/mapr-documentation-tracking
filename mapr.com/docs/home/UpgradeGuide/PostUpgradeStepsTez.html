Post-Upgrade Steps for Tez

   Complete the following steps after you upgrade Tez with or without the
   MapR Installer.
   After a minor version update, for example from Tez-0.9-1808 to
   Tez-0.9-1901, no changes to the user configuration, tez-site.xml file,
   is applied. To manually apply the latest changes, see [1]Tez Release
   Notes.
    1. (Optional) Migrate any custom configuration settings into the new
       default files in the /opt/mapr/tez/tez-<old version>/conf/
       directory.
    2. If you are using the MapR Installer, no additional steps are
       required. For manual installation, you need to configure Hive 2.3
       and Tez 0.9. For configuration information, see [2]Configuring Hive
       2.3 and Tez 0.9.
