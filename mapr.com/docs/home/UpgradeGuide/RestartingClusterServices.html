Step 1: Restart and Check Cluster Services

   After upgrading MapR Core using either a manual offline or rolling
   upgrade method (not upgrading with the MapR Installer) and upgrading
   your ecosystem components, configure and restart the cluster and
   services.
   Note: This task is applicable only to manual offline and rolling
   upgrade methods.
   Important: Before restarting cluster services, upgrade any existing
   ecosystem packages to versions compatible with the upgraded MapR
   release. For more information, see [1]MEP Components and OS Support.

   This procedure configures and restarts the cluster and services,
   including ecosystem components, remounts the NFS share, and checks that
   all packages have been upgraded on all nodes.

   After finishing this procedure, run non-trivial health checks, such as
   performance benchmarks relevant the clusterâ€™s typical workload or a
   suite of common jobs. It is a good idea to run these types of checks
   when the cluster is idle. In this procedure, you configure each node in
   the cluster without changing the list of services that will run on the
   node. If you want to change the list of services, do so after
   completing the upgrade. After you have upgraded packages on all nodes,
   perform this procedure on all nodes to restart the cluster. Upon
   completion of this procedure MapR core services are running on all
   nodes.
    1. Merge any custom edits that you made to your cluster's environment
       variables into the new /opt/mapr/conf/env_override.sh file before
       restarting the cluster. This is because the upgrade process
       replaces your original /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh file with a new copy
       of env.sh that is appropriate for the MapR version to which you are
       upgrading. The new env.sh does not include any custom edits you
       might have made to the original env.sh. However, a backup of your
       original env.sh file is saved as /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh<timestamp>.
       Before restarting the cluster, you must add any custom entries from
       /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh<timestamp> into
       /opt/mapr/conf/env_override.sh, and copy the updated
       env_override.sh to all other nodes in the cluster. See [2]About
       env_override.sh.
    2. On each node in the cluster, run [3]configure.sh with the -R option
       # /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
    3. If ZooKeeper is installed on the node, start it.
       # service mapr-zookeeper start
    4. Start Warden.
       # service mapr-warden start
    5. Run a simple health-check targeting the file system and MapReduce
       services only. Address any issues or alerts that might have come up
       at this point.
    6. Set the new cluster version in the /opt/mapr/MapRBuildVersion file
       by running the following command on any node in the cluster.
       # maprcli config save -values {mapr.targetversion:"`cat
       /opt/mapr/MapRBuildVersion`"}
    7. Verify the new cluster version.
       For example:
# maprcli config load -keys mapr.targetversion
mapr.targetversion
6.0.0.xxxxx.GA
    8. Remount the MapR NFS share.
       The following example assumes that the cluster is mounted at /mapr:
       # mount -o hard,nolock <hostname>:/mapr /mapr
    9. Run commands, as shown in the example, to check that the packages
       have been upgraded successfully.
       Check the following things:
          + All expected nodes show up in a cluster node list, and the
            expected services are configured on each node.
          + A master CLDB is active, and all nodes return the same result.
          + Only one ZooKeeper service claims to be the ZooKeeper leader,
            and all other ZooKeepers are followers.
       For example:
# maprcli node list -columns hostname,csvc
hostname configuredservice ip
centos55 nodemanager,cldb,fileserver,hoststats 10.10.82.55
centos56 nodemanager,cldb,fileserver,hoststats 10.10.82.56
centos57 fileserver,nodemanager,hoststats,resourcemanager 10.10.82.57
centos58 fileserver,nodemanager,webserver,nfs,hoststats,resourcemanager 10.10.82
.58
...more nodes...

# maprcli node cldbmaster
cldbmaster
ServerID: 8851109109619685455 HostName: centos56

# service mapr-zookeeper qstatus
JMX enabled by default
Using config: /opt/mapr/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.5/conf/zoo.cfg
Mode: follower
