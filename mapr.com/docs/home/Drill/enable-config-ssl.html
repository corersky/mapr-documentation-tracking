Configuring SSL/TLS

   Enable SSL in <DRILL_INSTALL_HOME>/conf/drill-override.conf. You can
   use several configuration options to customize SSL/TLS.
   You must restart the Drillbit process on each node after you modify the
   configuration options, as shown:
$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <node host names
 separated by a space>

   The following sections provide information and instructions for
   enabling and configuring SSL:

Enabling SSL

   When SSL is enabled, all Drill clients, such as JDBC and ODBC, must
   connect to Drill servers using SSL. Enable SSL in the Drill startup
   configuration file, drill-override.conf, located in
   /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf.

   To enable SSL for Drill, set the
   drill.exec.security.user.encryption.ssl.enabled option in
   drill-override.conf to "true."

Configuring SSL

   You can customize SSL on a Drillbit through the SSL configuration
   options. You can set the options from the command-line (using Java
   system properties), in the drill-override.conf file, or in the property
   file to which the Hadoop parameter hadoop.ssl.server.conf points
   (recommended).
   Note: Specifying values in drill-override.conf can expose the security
   parameters to end users. Administrators should set these values in the
   Hadoop security file and restrict permissions on that file.

   If a parameter is specified in multiple places, the value in the Hadoop
   configuration takes precedence over the Drill configuration, which
   takes precedence over the system property.
   The Hadoop configuration is specified in the file pointed to by the
   hadoop.ssl.server.conf parameter in the Hadoop core-site.xml file.
   Typically, this parameter points to $HADOOP_CONF/ssl-server.xml, which
   contains the property names to configure SSL. Both the core-site.xml
   file and the ssl-server.xml file must exist in Drill’s classpath.
   Drill’s SSL configuration picks up the Hadoop SSL configuration.
   Note: Since the Drillbit implementation is based on JSSE, several
   standard parameters that apply to JSSE will also apply to the Drillbit,
   however you typically do not need to configure JSSE parameters.
   The following table lists the SSL configuration options with their
   descriptions and default values:

   CAPTION:

   Drill Property Name Hadoop Property Name System Property Name
   Description Allowed Values Drill Default
   drill.exec.security.user.encryption.ssl.enabled Enable or disable TLS
   for Drill client - Drill Server communication. You must set this option
   in drill-override.conf. true,false false
   drill.exec.ssl.protocol The version of the TLS protocol to use

   TLS, TLSV1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2
   TLSv1.2 (recommended)
   drill.exec.ssl.keyStoreType ssl.server.keystore.type
   javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType Format of the keystore file

   jks, jceks, pkcs12
   JKS
   drill.exec.ssl.keyStorePath ssl.server.keystore.location
   javax.net.ssl.keyStore Location of the Java keystore file containing
   the Drillbit’s own certificate and private key. On Windows, the
   specified pathname must use forward slashes, /, in place of
   backslashes.
   drill.exec.ssl.keyStorePassword ssl.server.keystore.password
   javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword Password to access the private key from
   the keystore file. This password is used twice: To unlock the keystore
   file (store password), and to decrypt the private key stored in the
   keystore (key password) unless a key password is specified separately.
   drill.exec.ssl.keyPassword ssl.server.keystore.keypassword Password to
   access the private key from the keystore file. May be different from
   the keystore password.
   drill.exec.ssl.trustStoreType ssl.server.truststore.type
   javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType Format of the truststore file

   jks, jceks, pkcs12
   JKS
   drill.exec.ssl.trustStorePath ssl.server.truststore.location
   javax.net.ssl.trustStore Location of the Java keystore file containing
   the collection of CA certificates trusted by the Drill client. On
   Windows, the specified pathname must use forward slashes, /, in place
   of backslashes.
   Note: If the trustStorePath is not provided, Drill ignores the
   trustStorePassword parameter and gets the default Java truststore
   instead, which causes issues if the Java truststore has a non-default
   password. The Java APIs to load the default keystore assume the default
   password. The only way to use the default keystore with a non-default
   password is to specify both the path and the password to the keystore.
   To work around this issue, pass the default Java truststore to the
   trustStorePath parameter.
   drill.exec.ssl.trustStorePassword ssl.server.truststore.password
   javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword Password to access the private key
   from the keystore file specified as the truststore.
   drill.exec.ssl.provider Changes the underlying implementation to the
   chosen value. OPENSSL/JDK default: JDK
   drill.exec.ssl.useHadoopConfig

   Use the setting in the hadoop configuration file.

   The hadoop configuration is specified in the file pointed to by the
   hadoop.ssl.server.conf parameter in the core-site.xml file. Typically,
   this parameter points to $HADOOP_CONF/ssl-server.xml which contains the
   property names to configure TLS.
   true/false

   default:true
