Configuring Encryption

   An administrator can enable encryption with MapR Security (tickets).
   Note: When the sasl_encrypt (for JDBC) or EnforceSaslEncrypt (for ODBC)
   connection parameter is set to "true" or 1, the Drill client only
   accepts encrypted connections. If the client tries connecting to a
   Drillbit with encryption disabled, the connection fails.
   Note: For client-side configuration, see [1]Drill Drivers.

   Set the encryption options to "true" in
   /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf.
   The following table lists the encryption configuration options with
   their descriptions and default values:
   Option Description Default
   drill.exec.security.user.encryption.sasl.enabled Determines if
   encryption on the server is enabled for negotiating privacy with the
   Drill client. false
   drill.exec.security.bit.encryption.sasl.enabled Determines if the
   server is enabled for negotiating privacy with another Drillbit. false

   The following sections provide configuration examples for Drill client
   to Drillbit encryption and Drillbit to Drillbit encryption.

Example 1: Drill Client to Drillbit Connection with MapR Security
Authentication and Encryption

   In the following server configuration, the Drill client connection to
   the Drillbit is encrypted using the MapR Security mechanism when the
   client is running with encryption support.
   Note: Drill clients running Drill 1.10 and earlier cannot connect to
   the Drillbit through MapR Securitywith encryption enabled.
drill.exec {
            security: {
                user.auth.enabled: true,
                auth.mechanisms : ["MAPRSASL"]
                user.encryption.sasl.enabled : true
                    }
                }

   Note: Drill executes all queries as a service or process user when
   impersonation is disabled.

Example 2: Drillbit to Drillbit Connection with MapR Security Authentication
and Encryption

   The following configuration authenticates and encrypts the path between
   Drillbits using the MapR Security mechanism.
drill.exec {
              security: {
                  auth.mechanisms : ["MAPRSASL"],
                  bit.auth.enabled : true
                  bit.auth.mechanisms : "MAPRSASL"
                  bit.encryption.sasl.enabled : true
        }
}

Example 3: Drill Client to Drillbit and Drillbit to Drillbit Connection with
MapR Security Authentication and Encryption

   The following configuration authenticates and encrypts the path between
   the Drill client and Drillbit, and between Drillbits using the MapR
   Security mechanism.
drill.exec {
              security: {
                 user.auth.enabled: true,
                 auth.mechanisms : ["MAPRSASL"],
                 user.encryption.sasl.enabled : true

                 bit.auth.enabled : true
                 bit.auth.mechanism : "MAPRSASL"
                 bit.encryption.sasl.enabled : true
                    }
                }

   Note: Drill executes all queries as a service or process user when
   impersonation is disabled.

Example 4: Drill Client to Drillbit and Drillbit to Drillbit Connection with
MapR Security Authentication and Encryption and Impersonation Enabled

   The following configuration authenticates and encrypts the path between
   the Drill client and Drillbit, and between Drillbits using the MapR
   Security mechanism.
drill.exec {
              security: {
                 user.auth.enabled: true,
                 auth.mechanisms : ["MAPRSASL"],
                 user.encryption.sasl.enabled : true

                 bit.auth.enabled : true
                 bit.auth.mechanism : "MAPRSASL"
                 bit.encryption.sasl.enabled : true
                    },
            impersonation: {
                   enabled: true,
                   max_chained_user_hops: 3
              }
          }

   Note: Drill executes all queries as the authenticated (ticket) user
   when impersonation is enabled.

Example 5: Drill Client to Drillbit Authentication and Encryption Enabled
using Multiple Mechanisms and Drillbit to Drillbit Authentication using MapR
Security

   The following configuration authenticates and encrypts the connection
   between the Drill client and Drillbit using multiple authentication
   mechanisms, and also authenticates and encrypts the connection between
   Drillbits using the MapR security mechanism.
   Note: Plain authentication not supported in this configuration.
drill.exec {
              security: {
                  user.auth.enabled: true,
                  auth.mechanisms : ["MAPRSASL", "KERBEROS"],
                  auth.principal : "mapr/_host@REALM.COM",
                  auth.keytab : "/opt/mapr/conf/mapr.keytab",
                  user.encryption.sasl.enabled : true,
                  bit.auth.enabled : true,
                  bit.auth.mechanism : "MAPRSASL",
                  bit.encryption.sasl.enabled : true
                      }
              impersonation: {
                  enabled: true,
                  max_chained_user_hops: 3
              }
           }


   Note: Drill executes all queries as a service or process user when
   impersonation is disabled.
