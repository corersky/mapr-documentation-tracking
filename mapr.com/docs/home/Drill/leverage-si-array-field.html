Writing Drill Queries that Leverage Indexes on Array Fields

   Starting in MEP 6.0, the query planner in Drill can leverage indexes
   created on MapR Database JSON document fields with array data types,
   such as "NUMBERS": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and "ADDRESSES": [{"CITY" : "SAN
   JOSE"}, {"CITY" : "PALO ALTO"}].

   See [1]JSON Document Data Types and [2]Data Types and Secondary Index
   Fields for definitions and detailed examples.
   If you want the query planner in Drill to leverage an index created on
   a field with an array data type, you must write the Drill query such
   that it includes specific SQL syntax, as shown in bold in the following
   example:
SELECT NAME, PHONE
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE _id IN ( SELECT _id
               FROM ( SELECT _id, FLATTEN(ADDRESSES) as f
          FROM CUSTOMERS) as t
               WHERE t.f.CITY = 'SAN JOSE' and t.f.STATE = 'CA')
;

   The specific SQL syntax indicates (to the query planner in Drill) that
   the query is eligible for an index-based query plan.

   The [3]FLATTEN function separates elements in an array into individual
   records in a table. For example, if an array consists of five elements,
   FLATTEN separates each element into a single row, creating a table with
   five rows.

   The IN operator prevents Drill from returning duplicate rows. For
   example, when an array is flattened into a table, duplicate values may
   exist for a particular _id (rowkey). Using IN prevents Drill from
   returning rows with duplicate values.

Example

   Suppose a JSON primary table named CUSTOMERS exists in MapR Database
   with the following data:
{ "_id": "001",
 "NAME": "ALICE",
 "PHONE": "408-555-1212",
 "ADDRESSES": [{"CITY" : "SAN JOSE" , "ZIPCODE" : 95124, "STATE" : "CA", "UNITS"
 : [{"UNIT_NO":555, "FLOOR": 5}, {"UNIT_NO":777, "FLOOR": 7}]}, {"CITY" : "PALO
ALTO", "ZIPCODE" : 94020, "STATE" : "CA",  "UNITS" : [{"UNIT_NO":555, "FLOOR": 5
}, {"UNIT_NO":777, "FLOOR": 7}]}, {"CITY" : "SANTA CLARA", "ZIPCODE" : 95050, "S
TATE" : "CA", "UNITS" : [{"UNIT_NO":555, "FLOOR": 5}, {"UNIT_NO":777, "FLOOR": 7
}]}],
  "QTY": [11, 25, 16, 2, 10, 39, 5, 8, 7, 11]
}
{ "_id": "002",
 "NAME": "BOB",
 "PHONE": "408-555-1313",
 "ADDRESSES": [{"CITY" : "SAN JOSE" , "ZIPCODE" : 95132, "STATE" : "CA", "UNITS"
 : [{"UNIT_NO":838, "FLOOR": 8}, {"UNIT_NO":888, "FLOOR": 8}]}, {"CITY" : "SAN J
OSE", "ZIPCODE" : 95127, "STATE" : "CA", "UNITS" : [{"UNIT_NO":555, "FLOOR": 5},
 {"UNIT_NO":777, "FLOOR": 7}]}, {"CITY" : "SAN RAMON", "ZIPCODE" : 94582, "STATE
" : "CA", "UNITS" : [{"UNIT_NO":123, "FLOOR": 1}, {"UNIT_NO":124, "FLOOR": 1}]}]
,
 "QTY": [2, 8, 1, 4, 3, 10, 2, 23]
}
{ "_id": "003",
 "NAME": "CHRIS",
 "PHONE": "408-555-1414",
 "ADDRESSES": [{"CITY" : "MOUNTAIN VIEW", "ZIPCODE" : 94043, "STATE" : "CA", "UN
ITS" : [{"UNIT_NO":922, "FLOOR": 9}, {"UNIT_NO":958, "FLOOR": 9}]}, {"CITY" : "P
ALO ALTO", "ZIPCODE" : 94020, "STATE" : "CA", "UNITS" : [{"UNIT_NO":666, "FLOOR"
: 6}, {"UNIT_NO":728, "FLOOR": 7}]}, {"CITY" : "SUNNYVALE", "ZIPCODE" : 94086, "
STATE" : "CA", "UNITS" : [{"UNIT_NO":226, "FLOOR": 2}, {"UNIT_NO":333, "FLOOR":
3}]}],
 "QTY": [56, 19, 45, 25, 4, 77, 110, 3, 2, 1]
}

   Note: The QTY field is an array. The ADDRESSES field is an array of
   maps.
   The following query on the CUSTOMERS table returns the result of
   flattening the “ADDRESSES" array field into a column aliased as “f"
   where each element in the array is flattened into individual rows:
   Note: In the results, notice that Bob has two addresses where the
   “CITY" is “SAN JOSE". Later in this example, you will see that using
   the IN operator prevents the query from returning duplicate rows.
SELECT NAME, PHONE, f FROM (SELECT NAME, PHONE, FLATTEN(ADDRESSES) AS f  FROM CU
STOMERS);

   Suppose a composite index exists on ADDRESSES[].CITY and
   ADDRESSES[].STATEwith "NAME" as an included field. For the query
   planner to use the index, you must write the query using the specific
   SQL syntax that indicates that the query is eligible for an index-based
   query plan, as shown:
SELECT NAME, PHONE
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE _id IN ( SELECT _id
               FROM ( SELECT _id, FLATTEN(ADDRESSES) as f
          FROM CUSTOMERS) as t
               WHERE t.f.CITY = 'SAN JOSE' and t.f.STATE = 'CA');

//Issuing this query against the data in the CUSTOMERS table returns the followi
ng results:
+--------+---------------+
|  NAME  |     PHONE     |
+--------+---------------+
| ALICE  | 408-555-1212  |
| BOB    | 408-555-1313  |
+--------+---------------+


   Note: Although Bob has two addresses where the "CITY" is "SAN JOSE",
   the query returns only one result. The IN operator prevents the query
   from returning duplicate rows.

   The following list summarizes key points about this query:
     * The innermost subquery projects on the _id field (rowkey) and
       includes the FLATTEN function to separate the array elements in the
       “ADDRESSES” field. The field “ADDRESSES” is flattened into a table
       aliased as “t”, in a column aliased as “f”.
     * The query uses the IN operator to ensure that the results returned
       contain unique values only; no duplicates. DISTINCT on the subquery
       to the right of IN is implicit. The SQL query pattern indicates to
       the query planner that the query is eligible for an index-based
       query plan.
     * The query projects on column “NAME” and “PHONE”. “PHONE” requires a
       join back to the primary table on the _id field (rowkey) because it
       is not included in the composite index.
     * The query planner recognizes that t.f.CITY references
       t.ADDRESSES[].CITY and t.f.STATE references t.ADDRESSES[].STATE and
       creates an index-based query plan.
     * The index table in MapR Database is already flattened for the array
       field, “ADDRESSES”. Flatten is not evaluated in Drill. Drill pushes
       the filter conditions on the array field into MapR Database.

Filter Conditions on Various Types of Array Fields

   The following table shows examples of filter conditions on various
   types of array fields and includes the MapR Database notation for the
   array field with the filter condition, as well as the SQL syntax for
   writing queries against the array fields.
   Note: The queries in the table are written against the CUSTOMERS data
   used in the previous example.

Performance Considerations

   When writing queries that leverage indexes on array fields, consider
   the following points about performance:
     * Query patterns that match those described previously in this
       document are pushed down to MapR Database. Drill does not evaluate
       the filter conditions, which adds considerable performance benefits
       even when the query planner does not select an index-based query
       plan.
     * Deduplication on the _id is an extra operation (compared to
       regular, non-complex, indexes) that requires the overhead of hash
       aggregation.
     * Try to avoid array columns in included fields within an index
       table, as they add a significant amount of storage overhead.
       However, this may result in the query planner selecting
       non-covering plans.
     * Indexes with deeply nested array elements, such as
       a[].b[].c[]...x.y, can add to the MapR Database storage overhead
       and can potentially make Drill queries longer and more complex.

Limitations

   Drill queries that leverage indexes on array fields have the following
   limitations:
     * Only queries with patterns similar to those described previously in
       this document are eligible for index planning, assuming that the
       index is defined on an array field.
     * The following conditions do not produce a covering index plan:
          + Pushdown conditions on indexed fields and included fields on
            same array element. For example, if an index has indexed
            fields a[].b and included fields a[].c, elementAND(a[], b >
            10, c > 20) does not produce a covering index plan.
          + Pushdown conditions on scalar indexed fields and included
            fields containing an array element. For example, an index with
            indexed field m and included fields a[].b, m = 10 AND a[].b >
            20 does not produce a covering index plan.
     * For included array fields, the element must be provided without the
       [] for the query planner to pick covering plans. For example, a and
       not a[]. Note that MapR Database considers both a and a[] syntaxes
       as equivalent for included fields.
     * Index planning is disabled for queries with multi-level flattens
       and intermediate filters that reference multi-level flattens. A
       filter can reference the root level flatten, but not the
       intermediate flattens.
