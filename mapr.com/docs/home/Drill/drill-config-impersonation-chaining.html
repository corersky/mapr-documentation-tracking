Configuring Impersonation and Chaining

   Impersonation allows a service to act on behalf of a client while
   performing the action requested by the client. Chaining is a
   system-wide setting that applies to all views. Currently, Drill does
   not provide an option to allow different chain lengths for different
   views.
   Complete the following steps on each Drillbit node to enable user
   impersonation, and set the maximum number of chained user hops that
   Drill allows:
    1. Navigate to <drill_installation_directory>/conf/ and edit
       drill-override.conf.
    2. Under drill.exec, add the following:
drill.exec.impersonation: {
                  enabled: true,
                  max_chained_user_hops: 3
  }
       Alternatively, you can nest impersonation within the drill.exec
       block, as shown in the following example:
drill.exec: {
           cluster-id: "cluster_name",
           zk.connect: "<hostname>:<port>,<hostname>:<port>,<hostname>:<port>",
           sys.store.provider.zk.blobroot: "hdfs://",
           impersonation: {
             enabled: true,
             max_chained_user_hops: 3
           }
         }
    3. Set the maximum number of chained user hops.
    4. In <drill_installation_directory>/conf/drill-env.sh, add one of the
       following lines:
          + If the underlying file system has MapR security enabled, add
            the following line: export
            MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION=/opt/mapr/conf/mapruserticket
          + If the underlying file system is not secure, add the following
            line: export MAPR_IMPERSONATION_ENABLED=true
    5. Restart the Drillbit process on each Drill node.
maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <node-hostnames-se
parated-by-a-space> -f
