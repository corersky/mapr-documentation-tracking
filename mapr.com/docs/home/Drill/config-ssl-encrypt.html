SSL/TLS for Encryption

   You can enable SSL for Drill in a secure or unsecure MapR cluster. SSL
   (Secure Sockets Layer), more recently called TLS, is a security
   mechanism that encrypts data passed between the Drill client and
   Drillbit (server). SSL also provides one-way authentication through
   which the Drill client verifies the identity of the Drillbit.

   Authentication occurs during the SSL handshake when the Drillbit
   (server) presents its certificate to the client, and the client checks
   if the certificate exists in its truststore or if the certificate is
   signed by a trusted CA (Certificate Authority) that exists in its
   truststore.
   The following diagram depicts the communication between the Drill
   client and the Drillbit (server):

   The SASL feature in Drill provides authentication and an option to
   encrypt data, however the encryption feature is not available when
   using Plain authentication. If you need to use Plain authentication
   (certain BI tools only use Plain authentication), you can enable SSL to
   encrypt data. You can have both SASL and SSL enabled when using Plain
   authentication only. For any other scenario, using SSL and SASL
   encryption together is strongly discouraged.
   The following diagram depicts the SSL communication paths between the
   Drill client and Drillbit (server), including the scenario where Plain
   authentication is used:

   Note: The REST API supports HTTPS. SSL is not supported for
   communication between Drillbits.

   The following sections provide information about how to use
   certificates in secure and unsecure MapR clusters, enabling and
   configuring SSL, connection parameters, and common SSL issues.
