MapR-DB Format Plugin for Drill

   Drill supports access to MapR-DB JSON and binary tables through the
   maprdb format plugin in Drill.

   When you install Drill, the maprdb format is automatically defined
   within the default dfs storage plugin configuration to make MapR-DB a
   consumable data source for Drill. You can access the dfs storage plugin
   configuration from the Storage page in the [1]Drill Web Console.

   The following sections describe configuration options specific to the
   maprdb format plugin and provide information about MapR-DB tables,
   including the types of tables supported, the differences between them,
   and how to query each type of table from Drill.

   For additional information about storage plugins, see [2]Plugin
   Configuration Basics.
