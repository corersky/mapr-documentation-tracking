Client Application Interfaces

   Drill also provides additional application interfaces for the client
   tools to connect and access from Drill. The interfaces include the
   following.

ODBC/JDBC drivers

   Drill provides ODBC/JDBC drivers to connect from BI tools such as
   Tableau, MicroStrategy, SQUirrel, and Jaspersoft; refer to [1]Drill
   Interfaces Introduction to learn more.

SQLLine

   SQLLine is a JDBC application that comes packaged with Drill. In order
   to start working with it, you can use the command line on the demo
   cluster to log in as root, then enter sqlline. Use mapr as the login
   password. For example:
$ ssh root@localhost -p 2222
Password:
Last login: Mon Sep 15 13:46:08 2014 from 10.250.0.28
Welcome to your Mapr Demo virtual machine.
[root@maprdemo ~]# sqlline
sqlline version 1.1.6
0: jdbc:drill:>

Drill Web UI

   The Drill Web UI is a simple user interface for configuring and manage
   Drill. This UI can be launched from any of the nodes in the Drill
   cluster. The configuration for Drill includes setting up storage
   plugins that represent the data sources on which Drill performs
   queries. The sandbox comes with storage plugins configured for the
   Hive, MapR-DB binary tables, MapR file system, and local file system.

   Users and developers can get the necessary information for tuning and
   performing diagnostics on queries, such as the list of queries executed
   in a session and detailed query plan profiles for each.

   Detailed configuration and management of Drill is out of scope for this
   tutorial.

   The following Web Console for Drill also provides a query UI where
   users can submit queries to Drill and observe results.
