Start the Web Console

   The Drill Web Console is one of several [1]client interfaces that you
   can use to access Drill.

Drill 1.1 and Earlier

   In Drill 1.1 and earlier, to open the Drill Web Console, launch a web
   browser, and go to the following URL:
   http://<IP address or host name>:8047

   where IP address is the host name or IP address of one of the installed
   Drillbits in a distributed system or localhost in an embedded system.

Drill 1.2 and Later

   In Drill 1.2 and later, to open the Drill Web Console, launch a web
   browser, and go to one of the following URLs depending on the
   configuration of HTTPS support:
     * http://<IP address or host name>:8047 Use this URL when HTTPS
       support is disabled (the default).
     * https://<IP address or host name>:8047 Use this URL when HTTPS
       support is enabled

   If [2]user authentication is not enabled, all the Web Console controls
   appear to users as well as administrators:

   User authentication not enabled

   If user authentication is enabled, Drill prompts you for a user
   name/password:

   prompt for credentials

   If an [3]administrator logs in, all the Web Console controls appear:
   Query, Profiles, Storage, Metrics, Threads, and Options. The Profiles
   page for administrators contains the profiles of all queries executed
   on a cluster. Only administrators can see and use the Storage tab to
   view, update, or add a new storage plugin configuration. Only
   administrators can see and use the Threads tab, which provides
   information about threads running in Drill.

   administrator UI controls

   If a user, who is not an administrator, logs in, the Web Console
   controls are limited to Query, Metrics, and Profiles. The Profiles tab
   for a non-administrator user contains the profiles of all queries the
   user issued either through ODBC, JDBC, or the Web Console.

   controls visible to an ordinary user
