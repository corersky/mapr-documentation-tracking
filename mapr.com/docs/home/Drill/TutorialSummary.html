Summary

   This tutorial introduced Drill and its ability to run ANSI SQL queries
   against various data sources, including Hive tables, MapR-DB binary
   tables, and file system directories. The tutorial also showed how to
   work with and manipulate complex and multi-structured data commonly
   found in Hadoop/NoSQL systems.

   Now that you are familiar with different ways to access the sample data
   with Drill, you can try writing your own queries against your own data
   sources. Refer to the [1]Apache Drill documentation for more
   information.
