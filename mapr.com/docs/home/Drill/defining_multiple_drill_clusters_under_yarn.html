Defining Multiple Drill Clusters within YARN

   Complete the following steps to define multiple Drill clusters under
   YARN:
    1. Create a new "site" directory under $DRILL_HOME, and create an
       environment variable for the directory.
mkdir $DRILL_HOME/<site_name>
export $<SITE_NAME>_SITE=$DRILL_HOME/<site_name>
    2. Copy the following configuration files from the existing “site”
       directory into the new “site” directory:
          + drill-override.conf
          + drill-env.sh
          + drill-on-yarn.conf
          + distrib-env.sh
    3. Modify the settings in the drill.exec section of
       $DRILL_SITE/drill-override.conf to configure the new Drill cluster
       to act independently of the other Drill cluster(s), or share
       settings, such as storage plugin configurations. For the new Drill
       cluster to act independently, give zk.root a distinct name from the
       existing clusters. In the more advanced scenario where the clusters
       share configurations, give zk.root the same name as the existing
       Drill clusters. When the clusters share the same root, they must
       have distinct cluster-id values. The user, bit, and http ports must
       have values distinct from all the other Drill clusters.
       The following example shows a number 1 added to the first digit of
       the default port numbers, however you can choose any available
       ports.
drill.exec: {
 cluster-id: "drillbits",
 zk: {
   root: "<site_name>"
   connect: "zk-host:5181"
 }

 rpc {
   user.server.port: 41010
   bit.server.port: 41011
 }
 http.port: 9047
}

    4. Modify the drill-on-yarn.conf configuration file for the new
       cluster. The new cluster must have a distinct name, a distinct
       upload directory in the file system, and a distinct port number.
       The following settings in the drill.yarn section must have distinct
       values for the new cluster:
drill.yarn: {
 app-name: "Distinct Cluster Name"

 dfs: {
   app-dir: "/upload/directory"
 }

 http : {
   port: <distinct port number>
 }
}

    5. Start the new cluster from the "site" directory that correlates
       with the new cluster.
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh --site $NEW_SITE start
