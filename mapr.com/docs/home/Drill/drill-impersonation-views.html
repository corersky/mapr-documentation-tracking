Impersonation and Views

   You can use views with impersonation to provide granular access to data
   and protect sensitive information.

   When you create a view, Drill stores the view definition in a file and
   suffixes the file with view.drill. For example, if you create a view
   named myview, Drill creates a view file named myview.view.drill and
   saves it in the current workspace or the workspace specified, such as
   dfs.views.myview. See [1]CREATE VIEW.

   You can create a view and grant read permissions on the view to give
   other users access to the data that the view references. When a user
   queries a view on which s/he has read access, Drill impersonates the
   view owner to access the underlying data. If the user tries to query
   the data directly (instead of using the view), Drill returns a
   permission denied error. A user with read access to a view can create
   new views from the originating view to further restrict access on data.

View Permissions

   A user must have write permission on a directory or workspace to create
   a view, as well as read access on the table(s) and/or view(s) that the
   view references. When a user creates a view, permission on the view is
   set to owner by default. Users can query an existing view or create new
   views from the view if they have read permissions on the view file and
   the directory or workspace where the view file is stored.

   When users query a view, Drill accesses the underlying data as the user
   that created the view. If a user does not have permission to access a
   view, the query fails and Drill returns an error. Only the view owner
   or a superuser can modify view permissions to change them from owner to
   group or world.

   The view owner or a superuser can modify permissions on the view file
   directly or they can set view permissions at the system or session
   level prior to creating any views. Any user that alters view
   permissions must have write access on the directory or workspace in
   which they are working.

Modifying Permissions on a View File

   Only a view owner or a super user can modify permissions on a view file
   to change them from owner to group or world readable. Before you grant
   permission to users to access a view, verify that they have access to
   the directory or workspace in which the view file is stored.
   Use the chmod and chown commands with the appropriate octal code to
   change permissions on a view file:
hadoop fs –chmod <octal code> <file_name>
hadoop fs –chown <user>:<group> <file_name>
//hadoop fs –chmod 750 employees.view.drill

Modifying SYSTEM|SESSION Level View Permissions

   Use the ALTER SESSION|SYSTEM command with the
   new_view_default_permissions parameter and the appropriate octal code
   to set view permissions at the system or session level prior to
   creating a view.
ALTER SESSION SET `new_view_default_permissions` = '<octal_code>';
ALTER SYSTEM SET `new_view_default_permissions` = '<octal_code>';
//ALTER SESSION SET `new_view_default_permissions` = '777';

   After you set this parameter, Drill applies the same permissions on
   each view created during the session or across all sessions if set at
   the system level.
