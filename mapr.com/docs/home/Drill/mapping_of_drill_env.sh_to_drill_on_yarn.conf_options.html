Mapping of drill-env.sh to drill-on-yarn.conf Options

   When you run Drill as a standalone application, you set startup
   options, such as drillbit memory, in the $DRILL_HOME/conf/drill-env.sh
   start up script. Under YARN, Drill still reads $DRILL_SITE/drill-env.sh
   for configuration options, however Drill-on-YARN provides the
   $DRILL_SITE/drill-on-yarn.conf file to configure options that were
   formerly set in drill-env.sh.
   The following table maps the drill-env.sh environment variables to
   their equivalent configuration parameters in drill-on-yarn.conf:

   CAPTION:

   drill-env.sh Environment Variable drill-on-yarn.conf Configuration
   Parameter
   DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY * drill.yarn.drillbit.max-direct-memory
   DRILL_HEAP * drill.yarn.drillbit.heap
   DRILL_JAVA_OPTS drill.yarn.drillbit.vm-args (Added to those in
   drill-env.sh.)
   SERVER_GC_OPTS (to add GC logging) Drill.yarn.drillbit.log-gc (To
   enable GC logging)
   DRILL_HOME Set automatically when files are localized
   (drill.yarn.drill-install. localize is true), else
   drill.yarn.drill-install. drill-home.
   DRILL_CONF_DIR Set automatically when files are localized, else uses
   the normal defaults.
   DRILL_LOG_DIR Set automatically to point to YARNâ€™s log directory unless
   disabled by setting drill.yarn.drillbit. disable-yarn-logs to false. If
   disabled, uses the normal Drill defaults.
   DRILL_CLASSPATH_PREFIX * Drill.yarn.drillbit. prefix-class-path
   HADOOP_CLASSPATH * drill.yarn.hadoop.class-path (or, better
   drill.yarn.drillbit. extn-class-path.)
   HBASE_CLASSPATH * Drill.yarn.hadoop. hbase-class-path (or, better
   drill.yarn.drillbit. extn-class-path.)
   EXTN_CLASSPATH * (New in Drill 1.8.) Drill.yarn.drillbit.
   extn-class-path
   DRILL_CLASSPATH * drill.yarn.drillbit.class-path
