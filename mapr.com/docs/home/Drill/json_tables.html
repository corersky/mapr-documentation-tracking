JSON Tables

   A JSON table is a collection of JSON documents stored in an optimized
   format in MapR Database. JSON tables support complex schema, like JSON
   files including nested and repeated types, but with additional support
   for more [1]data types.

   JSON tables leverage the [2]OJAI API to natively support [3]Drill data
   types making it possible for MapR Database to recognize, store, and
   interpret each of the Drill data types. This alleviates the need to
   encode data when an application writes to tables or use conversion
   functions when running queries against tables. For example, if a number
   or date is stored in a JSON table, you do not need to use the CAST or
   [4]CONVERT functions for the query to return the actual values.

   MapR Database's native support for Drill data types enables Drill to
   push down filters and projections to MapR Database which optimizes
   performance.

Querying a JSON Table

   Querying JSON tables is simpler than querying binary tables because you
   do not have to include conversion functions in the queries to change
   the byte sequences into specific data types, and you do not have to
   include column families.

   The following query examples show query results on a JSON table named
   “students” in MapR Database. Note that Drill returns human readable
   values without having to include the CAST or CONVERT functions in the
   queries.

   Example 1
   SELECT * FROM dfs.`/user/root/json/students`;
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------------+----------+
|    _id    |    date     |  name  | state  |      street       | zipcode  |
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------------+----------+
| student1  | 2016-01-15  | Alice  | CA     | 123 Ballmer Av    | 12345    |
| student2  | 2016-03-08  | Bob    | CA     | 1 Infinite Loop   | 12345    |
| student3  | 2015-12-22  | Frank  | CA     | 435 Walker Ct     | 12345    |
| student4  | 2015-09-15  | Mary   | CA     | 56 Southern Pkwy  | 12345    |
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------------+----------+
4 rows selected (0.233 seconds)

   Example 2
   SELECT _id, `date`, name, state, street, zipcode FROM
   dfs.`/user/root/json/students`;
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------------+----------+
|    _id    |    date     |  name  | state  |      street       | zipcode  |
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------------+----------+
| student1  | 2016-01-15  | Alice  | CA     | 123 Ballmer Av    | 12345.0  |
| student2  | 2016-03-08  | Bob    | CA     | 1 Infinite Loop   | 12345.0  |
| student3  | 2015-12-22  | Frank  | CA     | 435 Walker Ct     | 12345.0  |
| student4  | 2015-09-15  | Mary   | CA     | 56 Southern Pkwy  | 12345.0  |
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------------+----------+
