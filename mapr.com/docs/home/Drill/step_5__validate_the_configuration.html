Step 5: Validate Cluster Configuration and Status

   If all goes well, the Drill-on-YARN command line tool prints a URL for
   the Drill Application Master process that you can use to monitor the
   cluster. The drillbits should be up and running, unless the upload or
   launch failed.

   Failed upload
          If the upload fails, the most likely reason is that the
          HADOOP_HOME variable is not set, or the user launching
          Drill-on-YARN does not have permission to create or write to the
          DFS location set in the Drill-on-YARN configuration file.

   Failed launch
          If the launch fails, verify that the YARN maximum container size
          was set to be at least as large as the Drill container size and
          that YARN can provide the number of vcores and disks you have
          requested for Drill.

Monitor Cluster Activity

   When the cluster launches successfully, you can verify the status of
   the components in the Drill cluster from the command line or you can
   copy the Application Master URL into your browser to use the
   Application Master web UI.
   To check the status from the command line, issue the following command:
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh --site $DRILL_SITE status
     * Verify that the drillbits are in the Running state (or transition
       to that state after a few moments.) If the drillbits remain in the
       Requesting state, the likely cause is that YARN cannot provide a
       container of the requested size. You can access this information on
       the Drillbits page in the Application Master web UI.
     * Verify that the Application Master has correctly picked up the
       YARN-related configuration from drill-override.conf and
       drill-on-yarn.conf. You can access this information on the
       Configuration page in the Application Master web UI.
     * Verify that the Application Master is running. The Drill
       Application Master uses ZooKeeper to verify that only one
       Application Master runs per Drill cluster. The Application Master
       fails if ZooKeeper is down, is configured incorrectly in
       drill-override.conf, or if another Application Master is running
       for the same cluster.
     * Verify that that the configurations in are correct in
       drill-override.conf if there are drillbit failures. Drill-on-YARN
       detects drillbit failures and retries each drillbit a few times. If
       the drillbit continues to fail, the node is black-listed for that
       run of Drill-on-YARN. You can see failures in the History page of
       the web UI. If your Drillbits fail, the most likely reason is
       misconfiguration within drill-override.conf. Use YARN to locate and
       view the Drill logs for the failed container.

Resize the Cluster

   If the cluster works well for a single node, you can increase the
   number of nodes.
   Note: In the Drill 1.8 release, adding nodes can be done while users
   run queries. However, removing nodes from the cluster causes queries to
   fail, and so should only be done when the cluster is idle.
   To make a permanent change, modify the cluster size in
   drill-on-yarn.conf:
cluster: [
   {
     ...
     count: 5
   }
 ]

   You can also resize the cluster dynamically. To add two nodes from the
   command line:
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh --site $DRILL_SITE resize +2

   To set the cluster size to a total of five nodes:
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh --site $DRILL_SITE resize 5

   To remove one of the nodes:
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh --site $DRILL_SITE resize -1

   You can also resize your cluster using the Manage page of the
   Application Master web UI, by entering the number of desired nodes and
   clicking Go.

Stop the Cluster

   You can stop the cluster from the command line or from the Manage page
   in the Application Master web UI.
   To stop the cluster from the command line, issue the following command:
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh --site $DRILL_SITE stop
