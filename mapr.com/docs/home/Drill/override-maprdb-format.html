Overriding Default maprdb Format Plugin Settings in drill-override.conf

   You can override the default maprdb format plugin settings that control
   the level of parallelism in Drill and the media type in the
   drill-override.conf file.
   To override the default maprdb format plugin settings, add the options
   to the format-maprdb.json configuration in the
   /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf file, as
   shown:
format-maprdb: {
                json: {
                    scanSizeMB: 512,
                    restrictedScanSizeMB: 4096
                    mediaType: hdd
                    }
                  }

   The following sections describe how to modify the options in the
   configuration shown above:

Configuring the Level of Parallelism in Drill

   The size of data chunks and number of minor fragments affect the level
   of parallelism in Drill. When querying JSON tables, Drill creates minor
   fragments that scan the chunks of data that MapR-DB passes to Drill.
   Minor fragments are logical units of work that determine the level of
   parallelism in Drill. The level of parallelism increases with the
   number of minor fragments. See [1]Drill Query Execution for more
   information about how Drill executes a query.

   Modifying the Size of Data Chunks

   The format-maprdb.json.scanSizeMB option changes the size of data
   chunks that MapR-DB passes to Drill when querying JSON tables. Drill
   creates approximately one minor fragment per data chunk when querying
   JSON tables. For example, if a table has 4 GB of data and the chunk
   size is set to 128 MB, Drill creates approximately 32 minor fragments
   to scan the data chunks.

   The default setting for data chunks is 128 MB, however you can override
   this default in the drill-override.conf file. The value of the
   format-maprdb.json.scanSizeMB option can range from 32 MB to 8192 MB (8
   GB). Adjust the setting based on the size of your tables. Use a higher
   setting for larger tables and a lower setting for smaller tables. The
   right setting can reduce latency and increase throughput.

   Modifying the Number of Minor Fragments Created

   The format-maprdb.json.restrictedScanSizeMB option determines the
   number of minor fragments that Drill creates to scan the data and do
   the join-back to a JSON table when executing a non-covering index plan.
   The default setting for this option is 4096 MB, however you can
   override this setting in the drill-override.conf file. The value of
   this option can range from 32 MB to 8192 MB (8 GB). Adjust the setting
   based on the size of your tables, keeping in mind that due to the
   random I/O nature of the join-back, a smaller setting (increased
   parallelism) may not necessarily increase throughput.
   Note: The planner.slice_target option in Drill determines the number of
   minor fragments that can run in parallel. See [2]Modifying Query
   Planning Options for more information.

Configuring the Media Type

   Drill is optimized for SSDs, however MapR-DB and Drill can run on HDDs.
   If you run Drill and MapR-DB on HDDs, use the mediaType option in the
   drill-override.conf file to override the default setting. The mediaType
   option accepts hdd or ssd (default) as the value.
