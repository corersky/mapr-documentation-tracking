Drill-on-YARN Overview

   Running Drill as a YARN application (Drill-on-YARN) enables Drill to
   work alongside other applications, such as Hadoop and Spark, in a
   YARN-managed cluster. If you are currently running Drill under Warden,
   you can upgrade Drill and continue to run Drill under Warden, or you
   can migrate Drill to run under YARN. See [1]Migrate Drill to Run Under
   YARN for instructions.

   YARN assigns resources, such as memory and CPU, to applications in the
   cluster and eliminates the manual steps associated with installation
   and resource allocation for stand-alone applications in a multi-tenant
   environment. YARN automatically deploys (localizes) the Drill software
   onto each Drill node and manages the Drill cluster. Drill becomes a
   long-running application with YARN. You can monitor the Drill-on-YARN
   cluster using the Application Master web UI.

Resource Usage

   By design, Drill aggressively uses all of the resources available to
   run queries at optimal speed. When Drill runs under YARN, you must
   inform YARN of the resources that Drill needs. The resource settings
   are descriptive, not proscriptive. Drill does not limit itself to the
   YARN settings, instead the YARN settings inform YARN of the resources
   that Drill will consume so that YARN does not over-allocate those
   resources to other tasks.

   The MapR version of YARN manages CPU, memory, and disks. YARN calls
   settings for memory and CPU “vcores." You configure Drill’s memory and
   then inform YARN of the Drill configuration. Drill uses all available
   disk I/O and CPU.

Components

   Several software components work together to run Drill as a YARN
   application. Drill, YARN, and the Drill-on-YARN application
   collectively provide the components required to run Drill under YARN.

   The following table lists the software components with their
   descriptions:
   Software Component Description
   YARN Resource Manager The Resource Manager manages the set of
   applications running on the cluster. Each cluster must have one
   Resource Manager.
     Node Manager The Node Manager manages the application tasks running
   on a particular node. Each node in a cluster must have one Node
   Manager.
   Drill Drillbit A drillbit is the Drill daemon software that YARN runs
   on each node in the cluster. See[2]Drill Query Execution. The drillbit
   process on the node acts as the application task.
     Client A client, such as JDBC, ODBC, or SQLLine sends queries to a
   drillbit. The client uses ZooKeeper to discover a drillbit that the
   client treats as the Foreman. See[3]Drill Clients.
     Drill distribution archive The Drill distribution archive is a Drill
   distribution .tar.gz file included with the Drill installation.
   Drill-on-YARN uploads this archive to the distributed file system
   (DFS). YARN downloads (localizes) the file to each worker node.
   ZooKeeper ZooKeeper ZooKeeper is the service that tracks the available
   set of drillbit processes. The Foreman for a query uses ZooKeeper to
   identify the set of available drill nodes that can run the query.
   See[4]Drill Query Execution.
   Drill-on-YARN Application Application Master (AM) The Application
   Manager requests containers from the Resource Manager and launches
   drillbits using those containers. The AM monitors Drillbits, detects
   failures, and restarts failed Drillbits. The AM also provides a web UI
   to manage the Drill cluster.
     Drill-on-YARN client The Drill-on-YARN client is a command-line
   program that starts, stops, and monitors the Drill cluster. The client
   provides the information that YARN needs to start the Application
   Master. The client can run on any machine that has both the Drill and
   YARN client software. The client does not have to be part of the YARN
   cluster.
     drill-on-yarn.conf The drill-on-yarn.conf configuration file provides
   the information that Drill-on-YARN needs to manage the Drill cluster.
   This file is separate from the configuration files for Drill itself.

Component Workflow

   Running Drill as a YARN application is mostly an automated process
   carried out by the Drill and YARN components. After an administrator
   installs, configures, and launches Drill from the Drill-on-YARN client,
   YARN deploys (localizes) Drill on to designated nodes and starts the
   Drill process on each node.

   The following diagram shows the workflow between the components in a
   cluster with the steps that Drill and YARN complete to deploy and run
   Drill as a YARN application:
