Drill ODBC Driver

   MapR provides a Drill ODBC driver that you can use on all platforms to
   connect BI tools, such as Tableau, to Drill.
   You can download the latest ODBC driver [1]here. The documentation for
   the Drill ODBC 1.3.15 driver is available at [2]Drill ODBC Driver.
   Note: If you plan to use MapR-SASL for authentication on Windows, see
   the following section for additional information and instructions.

Using MapR-SASL for Authentication on Windows

   Drill is automatically configured with [3]MapR security when you
   install Drill 1.11 and later on a MapR 6.0 cluster configured with
   default security. To successfully connect to Drill from a Windows ODBC
   client, a MapR user ticket must exist on the Windows client in the
   %TEMP% directory or in the location specified by the
   $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable.

   The ODBC driver locates user tickets for the current Windows user in
   the default ticket location, %TEMP%, or in the location specified by
   the environment variable, $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION. See [4]Tickets and
   [5]Generating a MapR User Ticket for more information.
   You can either copy a user ticket that was generated on the MapR
   cluster into the default location (%TEMP%), or you can install the MapR
   client on the Windows client and then run the [6]maprlogin command to
   generate the ticket on the Windows client.
   Note: The ODBC user must be the same as the Windows user that created
   the ticket.

   Example
   If you want to connect to Drill as the mapr user, you must create a
   ticket for the mapr user, as shown:
$ maprlogin password -user mapr
[Password for user 'mapr' at cluster 'Cluster1':]

   The MapR credentials for the mapr user in Cluster1 are written to
   /tmp/maprticket_1000.
   Next, place the ticket in the %TEMP% directory on the Windows client.
   For example, the default location for a Windows 10 user named Tabetha
   Stephens is shown:
'C:\Users\TABETH~1\AppData\Local\Temp/maprticket_Tabetha Stephens'

   To override this location, set the "MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION" global
   variable for the Windows user.
   Note: Using the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION is recommended because the
   %TEMP% directory differs between Windows versions. You may also want to
   set the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION per user on the operating system to
   prevent all users from using the same user ticket on the client.
