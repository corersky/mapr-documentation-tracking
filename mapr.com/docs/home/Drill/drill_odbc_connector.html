Drill ODBC Driver

   MapR provides a Drill ODBC driver that you can use on all platforms to
   connect BI tools, such as Tableau, to Drill.
   You can download the latest ODBC driver [1]here.
   Note: You can download previews of the MapR [2]ODBC driver for Drill
   1.14. Earlier versions of the drivers do not work with Drill 1.14.
   The documentation for the Drill ODBC driver is available at [3]Drill
   ODBC Driver.
   Note: Updated driver documentation for Drill 1.14 will be available
   soon.
   Note: If you plan to use MapR-SASL for authentication on Windows, see
   the following section for additional information and instructions.

Using MapR-SASL for Authentication on Windows

   Drill is automatically configured with MapR security when you install
   Drill 1.11 and later on a MapR 6.x cluster configured with default
   security. To successfully connect to Drill from a Windows ODBC client,
   the MapR client must be installed and a MapR user ticket must exist on
   the Windows client in the %TEMP% directory or in the location specified
   by the $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable.

   The ODBC driver locates user tickets for the current Windows user in
   the default ticket location, %TEMP%, or in the location specified by
   the environment variable, $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION. See [4]Tickets and
   [5]Generating a MapR User Ticket for more information.

   You can either copy a user ticket that was generated on the MapR
   cluster into the default location (%TEMP%), or you can run the
   maprlogin command to generate the ticket on the Windows client.
   If you copy a user ticket that was generated on the MapR cluster, you
   must copy the mapr-clusters.conf file to the client machine. Copy the
   file from /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf to
   C:/opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf on the client machine. Verify that
   the cluster to which the client is connecting is listed as the first
   entry in the mapr-clusters.conf file. Also, if the cluster is secure,
   verify that secure=true for the cluster entry in the file.
   Note: The ODBC user must be the same as the Windows user that created
   the ticket.

   Example
   If you want to connect to Drill as the mapr user, you must create a
   ticket for the mapr user, as shown:
$ maprlogin password -user mapr
[Password for user 'mapr' at cluster 'Cluster1':]

   The MapR credentials for the mapr user in Cluster1 are written to
   /tmp/maprticket_1000.
   Next, place the ticket in the %TEMP% directory on the Windows client.
   For example, the default location for a Windows 10 user named Tabetha
   Stephens is shown:
'C:\Users\TABETH~1\AppData\Local\Temp/maprticket_Tabetha Stephens'

   To override this location, set the "MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION" global
   variable for the Windows user.
   Note: Using the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION is recommended because the
   %TEMP% directory differs between Windows versions. You may also want to
   set the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION per user on the operating system to
   prevent all users from using the same user ticket on the client.
