Drill ODBC Driver

   MapR provides a downloadable Drill ODBC driver that you can use on all
   platforms to connect BI tools, such as Tableau, to Drill.
   The following table provides links to the download locations for the
   MapR Drill ODBC drivers that correlate with each of the Drill versions
   listed:
   Drill Version ODBC Version
   1.15.0        [1]1.3.22.1055
   1.14.0        [2]1.3.22.1055
   1.13.0        [3]1.3.16.1049
   1.12.0        [4]1.3.15.1048
   1.11.0        [5]1.3.15.1046
   1.10.0        [6]1.3.8.1030
   The documentation for the Drill ODBC driver is available at [7]Drill
   ODBC Driver.
   Important: If you plan to use MapR-SASL for authentication on Windows,
   see the following section for additional information and instructions.

Using MapR-SASL for Authentication on Windows

   Drill is automatically configured with MapR security when you install
   Drill 1.11 and later on a MapR 6.x cluster configured with default
   security. To successfully connect to Drill from a Windows ODBC client,
   the MapR client must be installed and a MapR user ticket must exist on
   the Windows client in the %TEMP% directory or in the location specified
   by the $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable.

   The ODBC driver locates user tickets for the current Windows user in
   the default ticket location, %TEMP%, or in the location specified by
   the environment variable, $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION. See [8]Tickets and
   [9]Generating a MapR User Ticket for more information.

   You can either copy a user ticket that was generated on the MapR
   cluster into the default location (%TEMP%), or you can run the
   maprlogin command to generate the ticket on the Windows client.
   If you copy a user ticket that was generated on the MapR cluster, you
   must copy the mapr-clusters.conf file to the client machine. Copy the
   file from /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf to
   C:/opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf on the client machine. Verify that
   the cluster to which the client is connecting is listed as the first
   entry in the mapr-clusters.conf file. Also, if the cluster is secure,
   verify that secure=true for the cluster entry in the file.
   Note: The ODBC user must be the same as the Windows user that created
   the ticket.

   Example
   If you want to connect to Drill as the mapr user, you must create a
   ticket for the mapr user, as shown:
$ maprlogin password -user mapr
[Password for user 'mapr' at cluster 'Cluster1':]

   The MapR credentials for the mapr user in Cluster1 are written to
   /tmp/maprticket_1000.
   Next, place the ticket in the %TEMP% directory on the Windows client.
   For example, the default location for a Windows 10 user named Tabetha
   Stephens is shown:
'C:\Users\TABETH~1\AppData\Local\Temp/maprticket_Tabetha Stephens'

   To override this location, set the "MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION" global
   variable for the Windows user.
   Note: Using the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION is recommended because the
   %TEMP% directory differs between Windows versions. You may also want to
   set the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION per user on the operating system to
   prevent all users from using the same user ticket on the client.
