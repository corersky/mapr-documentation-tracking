Configuring Drill to Use libpam4j

   You can configure Drill to use libpam4j for Plain authentication
   between a client, such as ODBC, and the Drillbit.

   As of Drill 1.13 and MapR 6.0.1 ([1]MEP 5.0), you can configure Drill
   to use libpam4j for form-based authentication between a web client and
   Drillbit (web server). Form-based authentication is like Plain
   authentication in that a user is presented with a web form where s/he
   enters a username and password to access restricted web pages. When
   using form-based authentication, you can also configure Drill to use
   SPNEGO. See [2]SPNEGO for HTTP Authentication.

   Complete the following steps to configure Plain authentication (for
   JDBC/ODBC clients) and form-based authentication (for the web client)
   in Drill:
    1. Add the following configurations to the
       /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf file:
drill.exec:{
   cluster-id:"drillbits1",
   zk.connect:"<zk-node-hostname>:5181,<zk-node-hostname>:5181,<zk-node-hostname
>:5181",
   security:{
      auth.mechanisms:[ "PLAIN"],
   },
   security.user.auth:{
      enabled:true,
      packages += "org.apache.drill.exec.rpc.user.security",
      impl:"pam4j",
      pam_profiles:[ "sudo", "login" ]
   },
   http.auth.mechanisms:[ "FORM" ]
}
    2. (Optional) To add or remove different PAM profiles, add or delete
       the profile names in the pam_profiles array portion of the
       configuration:
pam_profiles: [ "sudo", "login" ]
    3. Restart the Drillbit process on each Drill node, as shown:
/opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/bin/drillbit.sh restart
