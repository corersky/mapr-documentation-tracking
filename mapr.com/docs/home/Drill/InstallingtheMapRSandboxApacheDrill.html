Installing the MapR Sandbox with Drill on VMware Player/VMware Fusion

   Download the MapR Sandbox for Drill and import the virtual machine into
   VirtualBox. Configure the network setting, and start the MapR Sandbox
   for Drill.
   Complete the following steps to install the MapR Sandbox with Drill on
   VMware Player or VMware Fusion:
    1. Download the MapR Sandbox for Drill file to a directory on your
       machine. To access the file, go to
       [1]https://package.mapr.com/releases/, and select the directory for
       the latest MapR release. The file is located in the sandbox/
       directory for the release, as shown:
       [2]https://package.mapr.com/releases/v6.0.0/sandbox/MapR-Sandbox-Fo
       r-Apache-Drill-1.11.0-6.0.0-vmware.ova
    2. Open the virtual machine player, and select the Open a Virtual
       Machine option. If you are running VMware Fusion, select Import.
    3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the MapR Sandbox
       with Drill file, and select
       MapR-Sandbox-For-Apache-Drill-<version>-vmware.ova. The Import
       Virtual Machine dialog appears.
    4. Click Import. The virtual machine player imports the sandbox.
    5. Select Edit virtual machine settings and then select the Network
       Adapter option.
       Note: The correct setting depends on your network connectivity when
       you run the sandbox. In general, if you are going to use a wired
       Ethernet connection, select NAT. If you use ODBC or JDBC on a
       remote host, select Bridged Adapter. If you are going to use a
       wireless network, select Host-only.
    6. Click OK to save the settings.
    7. Select MapR-Sandbox-For-Apache-Drill-<version>_VM, and click Play
       virtual machine.
    8. When you see the maprdemo login:_ prompt, enter mapr and then enter
       mapr as the password.
       The message, Welcome to your MapR Demo virtual machine, appears.
    9. The client must be able to resolve the actual hostname of the Drill
       node(s) with the IP(s). Verify that a DNS entry was created on the
       client machine for the Drill node(s). If a DNS entry does not
       exist, create the entry for the Drill node(s).
          + For Windows, create the entry in
            %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.
          + For Linux and Mac, create the entry in /etc/hosts.
       Example: 127.0.1.1 maprdemo
   10. Go to http://localhost:8047 or http://127.0.0.1:8047 to experience
       the Drill Web Console.
       Note: If you used a bridged adapter, the network generates and
       assigns an IP to the sandbox that you use in place of 127.0.0.1 or
       localhost. To get the IP address, enter root as the username and
       mapr as the password from the sandbox command line. Run the
       ifconfig command to get the sandbox IP address. The IP address is
       located in the inet address field. You can access the Drill Web
       Console using the IP address and port 8047, as shown in the
       following example:
http://10.250.56.216:8047
       You can access the command line on the virtual machine by pressing
       Alt+F2 on Windows or Option+F5 on Mac. You can access the sandbox
       via SSH, as described in [3]Getting to Know the Drill Sandbox

   After downloading and installing the sandbox, continue with the
   tutorial by [4]Getting to Know the Drill Setup.
