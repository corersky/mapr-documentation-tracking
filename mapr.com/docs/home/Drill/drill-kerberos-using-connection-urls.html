Connection URLs for Kerberos using JDBC Drivers to connect via SQLLine

   You can use client-side connection URL parameters for Kerberos
   authentication in multiple combinations to authenticate a client with
   Drill.

Client Credentials

   A client can provide its credentials in two ways:
     * With a ticket granting ticket (TGT) generated on client side. The
       TGT must be present on client node; Drill does not generate the
       TGT.
     * With a keytab file and the client principal provided in the user
       property of the connection URL.

Configuration Options

   The following table lists configuration options for connection URLs.
   See the Connection URL Examples section for sample URLs.
   Connection Parameter (Apache Drill JDBC Driver) Connection Parameter
   (MapR Drill JDBC Driver) Description Mandatory/Optional Default Value
   auth AuthMech Authentication mechanism. The value is deduced if not
   specified. Kerberos if principal is provided. Plain if a user and
   password is provided. A Drill client can also explicitly specify a
   particular authentication mechanism to use using this parameter. For
   example, for Kerberos along with service_name, service_host or
   principal and for the Plain authentication with username and password.
   Optional The preference order is Kerberos and Plain.
   principal KrbPrincipal Drillbit service principal. The format of the
   principal is primary/instance@realm. For Kerberos, the Drill service
   principal is derived if the value is not provided using this
   configuration. service_name (primary) and service_host (instance) are
   used to generate a valid principal. Since the ticket or keytab contains
   the realm information, the realm is optional. Optional
   keytab KrbKeytab For Kerberos, if the client chooses to authenticate
   using a keytab rather than a ticket, set the keytab parameter to the
   location of the keytab file. The client principal must be provided
   through the user parameter. A Kerberos ticket is used as the default
   credential (It is assumed to be present on client-side. The Drill
   client does not generate the required credentials.) Optional
   sasl_encrypt sasl_encrypt When set to true, ensures that a client
   connects to a server with encryption capabilities. For example, Drill
   1.11 drillbits, which support client-to-drillbit encryption. Optional
   FALSE
   service_name KrbServiceName Primary name of the Drillbit service
   principal. Optional drill
   service_host KrbHostFQDN Instance name of the Drillbit service
   principal. Optional Since this value is usually the hostname of the
   node where a drillbit is running, the default value is the drillbit
   hostname is provided either through ZooKeeper or through a direct
   connection string.
   realm KrbRealm Kerberos realm name for the drillbit service principal.
   The ticket or keytab contains the realm information. Optional

Client Encryption

   A client can specify that it requires a server with encryption
   capabilities only by setting the
   sasl_encrypt connection parameter to "true." If the cluster to which
   client is connecting has encryption disabled, the client will fail to
   connect to that server.
drill.exec {
 security:  {
      user.auth.enabled: true,
      auth.mechanisms: ["KERBEROS"],
      auth.principal: "drill/serverhostname@REALM.COM",
      auth.keytab: "/etc/drill/conf/drill.keytab",
      user.encryption.sasl.enabled: true
          }
}

Connection URL Examples

   The following five examples show the JDBC connection URL that the
   embedded JDBC client uses for Kerberos authentication. The first
   section, Example of a Simple Connection URL, includes a simple
   connection string and the second section, Examples of Connection URLs
   Used with Previously Generated TGTs, includes examples to use with
   previously generated TGTs.

   Example of a Simple Connection URL

   Example 1: TGT for Client Credentials
   The simplest way to connect using Kerberos is to generate a TGT on the
   client side. Only specify the service principal in the JDBC connection
   string for the Drillbit the user wants to connect to.
jdbc:drill:drillbit=10.10.10.10;principal=<principal for host 10.10.10.10>

   In this example, the Drill client uses the:
     * Default service_name, which is drill.
     * service_host from the drillbit name provided in the connection URL,
       which is 10.10.10.10.

   The service principal format is <primary>/<instance>@<realm from TGT>.
   The service principal is principal for host 10.10.10.10.

   Examples of Connection URLs Used with Previously Generated TGTs

   If you do not provide a service principal in the connection string when
   using Kerberos authentication, then use the service_name or
   service_host parameters. Since these parameters are optional, their
   default values will be used internally (if not provided) to create a
   valid principal.
   Examples 2 through 4 show a valid connection string for Kerberos
   authentication if a client has previously generated a TGT. Realm
   information will be extracted from the TGT if it is not provided.
   Note: For end-to-end authentication to function, it is assumed that the
   proper principal for the Drillbit service is configured in the KDC.

   Example 2: Drillbit Provided by Direct Connection String and Configured
   with a Unique Service Principal

   This type of connection string is used when:
     * Each Drillbit in the cluster is configured with its own service
       principal.
     * The instance component is the host address of the Drillbit.
       jdbc:drill:drillbit=host1;auth=kerberos

   In this example, the Drill client uses the:
     * Default service_name, which is drill.
     * service_host, which is the drillbit name provided in the connection
       URL (host1).

   The internally created service principal will be drill/host1@<realm
   from TGT>.

   Example 3: Drillbit Selected by ZooKeeper and Configured with Unique
   Service Principal
   This type of connection string is used when the Drillbit is chosen by
   ZooKeeper instead of directly from the connection string.
jdbc:drill:zk=host01.aws.lab:5181;auth=kerberos;service_name=myDrill

   In this example, the Drill client uses the:
     * Provided service_name, which is myDrill as the primary name of the
       principal.
     * service_host as the address of the drillbit, which is chosen from
       the list of active drillbits that ZooKeeper provides
       (host01.aws.lab:5181).

   The internally created service principal will be myDrill/<host address
   from zk>@<realm from TGT>.

   Example 4: Drillbit Selected by Zookeeper and Configured with a Common
   Service Principal
   This type of connection string is used when all Dillbits in a cluster
   use the same principal.
jdbc:drill:zk=host01.aws.lab:5181;auth=kerberos;service_name=myDrill;service_hos
t=myDrillCluster

   In this example, the Drill client uses the:
     * Provided service_name, which is myDrill.
     * service_host, which is myDrillCluster.

   The internally created service principal, which will be
   myDrill/myDrillCluster@<realm from TGT>.

   Example 5: Keytab for Client Credentials
   If a client chooses to provide its credentials in a keytab instead of a
   TGT, it must also provide a principal in the user parameter. In this
   case, realm information will be extracted from the /etc/krb5.conf file
   on the node if it is not provided in the connection URL. All other
   parameters can be used as shown in the preceding examples (1-4). This
   connection string is for the case when all drillbits in a cluster use
   the same principal.
jdbc:drill:zk=host01.aws.lab:5181;auth=kerberos;service_name=myDrill;service_hos
t=myDrillCluster;keytab=<path to keytab file>;user=<client principal>

   In this example, the Drill client:
     * Will authenticate itself with the:
          + Keytab (path to keytab file) and
          + Principal provided in the user parameter (client principal)
     * Uses the:
          + Provided service_name, which is myDrill.
          + service_host, which is myDrillCluster.

   The internally created service principal will be
   myDrill/myDrillCluster@<realm from krb5.conf>.
