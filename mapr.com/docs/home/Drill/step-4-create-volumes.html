Step 4: Create Volumes

   Volumes organize data and manage cluster performance. Create and mount
   a volume to each of the topologies (Drill clusters) you created.

   For example, you can create a volume named “operational” and mount it
   to the T1 topology and then create a volume named “analytical” and
   mount it to the T2 topology.

   See [1]Administering Volumes for volume information and [2]Creating a
   Volume for instructions.

   Once you create the volumes, you now have a place where you can create
   directories and store data. For example, you can create and store
   operational data in the /operational/data/here directory and analytical
   data in the /analytical/data/here directory.

   The directories in which you store your data are the directories you
   use to configure the workspaces in the Drill dfs storage plugin
   configuration.
