Additional Drill-on-YARN Configuration Options

   You can include additional configuration options in the
   $DRILL_SITE/drill-on-yarn.conf file for specialized cases. For example,
   you can customize the Application Master web UI port or Application
   Master settings.

   Refer to the drill-on-yarn-example.conf file in $DRILL_HOME/conf to see
   examples of the additional options. Do not use the example file.
   The following list describes the changes that you can make for several
   of the Drill-on-YARN components:

   Application Name
          You can customize the application name that appears when
          starting or stopping the Drill cluster and in the Drill-on-YARN
          web UI. Change the value of the following option to a name you
          prefer:

app-name: "My Drill Cluster"

   Application Master Web UI Port
          If you run multiple Drill clusters in a YARN cluster, YARN may
          assign two Drill Application Master processes on the same node.
          To avoid port conflicts, change the HTTP port for one or both of
          the Drill clusters. Change the value of the following option to
          a different port number:

drill.yarn:
 http: {
   port: 12345
 }
}

   Application Master Settings
          You can customize certain Application Master properties. All of
          the Application Master properties are prefixed with
          drill.yarn.am, for example drill.yarn.am.heap.

          The following table lists the Application Master properties with
          their default settings:

   CAPTION:

         Name      Description                                           Default
         memory-mb Memory, in MB, to allocate to the Application Master. 14336
         vcores    Number of CPUS to allocate to the Application Master. 1
         heap      Java heap for the Application Master.                 450M

   Drillbit
          You can customize certain properties that control the drillbit
          processes. All of the drillbit properties are prefixed with
          drill.yarn.drillbit, for example drill.yarn.drillbit.disks.

          Note: You can specify Drill disk usage to YARN, however Drill
          uses all disks regardless of the setting.

          The following table lists the drillbit properties with their
          default settings:

   CAPTION:

   Name Description Default
   code-cache Code cache that holds classes generated at runtime. 1G
   memory-mb Memory, in MB, to allocate to the Drillbit. 13000
   vcores Number of CPUS to allocate to the AM. 4
   disks Number of disk equivalents consumed by Drill (on versions of YARN
   that support disk resources.) 1
   heap Java heap memory. 4G
   max-direct-memory Direct (off-heap) memory for the drillbit. 4G
   log-gc Enables Java garbage collector logging. false
   class-path Additional class-path entries. blank
