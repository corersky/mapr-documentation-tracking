Connecting Drill to Data Sources

   Drill serves as a query layer that connects to data sources through
   storage plugins. A storage plugin is a software module for connecting
   Drill to data sources. A storage plugin typically optimizes execution
   of Drill queries, provides the location of the data, and configures the
   workspace and file formats for reading data.

   Several storage plugins are installed with Drill that you can configure
   to suit your environment. Through a storage plugin, Drill connects to a
   data source, such as a database, a file on a local or distributed file
   system, or a Hive metastore. See the [1]Drill Storage and Format Plugin
   Support Matrix.

   You can modify the default configuration of a storage plugin and give
   the new configuration a unique name. This document refers to Y as a
   different storage plugin, although it is actually just a
   reconfiguration of original interface.

   On the Storage tab of the Web Console, you can view and reconfigure a
   storage plugin if you have permission. You can access each node running
   a Drillbit by starting the Drill Web Console. The way you [2]start the
   Drill Web Console depends on your security setup.

   When you install Drill using the mapr-drill package, storage plugin
   configurations are available for the following data sources:
     * MapR Filesystem
     * [3]MapR Database
       Note: To access MapR Database tables, use the dfs storage plugin
       with the [4]maprdb format plugin.
     * [5]Hive
     * [6]Kafka
       Note: As of MapR 6.0 and Drill 1.11, HBase is no longer supported,
       therefore the communication path between Drill and HBase is also
       not supported. If you have an hbase storage plugin configured in
       Drill, you should disable it.

   The Drill documentation describes the [7]attributes and definitions
   that you can configure for storage plugins, except for the MapR
   Database format, which is included only with Drill for MapR. See
   [8]MapR Database Format Plugin for Drill.
   The Drill Web Console includes some default storage plugin
   configurations. The following table lists the default configurations
   and their descriptions:

   CAPTION:

   Instance Description
   cp Points to a JAR file in the Drill classpath that contains the
   Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) benchmark schema TPC-H
   that you can query.
   dfs Points to MapR Filesystem by default. Drill automatically
   configures this instance when you install Drill in a MapR cluster.
   Includes a maprdb format plugin for MapR Database.
   hive Integrates Drill with the Hive metadata abstraction of files, MapR
   Database, and libraries to read data and operate on SerDes and UDFs.

   When you add or update a storage plugin configuration on one Drill node
   in a Drill cluster, Drill broadcasts the information to all of the
   other Drill nodes. All nodes have identical storage plugin
   configurations. You do not need to restart any Drillbits when you add
   or update a storage plugin configuration.h

Configuring Storage Plugin Instances

   You can add, remove, or update Drill storage plugin configurations
   using the Web Console. The following image shows the default storage
   plugin configurations in the Drill Web UI:

   If you click Update next to dfs, the following default configuration
   appears :
{
  "type": "file",
  "enabled": true,
  "connection": "maprfs:///",
  "workspaces": {
    "root": {
      "location": "/",
      "writable": false,
      "defaultInputFormat": null
    },
    "tmp": {
      "location": "/tmp",
      "writable": true,
      "defaultInputFormat": null
    }
  },
  "formats": {
    "psv": {
      "type": "text",
      "extensions": [
         "tbl"
      ],
      "delimiter": "|"
    },
    "csv": {
      "type": "text",
      "extensions": [
        "csv"
      ],
      "delimiter": ","
    },
    "tsv": {
      "type": "text",
      "extensions": [
        "tsv"
      ],
      "delimiter": "\t"
    },
    "parquet": {
      "type": "parquet"
    },
    "json": {
      "type": "json"
    },
    "maprdb": {
      "type": "maprdb"
    }
  }
}

   The dfs configuration includes the storage plugin type, connection
   information, default workspaces, and file formats that the data source
   supports. You can add and remove workspaces and file formats.

Changing the Connection Attribute

   You can also change the connection if you want the configuration to
   point to a different cluster.

   By default, Drill connects to the cluster that the Drill node belongs
   to. You do not need to modify the connection unless you want to connect
   Drill to a different cluster. To connect to a different cluster, edit
   the connection to include the name of the cluster that you want to
   connect to.
   Example:
"connection": "maprfs://<cluster_name>/"
