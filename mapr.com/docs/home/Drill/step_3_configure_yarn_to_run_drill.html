Step 3: Configure YARN to Run Drill

   YARN default settings are optimized for MapReduce applications.
   MapReduce applications use a limited amount of memory; however, Drill
   is long-running and consumes a significant amount of resources. Adjust
   the YARN memory configuration to allow YARN to allocate containers
   large enough to run Drill. Exclude the YARN container directory from
   systemd-tmpfiles to prevent systemd-tmpfiles from removing Drill’s
   container files while Drill runs.

Increase Maximum Container Size

   YARN provides a number of parameters to control the amount of resources
   available to applications. The MapR distribution of YARN sets most of
   these parameters automatically, except for the maximum container size,
   which is left at the Apache YARN default of 8 GB. Typical Drill
   configurations use significantly more memory. Therefore, you must
   increase the YARN maximum container size on each node to suit the needs
   of Drill. You can use the YARN Resource Manager web UI to determine the
   amount of memory available on each node.
   Note: YARN resource requirements match the Drill resource requirements.
   To increase the maximum container size, determine the required
   container size from the Drill setting in drill-on-yarn.conf, which you
   previously set in step 2:
drillbit: {
   memory-mb: 14336
 }

   Use this number to set the yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb
   parameter in /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-<version>/etc/hadoop.<version>,
   substituting the number of the version you have installed.
   Edit yarn-site.xml to add the following:
<property>
   <name>yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb</name>
   <value>14336</value>
   <description>Set to allow Drill containers 14G.</description>
 </property>

   Note: You must update this configuration on every YARN node.

   Restart the YARN Resource Manager to pick up change, and use the YARN
   Resource Manager UI to verify that the maximum container size shows the
   new value.

Exclude the YARN Container Directory from systemd-tmpfiles

   MapR puts the YARN Node Manager container files in the /tmp directory.
   Most system administrators configure systemd-tmpfiles to periodically
   remove files in /tmp. Since Drill-on-YARN is a long-running YARN
   application, systemd-tmpfiles can remove Drill’s container files while
   Drill runs. If this occurs, you must manually shut down the Drill
   cluster because systemd-tmpfiles will have removed the pid file that
   YARN needs to manage Drill.
   You can prevent systemd-tmpfiles from cleaning up Drill's container
   files by adding a new configuration file to /etc/tmpfiles.d/, for
   example /etc/tmpfiles.d/exclude-nm-local-dir.conf, with the following
   configuration:
x /tmp/hadoop-mapr/nm-local-dir/*

   Note: This configuration prevents systemd-tmpfiles from cleaning the
   /nm-local-dir directory when cleaning /tmp.
   Example
$ cat /etc/tmpfiles.d/exclude-nm-local-dir.conf
x /tmp/hadoop-mapr/nm-local-dir/*
