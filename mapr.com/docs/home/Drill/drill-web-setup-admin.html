Setting up Web UI Administrators and Administrator-User Groups

   The security.admin.user_groups and security.admin.users options set the
   administrative users when authentication is enabled.

   Users listed in security.admin.users and the users belonging to the
   groups listed in security.admin.user_groups get administrative
   privileges. By default, these options are set to the username and
   groups of the user who started the Drill process. You can modify these
   options from the Drill Web UI or using the [1]ALTER SYSTEM command.

   An administrative user that authenticates to a Drillbit through
   MapRSASL, Kerberos, Plain mechanism or through the HTTPS web interface
   can modify the security.admin.user_groups and security.admin.users
   options. The administrator can add or remove user names or user groups.

   The security.admin.user_groups and security.admin.users options allow a
   single user/group name or a comma separated list of user/group names.
   When you view these options in the Drill Web UI, dummy default strings
   appear until the user explicitly changes the values.

   Authenticated administrative users can view the current administrative
   user and administrative user groups on the Drill Web UI landing page
   (https://<node-ip-address>:8047) in the Encryption Info section.
