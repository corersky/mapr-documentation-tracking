Drill-on-YARN Limitations

   Drill-on-YARN has the following limitations:

   Hanging requests
          Drill-on-YARN and YARN “hang” if YARN cannot fulfill a container
          request. YARN provides no information about why a request
          “hangs.”

   /tmp directory
          The default MapR YARN settings cause Drillbits to become
          unmanaged within a short amount of time due to a /tmp directory
          issue. See the Exclude the YARN Container Directory from
          tmpwatch section in [1]Step 3: Configure YARN to Run Drill for
          information on how to resolve the issue.

   Container size
          The default MapR YARN settings do not allow a default Drill
          cluster to run due to the default YARN container size. See the
          Increase Maximum Container Size section in [2]Step 3: Configure
          YARN to Run Drill for information on how to resolve the issue.

   Drill disk usage
          You can specify Drill disk usage to YARN, but Drill will use all
          disks regardless of the setting. There is no effective way to
          manage a Drill cluster that:

          + resizes based on load.
          + is rack-aware in its smaller state.

          YARN chooses arbitrary nodes perhaps resulting in large network
          reads. (MD-1028, MD-1089)

   Node Labels
          Although the Apache YARN documentation states that you can
          associate node labels with YARN container requests, MapR has
          found that the feature does not work in practice. While
          Drill-on-YARN configuration has settings to associate Drillbit
          container requests with node labels, doing so is not supported
          in the 1.8 release. To use node labels, associate node labels
          with YARN queues as described in the YARN configuration step in
          the Migrate Drill to Run Under YARN documenation.
