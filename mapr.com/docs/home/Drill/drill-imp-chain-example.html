Example: Impersonation and Chaining

   Frank is a senior HR manager at a company. Frank has access to all of
   the employee data because he is a member of the hr group. Frank created
   a table named “employees” in his home directory to store the employee
   data he uses. Only Frank has access to this table.
drwx------ frank:hr /user/frank/employees

   Each record in the employees table consists of the following
   information: emp_id, emp_name, emp_ssn, emp_salary, emp_addr,
   emp_phone, emp_mgr
   Frank needs to share a subset of this information with Joe who is an HR
   manager reporting to Frank. To share the employee data, Frank creates a
   view called emp_mgr_view that accesses a subset of the data. The
   emp_mgr_view filters out sensitive employee information, such as the
   employee social security numbers, and only shows data for the employees
   that report directly to Joe. Frank and Joe both belong to the mgr
   group. Managers have read permission on Frank’s directory.
rwxr----- frank:mgr /user/frank/emp_mgr_view.view.drill

   The emp_mgr_view.view.drill file contains the following view
   definition:
(view definition: SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary, emp_addr, emp_phone FROM
`/user/frank/employee` WHERE emp_mgr = 'Joe')

   When Joe issues SELECT * FROM emp_mgr_view, Drill impersonates Frank
   when accessing the employee data, and the query returns the data that
   Joe has permission to see based on the view definition. The query
   results do not include any sensitive data because the view protects
   that information. If Joe tries to query the employees table directly,
   Drill returns an error or null values.

   Because Joe has read permissions on the emp_mgr_view, he can create new
   views from it to give other users access to the employee data even
   though he does not own the employees table and cannot access the
   employees table directly.
   Joe needs to share employee contact data with his direct reports, so he
   creates a special view called emp_team_view to share the employee
   contact information with his team. Joe creates the view and writes it
   to his home directory. Joe and his reports belong to a group named
   joeteam. The joeteam group has read permissions on Joe’s home directory
   so they can query the view and create new views from it.
rwxr----- joe:joeteam /user/joe/emp_team_view.view.drill

   The emp_team_view.view.drill file contains the following view
   definition:
(view definition: SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_phone FROM `/user/frank/emp_mgr_v
iew.drill`);

   When anyone on Joe’s team issues SELECT * FROM emp_team_view, Drill
   impersonates Joe to access the emp_team_view and then impersonates
   Frank to access the emp_mgr_view and the employee data. Drill returns
   the data that Joe’s team has can see based on the view definition. If
   anyone on Joe’s team tries to query the emp_mgr_view or employees table
   directly, Drill returns an error or null values.

   Because Joe’s team has read permissions on the emp_team_view, they can
   create new views from it and write the views to any directory for which
   they have write access. Creating views can continue until Drill reaches
   the maximum number of impersonation hops.
