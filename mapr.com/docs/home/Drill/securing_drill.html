Securing Drill

   An administrator can install Drill with the default security
   configuration provided by MapR or manually configure custom security
   for Drill.

   Drill supports several security features that secure the communication
   paths between Drill clients (such as[1] ODBC/JDBC) and Drillbits and
   also between Drillbits. The following sections briefly describe the
   security configuration options for Drill and provide links to
   additional information and instructions.

MapR Default Security Configuration

   Starting in MapR 6.0 and Drill 1.11 ([2]MEP 4.0), Drill is
   automatically secured when you install Drill on a MapR cluster that was
   installed with the default MapR security configuration. The default
   MapR security configuration provides authentication, authorization, and
   encryption through the MapR-SASL mechanism, except for HTTPS, which
   uses [3]SSL/TLS with form-based authentication.
   Note: The default MapR security configuration does not include Kerberos
   or Plain authentication, however you can manually configure these
   security mechanisms in addition to the default MapR security
   configuration.

   See [4]Drill Default Security and [5]SSL/TLS for Encryption for more
   information. You may also want to reference [6]Installing Drill, which
   describes some Drill installation security scenarios.

Security Features Supported in a Custom Configuration

   Drill supports several security features that an [7]administrator can
   manually configure to secure the communication paths between the Drill
   client, such as ODBC and JDBC, and Drillbit and also between Drillbits.
   See [8]Drill Drivers for ODBC and JDBC driver information.
   The following table lists the security features and mechanisms
   supported by Drill, as well as the communication paths secured by each
   mechanism:
   Security Features Supported Mechanisms Communication Paths Secured
   Authentication [9]MapR Security (MapR-SASL/Tickets)
     * Drill client to Drillbit
     * Drillbit to Drillbit
     * Drillbit to ZooKeeper
       Note: The Drillbit creates znodes, for which ZooKeeper ACLs provide
       security. See [10]Security Between ZooKeeper and Drillbits for more
       information.

     [11]Kerberos
     * Drill client to Drillbit
     * Drillbit to Drillbit

     [12]Plain (username and password)
     * Drill client to Drillbit

     [13]Form-based
     * Web client/REST API to Drillbit

   Note: You can configure SSL/TLS for encryption.
     [14]SPNEGO for HTTP
     * Web client/REST API to Drillbit

   Note: You can configure SSL/TLS for encryption.
   Ecryption [15]MapR Security (MapR-SASL/Tickets)
     * Drill client to Drillbit
     * Drillbit to Drillbit

     [16]Kerberos
     * Drill client to Drillbit
     * Drillbit to Drillbit

     [17]SSL/TLS
     * Drill client to Drillbit
     * Web client/REST API to Drillbit

   Authorization Based on file system permissions.
     * Drill client to Drillbit

   Impersonation [18]User Impersonation
     * Drill client to Drillbit

   Note: Drill supports user impersonation, inbound impersonation, and
   user impersonation with Hive authorization.

Views and File ACEs

   In additiona to the listed security features, you can [19]create views
   on data to limit access to data. You can also create [20]file ACEs on
   the view definition files to protect the views.
