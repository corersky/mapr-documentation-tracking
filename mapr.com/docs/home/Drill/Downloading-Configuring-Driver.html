Downloading and Configuring the Driver

   This topic provides instructions for downloading and configuring the
   Drill JDBC driver for SQuirreL.

   When you configure the driver, you define the driver and create an
   alias. The alias is a specific instance of the driver configuration.
   SQuirreL uses the driver definition and alias to connect to Drill so
   you can access data sources that you have registered with Drill. When
   you create the alias, you provide a connection URL that includes the
   name of the Drill directory stored in ZooKeeper and the cluster ID. The
   URL has the following format:
jdbc:drill:zk=<zookeeper_quorum>/<drill_directory_in_zookeeper>/<cluster_ID>

   The following example shows a URL for Drill installed on a single node:
jdbc:drill:zk=10.10.100.56:5181/drill/demo_mapr_com-drillbits
jdbc:drill:zk=10.10.100.24:2181/drill/drillbits1

   The following example shows a URL for Drill installed in distributed
   mode with a connection to a ZooKeeper quorum:
jdbc:drill:zk=10.10.100.30:5181,10.10.100.31:5181,10.10.100.32:5181/drill/drillb

   Note:
     * The ZooKeeper port is 2181. In a MapR cluster, the ZooKeeper port
       is 5181.
     * The Drill directory stored in ZooKeeper is /drill.
     * The Drill default cluster ID is drillbits1. To determine the
       cluster ID, check the following file:
<drill-installation>/conf/drill-override.conf
       For example:
... drill.exec: { cluster-id: "docs41cluster-drillbits", zk.connect: "centos23.l
ab:5181,centos28.lab:5181,centos29.lab:5181" } ...

   To use the Drill JDBC driver with SQuirreL, complete the following
   steps:
    1. [1]Download the latest Drill JDBC Driver and then unzip the file.
       The Drill JDBC Driver JAR files must exist in a directory on your
       machine before you can configure the driver in the SQuirreL client.
    2. If using the MapR-SASL or Plain authentication mechanism, add the
       Drill JDBC JAR files and /opt/mapr/lib/* to Squirrelâ€™s classpath,
       as shown in the following example when the path to the driver is
       C:\driver\MapRDrillJDBC41-1.5.6.1012:
-cp "%SQUIRREL_CP%;C:\driver\MapRDrillJDBC41-1.5.6.1012\*;C:\opt\mapr\lib\*"
       Note: The driver JAR files should appear before /opt/mapr/lib/* in
       the classpath.
    3. Define the driver.
         a. Open the SQuirreL client.
         b. In the SQuirreL toolbar, select Drivers > New Driver. The Add
            Driver dialog appears.
         c. Enter the following information:
               o Name - Name for the Drill JDBC Driver
               o Example URL - jdbc:drill:zk=<zookeeper_quorum>
                 Example: jdbc:drill:zk=maprdemo:5181
               o Website URL - jdbc:drill:zk=<zookeeper_quorum>
                 Example: jdbc:drill:zk=maprdemo:5181
                 Example:
                 jdbc:drill:zk=10.10.100.113:5181,10.10.100.115:5181
         d. Select Extra Class Path, and click Add.
         e. Navigate to the directory that contains the JDBC JAR files.
         f. Select all of the files in the directory, and click Choose.
         g. In the Class Name drop-down field, select
            com.mapr.drill.jdbc41.Driver. Type
            com.mapr.drill.jdbc41.Driver in the field if the option does
            not appear.
         h. Click Ok. The SQuirreL client displays a message stating that
            the driver registration is successful, and you can see the
            driver in the Drivers panel.
    4. Create a database alias.
         a. Select the Aliases tab.
         b. In the SQuirreL toolbar, select Aliases > New Alias. The Add
            Alias dialog box appears.
         c. Enter the following information and click Ok.
               o Alias Name - A unique name for the Drill JDBC Driver
                 alias
               o Driver - Select the Drill JDBC Driver
               o URL - Enter the connection URL with the name of the Drill
                 directory stored in ZooKeeper and the cluster ID.
               o User Name - admin
               o Password - admin
            The Connect to: dialog appears.
         d. Click Connect. SQuirreL displays a message stating that the
            connection is successful.
         e. Click Ok. SQuirrel is connected to Drill through the Drill
            JDBC driver. You can run your queries.
