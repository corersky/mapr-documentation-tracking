Determining Index Use

   Evaluate the query plan to analyze query performance and determine if
   Drill uses indexes. You can view query plans in the Drill Web Console
   or through the command line using the EXPLAIN command. You can also
   disable the indexing option in Drill and compare an index-based plan to
   a full table scan plan.

   Drill leverages indexes during the physical planning phase of the
   query. Drill estimates the cost of an index-based plan and a plan that
   includes a full table scan. See [1]Selection and Execution of Secondary
   Indexes for information about how Drill selects a query plan. In cases
   where Drill does not select the index-based plan and instead selects a
   full table scan plan, you may want to remove the indexes to free up
   storage space and eliminate the overhead of the indexes.

   The following example shows you how to determine if Drill selected an
   index-based plan for a query through the query profile in the Drill Web
   Console and the EXPLAIN PLAN FOR output.

Example

   The subsequent sections assume that an index exists on a table named
   "lineitem." The index, l_single_c_5, is a single field index created on
   the L_QUANTITY field. The index also covers the L_SUPPKEY, L_DISCOUNT,
   L_SHIPDate, and L_SHIPMODE fields. If a query contains fields covered
   by the index, the query is a covering query. If a query contains fields
   not covered by the index, the query is non-covering and requires a
   lookup back into the primary table to retrieve data.
   The following list summarizes the assumptions:
     * Table name: lineitem
     * Index name: l_single_c_5
     * Indexed field: L_QUANTITY
     * Included fields: L_SUPPKEY, L_DISCOUNT, L_SHIPDate, L_SHIPMODE

Query Profile

   View the query plan on the Profiles tab in the Drill Web Console. See
   [2]Starting the Web Console. Select the query you want to evaluate and
   then select the Physical Plan tab. You can see the physical plan that
   Drill used to execute the query.
   The following image shows the physical plan that Drill used to execute
   this simple equality query:
SELECT L_SHIPDate FROM lineitem WHERE L_QUANTITY = 5;

   [drill-si-query-plan-simple-rs.png]
   In the plan, you can see that Drill scanned the index, l_single_c_5,
   instead of the primary table. The query was completely covered by the
   index because the index contains all fields referenced in the query and
   the query filtered on the indexed field.

EXPLAIN PLAN

   Alternatively, you can issue the [3]EXPLAIN command to see how Drill
   executes a query. To see the chosen physical execution plan for a query
   without running the query, issue the [4]EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command. This
   command shows you if Drill plans to use the index when executing the
   query.
   The following image shows the physical plan that Drill plans to use to
   execute this simple equality query:
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT L_SHIPDate FROM lineitem WHERE L_QUANTITY = 5 LIMIT 10;
+------+------+
| text | json |
+------+------+
| 00-00    Screen
00-01      Project(L_SHIPDate=[$0])
00-02        SelectionVectorRemover
00-03          Limit(fetch=[10])
00-04            Limit(fetch=[10])
00-05              Project(L_SHIPDate=[$1])
00-06                Scan(groupscan=[JsonTableGroupScan [ScanSpec=JsonScanSpec [
tableName=maprfs:///drill/testdata/tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/lineitem, condition=(L_Q
UANTITY = {"$numberLong":5}), indexName=l_single_c_5], columns=[`L_QUANTITY`, `L
_SHIPDate`]]])

   In the plan, you can see that Drill plans to use the index,
   l_single_c_5, instead of performing a full table scan. The query is
   completely covered by the index because the index contains all fields
   referenced in the query and the query filters on the indexed field.

Compare Plans

   If you want to compare an index-based plan against a plan with a full
   table scan, disable the planner.enable_index_planning option in Drill,
   and run the EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command for the query. Running this
   command with the planner.enable_index_planning option disabled forces
   Drill to generate a plan that includes a full table scan. You can
   compare the full table scan plan against the index-based plan to
   compare the costs and resource consumption of each plan.
   You can see in the following query, with the indexing feature turned
   on, Drill generated a plan using the index:
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT L_SHIPDate FROM lineitem WHERE L_QUANTITY = 5 LIMIT 10;
+------+------+
| text | json |
+------+------+
| 00-00    Screen
00-01      Project(L_SHIPDate=[$0])
00-02        SelectionVectorRemover
00-03          Limit(fetch=[10])
00-04            Limit(fetch=[10])
00-05              Project(L_SHIPDate=[$1])
00-06                Scan(groupscan=[JsonTableGroupScan [ScanSpec=JsonScanSpec [
tableName=maprfs:///drill/testdata/tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/lineitem, condition=(L_Q
UANTITY = {"$numberLong":5}), indexName=l_single_c_5], columns=[`L_QUANTITY`, `L
_SHIPDate`]]])

   If you turn the option off, as shown:
ALTER SESSION SET planner.enable_index_planning = false

   You can run the EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command again to see the plan with a
   full table scan included:
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT L_SHIPDate FROM lineitem WHERE L_QUANTITY = 5 LIMIT 10;
+------+------+
| text | json |
+------+------+
| 00-00    Screen
00-01      Project(L_SHIPDate=[$0])
00-02        SelectionVectorRemover
00-03          Limit(fetch=[10])
00-04            UnionExchange
01-01              SelectionVectorRemover
01-02                Limit(fetch=[10])
01-03                  Project(L_SHIPDate=[$1])
01-04                    Scan(groupscan=[JsonTableGroupScan [ScanSpec=JsonScanSp
ec [tableName=maprfs:///drill/testdata/tpch/sf1/maprdb/json/lineitem, condition=
(L_QUANTITY = {"$numberLong":5})], columns=[`L_QUANTITY`, `L_SHIPDate`]]])
 |

   Note: To see the cost of each plan, go to the Drill Web Console and
   view the query profile for each EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command that you issue
   through the command line.
