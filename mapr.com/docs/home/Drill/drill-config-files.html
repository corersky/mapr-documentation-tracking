Drill Configuration Files

   The Drill installation includes configuration files with start-up
   options that you can modify prior to starting Drill.

   The configuration files reside in a [1]HOCON configuration file format,
   which is a hybrid between a properties file and a JSON file. The files
   have a nested relationship and a hierarchical structure, where one file
   overrides another. You can locate the files in the
   /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf directory.
   The configuration files are listed below in their hierarchical order.
   The drill-distrib.conf file overrides the drill-module.conf file, and
   the drill-override.conf file overrides the drill-distrib.conf file.
     * drill-override.conf
     * drill-distrib.conf
     * drill-module.conf

   Environment variables are also overridden in the same way, in the order
   listed below:
     * drill-env.sh (or explicitly defined in environment)
     * distrib-env.sh
     * drill-config.sh

   The following table lists the configuration files with their
   descriptions:
   File Name Description Default Configuration with Secure Installation
   drill-distrib.conf

   Contains MapR distribution specific configurations for Drill.
   Automatically updated by configure.sh when you configure the MapR
   cluster.
     * Enables authentication, impersonation, and encryption with
       MapR-SASL as the default mechanism.
     * Enables TLS for the HTTPS channel.
       Note: By default, HTTPS uses the SSL certificate provided by the
       MapR installation; however, an administrator can specify a
       certificate in a keystore.
     * Enables the inbound impersonation policy for administrators to
       impersonate any other user.

   distrib-env.sh Contains distribution-specific defaults for various
   environment variables.
     * Enables authentication between the Drillbits and ZooKeeper.
     * Configures the location of the MapR security configuration file,
       mapr.login.conf, used by Drill.

   drill-env.sh The drill-env.sh file contains the cluster
   admininstrator-specific environment variables that can differ from the
   defaults. You can modify this file to override the default values of
   system properties defined in the distrib-env.sh file or to define a new
   system property. Empty upon installation.
   drill-override.conf

   Use the drill-override.conf file to override the default values
   obtained from drill-module.conf and drill-distrib.conf. A cluster
   administrator can update this file to configure a Drillbit as required
   (different from default installation)
   When you first install Drill, drill-override.conf contains ZooKeeper
   and Drillbit configuration information; however, after you run
   configure.sh -R, the entries are removed and the file does not contain
   any configurations.
