Installing the MapR Sandbox with Drill on VirtualBox

   Download the MapR Sandbox for Drill and import the virtual machine into
   VirtualBox. Configure the network setting, and start the MapR Sandbox
   for Drill.
   Note: The MapR Sandbox for Drill on VirtualBox comes with NAT port
   forwarding enabled, which allows you to access the sandbox using
   localhost as the hostname.

   Complete the following steps to install the MapR Sandbox with Drill:
    1. Download the MapR Sandbox for Drill file to a directory on your
       machine. To access the file, go to
       [1]http://package.mapr.com/releases/, and select the directory for
       the latest MapR release. The file is located in the sandbox/
       directory for the release, as shown:
       [2]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v6.0.0/sandbox/MapR-Sandbox-For
       -Apache-Drill-1.11.0-6.0.0.ova
    2. Open VirtualBox, and select File > Import Appliance. The Import
       Appliance window appears.
    3. Go to the directory where you downloaded the MapR Sandbox for Drill
       file, select the MapR-Sandbox-For-Apache-Drill-<version>.ova file,
       and click Next. The Import Virtual Appliance window appears.
    4. In the Import Virtual Appliance window, select the option to
       Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards and then click
       Import. The Import Appliance imports the sandbox.
    5. When the import completes, select the MapR Sandbox for Drill and
       then click Settings. The Settings window appears.
    6. In the Settings window, select Network. The correct setting depends
       on your network connectivity when you run the sandbox. In general,
       if you are going to use a wired Ethernet connection, select NAT
       Network. If you use ODBC or JDBC on a remote host, select Bridged
       Adapter. If you are going to use a wireless network, select
       Host-only Adapter or Bridged Adapter with the Intel(R) Dual Band
       Wireless-AC 8260 option.
    7. Click OK to continue.
    8. Select the MapR-Sandbox-For-Apache-Drill-<version> in VirtualBox,
       and click Start.
    9. When you see maprdemo login:_ prompt, enter mapr and then enter
       mapr as the password.
       The message, Welcome to your MapR Demo virtual machine, appears.
   10. The client must be able to resolve the actual hostname of the Drill
       node(s) with the IP(s). Verify that a DNS entry was created on the
       client machine for the Drill node(s). If a DNS entry does not
       exist, create the entry for the Drill node(s).
          + For Windows, create the entry in
            %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.
          + For Linux and Mac, create the entry in /etc/hosts.
       Example: 127.0.0.1 maprdemo
   11. Go to [3]http://localhost:8047 or http://127.0.0.1:8047 to
       experience the Drill Web Console, and enter mapr as the username
       and password.
       Note: If you used a bridged adapter, the network generates and
       assigns an IP to the sandbox that you use in place of localhost or
       127.0.0.1. To get the IP address, run ifconfig from the sandbox
       command line to get the sandbox IP address. The IP address is
       located in the inet address field. You can access the Drill Web
       Console using the IP address and port 8047, as shown in the
       following example:
http://10.250.56.216:8047
       You can access the command line on the virtual machine by pressing
       Alt+F2 on Windows or Option+F5 on Mac. You can access the sandbox
       via SSH, as described in [4]Getting to Know the Drill Sandbox.

   After downloading and installing the sandbox, continue with the
   tutorial by [5]Getting to Know the Drill Setup.
