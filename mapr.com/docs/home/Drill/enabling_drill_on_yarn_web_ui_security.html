Enabling Application Master Web UI Security

   By default, the Application Master web UI is not secure and open to
   everyone. You can configure user authentication or implement a simple,
   predefined user name and password to secure the UI. Modify the
   drill-on-yarn.conf configuration file to enable Drill-on-YARN security.

   â€‹The following sections describe how to enable security for the
   Application Master web UI.

User Authentication

   You must enable [1]user authentication in Drill if you want
   Drill-on-YARN to use this feature for security purposes. When user
   authentication is enabled, the user name and password must match that
   of the user that started the Drill-on-YARN application.
   To secure the Application Master web UI by way of user authentication,
   modify drill-on-yarn.conf to include the following section with the
   auth-type set to drill:
drill.yarn.http: {
   auth-type: "drill"
}

Simple Security

   Define a username and password in drill-on-yarn.conf and then restart
   the Drill-on-YARN Application Master to implement simple security for
   the Application Master web UI.
   Modify the drill-on-yarn.conf configuration file to include the
   following section, replacing the user-name and password settings with
   yours, and then restar the Drill-on-YARN Application Master:
drill.yarn.http: {
   auth-type: "simple"
   user-name: "bob"
   password: "secret"
}

   When you visit the web UI, a login page prompts you for the username
   and password that you configured. These are the only valid credentials.
