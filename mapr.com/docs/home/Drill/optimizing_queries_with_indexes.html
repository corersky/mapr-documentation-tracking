Optimizing Queries with Indexes

   MapR Database provides a highly scalable key-value database platform on
   which you can run SQL queries using Drill. As of the 6.0 release of the
   MapR Converged Data Platform, MapR Database natively supports indexes
   on secondary fields in JSON tables.
   Note: MapR Database does not support indexes on binary tables.
   An index is a special table that stores a subset of document fields
   from a JSON table. The primary field in a JSON table is the _id field
   (unique key field). By default, MapR Database sorts the JSON table by
   the _id field. All other fields in the JSON table are secondary fields.
   You can create indexes on the secondary fields in a JSON table to
   eliminate full tables scans and significanlty improve query
   performance. See [1]MapR Database as a Document Database and
   [2]Secondary Index Concepts for more information.

Benefits of Indexes

   Well-designed indexes can optimize access to data stored in MapR
   Database JSON tables and improve performance for high read operations,
   fast integrated analytics, and complex operational analytics. See
   [3]Secondary Indexes for more information about the benefits of
   indexes.

Types of Queries that Benefit from Indexes

   Indexes primarily benefit queries with filters in the WHERE clause and
   queries with an ORDER BY clause for sorting, as described in the
   following table:

   CAPTION:

   Query Type Description
   Equality Equality queries contain equality conditions, such as a=1 and
   can also include IN. See [4]Equality Queries.
   Range Range queries contain range conditions, such as <=, >=, and the
   LIKE pattern matching condition. See [5]Range Queries.
   Note: The LIKE operator only works on fields that have varchar data
   types. To use the LIKE operator in queries, use the [6]CAST function to
   explicitly cast fields to varchar. To use indexes for such queries,
   create indexes on the cast expressions, as explained in [7]Using Casts
   in Secondary Indexes.
   ORDER BY ORDER BY queries specify a sort order. If the ordering and
   sorting of the index key list match the ordering specified in a query,
   the optimizer in Drill does not have to sort the data after the index
   scan. See [8]ORDER BY Queries.
   Multi-index Multi-index queries contain conditions on multiple fields.
   Drill can scan multiple indexes and use the intersection of the
   matching documents to optimize these queries. Multi-index queries are
   an alternative to using [9]composite key indexes. See [10]Multi-Index
   Queries.

   Drill can create index plans for queries with and without filters in
   the WHERE clause. For example, Drill can create an index plan for an
   ORDER BY query that does not have filters.
   Drill 1.12 and later also supports the following types of queries
   without filters :
     * GROUP BY
     * JOIN
     * DISTINCT

   See [11]Index Planning in Drill for more information.

Types of Indexes Supported by MapR Database

   MapR Database supports several types of indexes on JSON tables
   including simple, composite, hashed, covering, and indexes with the
   CAST function.
   Note: MapR Database enforces certain [12]restrictions on indexes, such
   as a limit of 32 KB on the collective size of all indexed keys for each
   index. See [13]Restrictions on Secondary Indexes for a full list of
   restrictions and [14]Data Types Supported for Secondary Indexes.
   The following table lists the supported index types with brief
   descriptions and links to topics that provide more information:

   CAPTION:

   Index Type Description
   Simple Simple indexes are indexes with a single indexed field (or key).
   See [15]Simple Indexes.
   Composite Composite indexes are indexes that have more than one indexed
   field (or key). See [16]Composite Indexes.
   Hashed Hashed indexes are indexes that distribute keys across logical
   partitions to avoid the creation of hot spots when MapR Database
   updates the index with new keys from the JSON table. See [17]Hashed
   Indexes.
   Covering A covering index is an index that allows MapR Database to
   process a query using only the secondary indexes. MapR Database does
   not have to read data in the JSON table. See [18]Covering Indexes.
   Indexes with the CAST function Indexes with the CAST function convert
   the indexed field to the data type specified by the CAST function and
   store the results. See [19]Using Casts in Secondary Indexes.

Steps Required to Use Indexes

   To use the index functionality with Drill, complete the following
   steps:
    1. Install the latest version of the required MapR software on the
       cluster. See [20]Preparing Clusters for Querying using Secondary
       Indexes on JSON Tables and Installing Drill.
    2. Evaluate your queries and design indexes that support the queries.
       See [21]Understanding the Secondary Index Workflow and
       [22]Designing Secondary Indexes.
    3. Create indexes on JSON tables in MapR Database. See [23]Adding
       Secondary Indexes on JSON Tables and [24]Managing Secondary
       Indexes.
       Note: The user that creates indexes on a JSON table must have
       created the table or have the indexperm permission in addition to
       readAce on the volume and lookupdir on directories in the table
       path. If you do not have these permissions, consult with your
       system administrator.
    4. Issue queries.
    5. Verify that Drill uses the available indexes. See [25]Determining
       Index Use and Troubleshooting Indexes.
