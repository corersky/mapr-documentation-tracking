Configuring Drill

   Drill is highly configurable. This document focuses on MapR-related
   configurations and refers to the open source [1]Apache Drill
   documentation for generic information. Key things to configure are:

   Drill memory
          Determine the amount of heap and direct memory allocated to a
          Drillbit for query processing in a Drill cluster. See
          [2]Configuring Drill Memory.

   Parquet block size
          Change the Parquet block size to match the MapR-FS chunk size.
          See [3]Configuring the Parquet Block Size.

   Resources for a shared drillbit
          Configure queues and parallelization for supporting multiple
          users sharing a drillbit. Support separate drillbits running on
          different nodes in the cluster. See [4]Configuring Resources for
          a Shared Drillbit.

   Multitenancy
          Configure a multitenant cluster to account for resources
          required for Drill. See [5]Configuring a Multitenant Cluster.

   User Impersonation
          Configure impersonation to allow a service to act on behalf of a
          client while performing the action requested by the client. See
          [6]User Impersonation.

   User authentication and encryption
          Configure user authentication when you want the identity of a
          user proven before the user accesses a process running on a
          system. See [7]MapR Security (Tickets).

   SSL/TLS for Encryption
          Enable and configure SSL/TLS for encryption when you need to use
          Plain authentication. See [8]Using SSL/TLS for Encryption.

   Drill impersonation with Hive authorization
          Configure Drill impersonation to work with Hive impersonation to
          authorize access to metadata in the Hive metastore repository
          and data in the Hive warehouse. See [9]User Impersonation.

   Volumes to use for spooling
          Use the [10]drill.exec.sort.external.spill.directories option to
          set MapReduce volumes or local volumes for spooling to improve
          performance and stripe data across as many disks as possible.

   Persistent configuration storage
          Configure MapR-DB for persistent configuration storage. See
          [11]Persistent Configuration Storage and [12]Configuring
          Persistent Configuration Data.

   Access rights
          Configure access rights if you have 777 file-level permissions
          to a table and a query returns no results. See Configuring
          Access Rights below.

   Drill typically runs along side other workloads, including the
   following:
     * MapReduce
     * Yarn
     * Hive and Pig
     * Spark

   You need to plan and configure these resources for use with Drill and
   other workloads:
     * Memory
     * CPU
     * Disk

Configuring Access Rights

   If the security in your organization limits access to MapR-DB tables,
   you might experience a problem querying the tables. If you have 777
   file-level permissions to a table, yet a query returns no results, you
   might need to add your user name to the maprcli access list (ACL).
