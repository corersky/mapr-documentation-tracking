   Drivers are updated periodically to include support for new
   functionality in Drill.

Driver Limitations

   When using MapR-SASL with JDBC or ODBC drivers, there is no way to
   specify the target cluster name as part of the connection parameters.
   MapR-SASL reads the first entry in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file and assumes it is the target
   cluster name.

   For example, if the mapr-clusters.conf file has an entry for 'cluster1'
   followed by an entry for 'cluster2' and you want to connect to a node
   in 'cluster2', authentication fails. As a workaround, manually switch
   the order of entries in the mapr-clusters.conf file.
