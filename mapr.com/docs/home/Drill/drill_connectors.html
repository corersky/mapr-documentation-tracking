Drill Drivers

   Typically, each Drill release introduces updated JDBC and ODBC drivers
   that include support for new features and functionality in Drill, such
   as authentication and encryption support.
   Note: See [1]Securing Drill for more information about authentication
   and encryption.
   Click the following links to access the latest ODBC and JDBC drivers:
     * [2]ODBC drivers
     * [3]JDBC drivers

   Note: You can download previews of the MapR [4]ODBC and [5]JDBC drivers
   for Drill 1.14. Earlier versions of the drivers do not work with Drill
   1.14.
   Click the following links to access the ODBC and JDBC driver
   documentation:
   Note: Updated driver documentation for Drill 1.14 will be available
   soon.
     * [6]Drill ODBC Driver documentation
     * [7]Drill JDBC Driver documentation

   Note: The [8]Drill JDBC Driver and [9]Drill ODBC Driver topics contain
   some additional information and instructions not included in the
   [10]Drill JDBC Driver and [11]Drill ODBC Driver documentation.

Driver Limitations

   When using MapR-SASL with JDBC or ODBC drivers, there is no way to
   specify the target cluster name as part of the connection parameters.
   MapR-SASL reads the first entry in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file and assumes it is the target
   cluster name.

   For example, if the mapr-clusters.conf file has an entry for 'cluster1'
   followed by an entry for 'cluster2' and you want to connect to a node
   in 'cluster2', authentication fails. As a workaround, manually switch
   the order of entries in the mapr-clusters.conf file.

   The following sections provide additional information and instructions
   for each of the drivers:
