Drill Drivers

   Drill 1.11 introduces updated JDBC and ODBC drivers that feature
   authentication and encryption support. See [1]Securing Drill for more
   information.

   You can download the latest JDBC driver [2]here. The documentation for
   the Drill JDBC 1.5.6 driver is available at .
   You can download the latest ODBC driver [3]here. The documentation for
   the Drill ODBC 1.3.15 driver is available at .
   Note: The [4]Drill JDBC Driver and [5]Drill ODBC Driver topics contain
   some additional information and instructions not included in the and
   documentation.

Driver Limitations

   When using MapR-SASL with JDBC or ODBC drivers, there is no way to
   specify the target cluster name as part of the connection parameters.
   MapR-SASL reads the first entry in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file and assumes it is the target
   cluster name.

   For example, if the mapr-clusters.conf file has an entry for 'cluster1'
   followed by an entry for 'cluster2' and you want to connect to a node
   in 'cluster2', authentication fails. As a workaround, manually switch
   the order of entries in the mapr-clusters.conf file.

   The following sections provide additional information and instructions
   for each of the drivers:
