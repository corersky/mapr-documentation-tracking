Application Master Web UI

   Drill, running as a YARN application, provides the Drill-on-YARN
   Application Master (AM) process to manage the Drill cluster. The Drill
   AM provides a web UI where you can monitor cluster status and perform
   simple operations, such as increasing or decreasing cluster size, or
   stopping the cluster.

   When you launch Drill using the Drill-on-YARN command line tool, the
   tool signals YARN to launch the AM, which in turn launches the
   drillbits in the cluster. When Drill starts, you can access the web UI
   using the URL provided at startup.

   The following sections describe the information that the Application
   Master web UI provides:

Main

   The main page provides the following information about the Drill
   cluster:

   Drill Cluster Status
          The Drill cluster status show the state of the Drill cluster,
          which is one of the following:

          + LIVE: This is the normal state and shows that the Drill
            cluster is running.
          + ENDING: The cluster is in the process of shutting down

          There is no “ENDED.” state. When the cluster shuts down, the web
          UI is no longer available.

   Target Drillbit Count
          The target drillbit count is the number of drillbits to run in
          the cluster. The actual number may be less if drillbits have not
          yet started, or if YARN cannot allocate enough containers.

   Live Drillbit Count
          The live drillbit count is the number of drillbits that are
          ready for use. These have successfully started, have registered
          with ZooKeeper, and are ready for use. You can see the detail of
          all drillbits (including those in the process of starting or
          stopping) using the Drillbits page. Each drillbit must run on a
          separate node, so this is also the number of nodes in the
          cluster running Drill.

   Total Drillbit Memory and Virtual Cores
          The total number of YARN resources currently allocated to
          running drillbits.

   YARN Node Count, Memory, and Virtual Cores
          Reports general information about YARN itself including the
          number of nodes, the total cluster memory, and total number of
          virtual cores.

   Groups
          Lists the cluster groups defined in the configuration file (only
          one is currently supported), along with the target and actual
          number of drillbits in that group.

Configuration

   The configuration page shows the complete set of configuration values
   used for the current run. The values come from the configurations you
   set and the Drill-provided defaults. Use this page to diagnose
   configuration-related issues. Names are shown in fully-expanded form.
   That is the name “drill.yarn.http.port” refers to the parameter
   defined, as follows, in your configuration file:
drill.yarn:
 http: {
   port: 8048
 }
}

Drillbits

   The Drillbits page provides the following information about each of the
   Drillbits:

   ID
          A sequential number assigned to each new Drillbit. Numbers may
          not start with 1 if you have previously shut down some
          drillbits.

   Group
          The cluster group that started the Drillbit. Cluster groups
          configured in drill-on-yarn.conf.

   Host
          The host name or IP address on which the Drillbit runs. If the
          Drillbit is in a normal operating state, this field is also a
          hyperlink to the Web UI for the drillbit.

   State
          The operating state of the Drillbit. The normal state is
          “Running.” The drillbit passes through a number of states as
          YARN allocates a container and launches a process, as the AM
          waits for the Drillbit to become registered in ZooKeeper, and so
          on. Similarly, the Drillbit passes through a different set of
          states during shutdown. Use this value to diagnose problems. If
          the drillbit is in a live state, this field shows an “[X]” link
          that you can use to kill this particular drillbit. Use this if
          the drillbit has startup problems or seems unresponsive. During
          the shut-down process, the kill link disappears and is replaced
          with a “Cancelled” note.

   ZK State
          The ZooKeeper handshake state. Normal state is “START_ACK”,
          meaning that the drillbit has registered with ZooKeeper. This
          state is useful when diagnosing problems.

   Container ID
          The YARN-assigned container ID for the drillbit task. The ID is
          a link that takes you to the YARN Node Manager UI for the
          drillbit task.

   Memory and Virtual Cores (vcores)
          The amount of resources actually allocated to the drillbit by
          YARN.

   Start Time
          The date and time (in your local time-zone, displayed in ISO
          format) when the drillbit launch started. This page also
          displays unmanaged drillbits, if present. An unmanage drillbit
          is one that is running, has registered with ZooKeeper, but was
          not started by the Application Master. Likely, the drillbit was
          launched using the drillbit.sh script directly. Use the host
          name to locate the machine running the Drillbit if you want to
          convert the drillbit to run under YARN.

Manage

   The Manage page provides options to resize or stop the Drill cluster.
   You can resize the cluster by adding or removing drillbits or setting
   the cluster to a specific size.

   Drill is a long-running application. Typlically, Drill runs
   indefinitely, and you would only shut down the Drill cluster to perform
   an upgrade of the Drill software or to change configuration options.
   When you terminate the Drill cluster, any in-progress queries fail.
   Therefore, best practice is to perform the shutdown with users so that
   Drill is not processing any queries at the time of the shut-down.

   When removing or shutting-down the cluster, you receive a confirmation
   page asking if you really do want to stop drillbit processes. Click
   Confirm to continue.

History

   The History page lists all failed, killed, and restarted drillbits. You
   can detect failures and diagnose problems using the information on this
   page. Use the YARN container ID listed on this page to locate the log
   files for the drillbit.
