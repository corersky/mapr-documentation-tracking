Configuring Multiple Drill Clusters within a MapR Cluster and Designating a
Drill Cluster as a OJAI Distributed Query Service Provider

   As of MapR 6.0 and Drill 1.11, you can run operational queries through
   the OJAI Distributed OJAI Distributed Query Service, as well as
   analytical queries through Drill. If you want to run operational and
   analytical workloads in your MapR cluster, you must configure multiple
   Drill clusters within the MapR cluster and then configure a Drill
   cluster as an OJAI Distributed OJAI Distributed Query Service provider.
   Restricting each workload to its own cluster improves query
   performance.
   Note: Installing Drill and the OJAI Distributed OJAI Distributed Query
   Service together through the MapR Installer is not currently supported.
   MapR supports only one of these services running in the cluster unless
   you manually install and configure multiple Drill clusters, as
   instructed here.

Data Distribution

   If you install both Drill and the OJAI Distributed OJAI Distributed
   Query Service through the MapR Installer, both workloads get processed
   across the entire MapR cluster. When both services run together in the
   cluster, the system replicates data across the entire cluster, causing
   remote reads and impairing performance, which can cause missed SLAs and
   memory issues.

Memory Allocation

   The amount of memory allocated to Drill and the OJAI Distributed Query
   Service differ. By default, when you install Drill, 13 GB of memory is
   allocated to the Drillbit service running on a node, as follows:
     * 8 GB direct
     * 4 GB heap
     * 1 GB core cache

   The OJAI Distributed Query Service requires much less memory than
   Drill. By default, the OJAI Distributed Query Service is allocated ~ 5
   GB of memory, as follows:
     * 1 GB direct
     * 3 GB heap
     * 512 MB core cache

   If you install using the MapR Installer and select both Drill and the
   OJAI Distributed Query Service, memory is configured for Drill. If you
   only run operational queries, which do not use as much memory as
   analytical queries, you give up an additional 8 GB of memory
   unnecessarily.

How to Run Drill and the OJAI Distributed Query Service Together in a MapR
Cluster

   You can manually install Drill on several nodes and divide the nodes
   into multiple topologies (Drill clusters). For each of the topologies
   you create and mount a volume. You then create directories within each
   volume to store your data. You configure these directories as
   workspaces in the Drill dsf storage plugin. And finally, you can
   configure any of the Drill clusters to run as a OJAI Distributed Query
   Service provider.
   The following table briefly describes each step required to configure
   multiple Drill clusters and then configure a Drill cluster as a OJAI
   Distributed Query Service provider:

   CAPTION:

   Step Description
   [1]1-Plan the cluster You can create multiple Drill clusters. Decide
   which nodes to include in each cluster, and decide which cluster to use
   as the cluster that you will ultimately configure as the OJAI
   Distributed Query Service provider.
   [2]2-Manually install Drill on all nodes This process does not work if
   you install Drill or the OJAI Distributed Query Service using the MapR
   Installer. You must manually install Drill on each node, regardless of
   what cluster it will belong to. You can install Drill to run under
   Warden or YARN.
   [3]3-Define node topologies Define a node topology for each Drill
   cluster.
   [4]4-Create volumes Create a volume with a mount point for each
   topology. Create a directory within each mount point and copy data into
   the directories.
   [5]5-Configure multiple Drill clusters On each node, update the
   drill-override.conf configuration file to indicate the Drill cluster to
   which the node belongs.
   [6]6-Configure workspaces Create a workspace for each directory where
   data is stored.

   [7]7-Configure a Drill Cluster as a OJAI Distributed Query Service
   Provider
   Run a command to configure a Drill cluster as the OJAI Distributed
   Query Service provider. This cluster will run all of the operational
   queries.
   The following topics provide instructions for each of the required
   steps:
