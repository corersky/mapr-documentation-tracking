Using the Drill JDBC Driver with SQuirreL

   You can use the Drill JDBC driver with SQuirreL to connect to Drill and
   query the data sources configured in Drill.

   To use the Drill JDBC Driver with SQuirreL, verify that your system
   meets the prerequisites and then download and configure the driver.

Prerequisites

   Verify that the system meets the following prerequisites:
     * Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 7.0 or later, installed on
       each machine where you plan to use the JDBC driver.
     * Drill installed in distributed mode on one or multiple nodes in a
       cluster with data sources configured. See [1]Connecting Drill to
       Data Sources.
     * Verify that the system can resolve the hostnames of the ZooKeeper
       nodes of the Drill cluster. You can do this by configuring DNS for
       all of the systems. Alternatively, you can edit the hosts file to
       include the hostnames and IP addresses of all the ZooKeeper nodes
       used with the Drill cluster.
          + For Windows, create the entry in the
            %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.
          + For Linux and Mac, create the entry in /etc/hosts.
            Example: 127.0.1.1 maprdemo
