User Impersonation

   Impersonation allows a service to act on behalf of a client while
   performing the action requested by the client. By default, user
   impersonation is disabled in Drill. You can configure user
   impersonation in the
   /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/drill-override.conf file.

   When you enable impersonation, Drill executes all the client requests
   as the user logged in to the client. Drill passes the user credentials
   to the file system, and the file system checks to see if the user has
   permission to access the data. When you enable authentication, Drill
   uses the pluggable authentication module (PAM) to authenticate a userâ€™s
   identity before the user can access the Drillbit process.

   If impersonation is disabled, Drill executes all of the client requests
   against the file system as the user that started the Drillbit service
   on the node. This is typically a privileged user. The file system
   verifies that the system user has permission to access the data.

User Impersonation Example

   When impersonation is disabled and user Bob issues a query through the
   SQLLine client, SQLLine passes the query to the connecting Drillbit.
   The Drillbit executes the query as the system user that started the
   Drill process on the node. For the purpose of this example, we will
   assume that the system user has full access to the file system. Drill
   executes the query and returns the results back to the client.

   When impersonation is enabled and user Bob issues a query through the
   SQLLine client, the Drillbit uses Bob's credentials to access data in
   the file system. The file system checks to see if Bob has permission to
   access the data. If Bob has permission, Drill returns the query results
   to the client. If Bob does not have permission, Drill returns an error.

Impersonation Support

   Drill supports impersonation with the following clients, storage
   plugins, and types of queries:
     * Clients
          + ODBC
          + JDBC
          + REST API
          + Drill Web UI
     * Storage plugins
          + MapR Filesystem
          + MapR Database
          + Hive
     * Types of queries
       Note: When you enable impersonation, the setting applies to queries
       on data and metadata. For example, if you issue the SHOW SCHEMAS
       command, Drill impersonates the user logged into the client to
       access the requested metadata. If you issue a SELECT query on a
       workspace, Drill impersonates the user logged in to the client to
       access the requested data.
       Drill applies impersonation to queries issued using the following
       commands:
          + SHOW SCHEMAS
          + SHOW DATABASES
          + SHOW TABLES
          + CTAS
          + SELECT
          + CREATE VIEW
          + DROP VIEW
          + SHOW FILES.
            Note: To successfully run the CTAS and CREATE VIEW commands, a
            user must have write permissions on the directory where the
            table or view will exist. Running these commands creates
            artifacts on the file system.
