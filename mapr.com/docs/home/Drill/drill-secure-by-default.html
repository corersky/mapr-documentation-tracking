Drill Default Security

   The default security configuration uses MapR-SASL (tickets) for
   authentication, authorization, and encryption to automatically secure
   the MapR cluster and ecosystem components when you install them
   manually or using the MapR Installer.
   The default security configuration automatically secures all Drill
   communication paths with the following exceptions:
     * The path between the web client and web server (W) uses [1]SSL/TLS
       with form-based authentication.
     * The path between the ODBC/JDBC client and ZooKeeper (Zn, Zo) is
       unsecure.

   The following diagram shows the secured communication paths:
   [drill-security-architecture.PNG]
   The following table describes the security support for each
   communication path in the diagram, as well as the components involved
   in the communication:
   Type of Security Supported Communication Path

   Component Communication
   Authentication and encryption using MapR-SASL (tickets) C ODBC
   client/C++ API to Drillbits
     J JDBC client/Java API to Drillbits
     D1, D2, Dn Drillbit to Drillbit
     M Drillbit to MapR Database/MapR Filesystem
     H
   Drillbit to Hive
   Note: The Hive storage plugin is not secured by default and requires
   that you manually modify the configuration to enable security. See
   [2]Configuring the Hive Storage Plugin.

   Plain authentication with SSL encryption (HTTPS enabled)
   W
   Web client/Web API to Web server
   Note: The HTTPS channel (Web client) uses Plain authentication to
   authenticate a Web client with SSL/TLS for encryption. This is
   configured by default in a secure 6.x cluster with Drill 1.11 or later
   installed. Plain authentication does not support encryption. You must
   enable SSL to encrypt the communication channels when using Plain
   authentication. See [3]Configuring Drill Web UI and Web API Security.
   Authentication with MapR security (no encryption) Zj
   Drillbit to ZooKeeper
   Note: The Drillbit creates znodes, for which ZooKeeper ACLs provide
   security. See [4]Security Between ZooKeeper and Drillbits for more
   information.
   No security support Zo, Zn ODBC/JDBC client to ZooKeeper
   Note: Only znodes created for Drillbit endpoints in Zookeeper are
   readable by the client. All other znodes (not required by the client)
   are secured using ZooKeeper ACLs and are only readable by Drillbits.
   Note: [5]Kerberos and [6]Plain authentication are not enabled or
   configured as part of the default security configuration. However, you
   can manually configure these security mechanisms in addition to the
   defaults. Any time Plain authentication is enabled, you must use
   [7]SSL/TLS for encryption.
   Note: Drill clients running Drill 1.10 and earlier do not support
   encryption and cannot connect to Drillbits installed with the default
   MapR security configuration.

Disabling Security

   You can turn off the default MapR security configuration across the
   entire MapR cluster.
   Note: If you unsecure a cluster, you must backup the Drill znodes.
   After the switch to unsecured, update the ACL on the Drill znodes so
   that Drill in an unsecured cluster can access all Drill znodes. See
   [8]Security Between ZooKeeper and Drillbits for more information.
   To disable the default security configuration across an entire MapR
   cluster, run configure.sh with the -unsecure parameter, as shown:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -forceSecurityDefaults [ -unsecure | -secure ]
 -C <CLDB_node> -Z <ZK_node>

   Alternatively, you can enable security across an entire MapR cluster
   with the -secure parameter.

   See [9]Drill Installation and [10]configure.sh for more information.

Additional Notes

   Performance
          The default security configuration enables encryption for all
          network channels, which can affect Drill performance. If
          performance is your highest priority, install MapR and Drill
          without security enabled and have your security expert manually
          configure cluster security. Alternatively, you can install MapR
          and Drill with security enabled, and then disable individual
          Drill security settings. For example you can edit the
          drill-override.conf file and disable encryption, leaving
          authentication enabled.

          Note: MapR does not recommend manually configuring security
          settings when default security is enabled.

   Drill Configuration Files
          The default security configuration introduces new Drill
          configuration files. In addition to drill-override.conf,
          distrib-env.sh, and drill-env.sh, Drill includes a
          drill-distrib.conf file. See [11]Drill Configuration Files for
          more information. Note that modifying drill
          distribution-specific files is highly discouraged. To customize
          any Drill configuration, use drill-override.conf and
          drill-env.sh.

   HBase
          As of MapR 6.0 and Drill 1.11, HBase is no longer supported,
          therefore the communication path between Drill and HBase is also
          not supported.
