Connecting to a ZooKeeper Cluster

   You can connect Drill to a ZooKeeper cluster using a connection URL.

   The following connection URL shows you the format for connecting Drill
   to a ZooKeeper cluster. The serverlist is a comma-separated list of
   servers in the ZooKeeper cluster, and clustername is the unique name of
   the Drillbit cluster that you want to use.
jdbc:drill:zk=<serverlist>/drill/<clustername>

   Note: You can locate the name of the Drillbit cluster in
   /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-distrib.conf. The default
   name of the Drillbit cluster is drillbits1. The name is set by the
   cluster-id property. If you have multiple Drill clusters, you may want
   to override the Drillbit cluster name in drill-override.conf; however;
   first [1]back-up your storage plugin configurations, as they will reset
   to the defaults when you change the cluster name. Restart Drill after
   you edit drill-override.conf.

   Optionally, you can specify any of the connection properties supported
   by the driver. For a list of the properties available in the driver,
   see [2]Drill JDBC Driver.

   Optional Settings

   The following connection URL specifies some optional settings:
jdbc:drill:zk=<serverlist>/drill/<clustername><clustername>;
<property1>=<value><value>;
<property2>=<value><value>;...

   Example

   To connect to a ZooKeeper cluster and authenticate the connection with
   Plain authentication (a username and password), you would use the
   following connection URL:
jdbc:drill:zk=192.168.39.43:5181, 192.168.1.1:31010/drill/drillbits1;
auth=PLAIN;
UID=<username>;
PWD=<password>
