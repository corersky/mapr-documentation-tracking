SET maprdb Format Plugin Options

   You can use the SET command to enable or disable the Drill native
   reader.

   Starting in Drill 1.14 (MEP 6.0), you can enable the
   store.hive.maprdb_json.optimize_scan_with_native_reader option if you
   want Drill to use the native Drill reader to read [1]Hive MapR-DB JSON
   tables. When you enable the native Drill reader, Drill typically
   performs faster reads of data and applies filter pushdown
   optimizations.
   Use the [2]SET command to enable the
   store.hive.maprdb_json.optimize_scan_with_native_reader option, as
   shown:
SET `store.hive.maprdb_json.optimize_scan_with_native_reader` = true;
