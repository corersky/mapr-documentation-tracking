SSL Certificates in Secure and Unsecure MapR Clusters

   The Drill server requires an SSL certificate. The certificate can be
   self-signed or signed by a CA (Certificate Authority).

   The sections below describe how to use SSL certificates in secure and
   unsecure MapR clusters.

SSL in a Secure MapR Cluster

   By default, SSL is configured in a secure MapR cluster, but not
   enabled. In a secure cluster the keystore is configured for you. The
   security in a MapR cluster uses a self-signed certificate. If you have
   a certificate signed by a certificate authority, follow the
   instructions in [1]Importing a Custom SSL Certificate and then enable
   and configure SSL.
   To use SSL, enable the SSL option and then modify any of the available
   configuration options, if needed.
   Note: To enable SSL for the ODBC/JDBC client to Drillbit communication
   path, you must enable SSL on the client side and Drillbit. See [2]Drill
   Drivers for client instructions. See [3]Configuring SSL/TLS for the
   Drillbit.
   Note: To enable SSL for the Drill Web UI, see [4]Configuring the Drill
   Web UI and Web API Security.
   After you modify the configuration options, restart Drill, as shown:
$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <node host names
 separated by a space>

SSL in an Unsecure MapR Cluster

   Before you can enable SSL in an unsecure MapR cluster, you must either
   get or generate a certificate and then import the certificate into the
   Java keystore. You can do this using the Java keytool utility. See
   [5]To Use keytool to Create a Server Certificate for instructions.

   If you have a custom certificate, you can import it using the method
   described in[6]Importing a Custom SSL Certificate.

   After you generate or import a server certificate, add the path (and
   password) to the keystore in the SSL configuration for Drill. See the
   SSL configuration options section below for information on how to
   update the SSL configuration.

   Restart Drill after you modify the configuration options, as shown:
$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <node host names
 separated by a space>
