Security Between ZooKeeper and Drillbits

   When Drill is installed on MapR clusters with the default security
   enabled, authentication is enabled between the Drillbits and ZooKeeper.
   The ZooKeeper znode information is secured automatically through
   authentication and znode ACLs. Communication between the Drillbits and
   Zookeeper is not encrypted.
   Note: If you installed Drill on a MapR cluster that does not have the
   default security configuration, and you are configuring custom
   security, you must enable authentication and manually set ACLs on the
   znodes.

   Drill uses ZooKeeper to store certain cluster-level configuration and
   query profile information in znodes. A znode is an internal data tree
   in ZooKeeper that stores coordination and execution related
   information. If information in the znodes is not properly secured,
   cluster privacy and/or security is compromised.

   ZooKeeper uses ACLs to control access to znodes and secure the
   information they store. Starting in Drill 1.15, you can create a custom
   ACL (Access Control List) on the znodes to secure data. ACLs specify
   sets of ids and permissions that are associated with the ids.
   Prior to Drill 1.15, ZooKeeper ACLs in secure and unsecure clusters
   were set to [world:all], meaning that all users had create, delete,
   read, write, and administrator access to the zknodes. Starting in Drill
   1.15, ACLs in unsecure clusters are set to [world:all]. ACLs in secure
   clusters are set to [authid: all], which provides full access to the
   authenticated user that created the znode only. Discovery znodes
   (znodes with the list of Drillbits) have an additional ACL set to
   [world:read] making the list of Drillbits readable by any user.
   Note: View the [1]drill-override-example.conf file to see example ACL
   configurations.

Securing znodes

   Complete the following steps to create a custom ACL and secure znodes:
    1. Write a class that implements the ZKACLProvider interface. This
       class will contain the ACLs that need to be set on the znodes. You
       can use the [2]ZKSecureACLProvider class as a sample reference.
    2. Add the following dependency to the pom file of the project module
       created:
<groupId>org.apache.drill.exec</groupId>
<artifactId>drill-java-exec</artifactId>
    3. Refer to the steps listed at
       [3]https://drill.apache.org/docs/manually-adding-custom-functions-t
       o-drill/ to create a JAR and then add the JAR to Drill's classpath.
    4. In /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf, set
       zk.acl_provider to the ZKACLProviderTemplate type.
    5. Restart Drill. When you restart Drill, the ACL, as mentioned in
       your custom class, is applied to the znode created when Drill
       starts.

   Note: Existing ACLs for persistent znodes will not be affected if a
   Drillbit is restarted with a different ACL setting. ACLs are applied
   only at znode creation time. Drill does not recreate any znode that is
   already present. If you want to change an ACL for existing znodes,
   connect to the ZooKeeper server using zkCli and then use option a or b,
   as described:
     * a) Shutdown Drillbits, delete the persistent znodes, change the ACL
       settings, and restart the Drillbit.
     * b) Manually change the ACLs on the existing znodes to reflect the
       new ACL settings, using the setAcl command in the zkCli.

   For either option to work, an authenticated connection between the
   zkCli and ZooKeeper Server must be established.
