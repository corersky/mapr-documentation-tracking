Security Between ZooKeeper and Drillbits

   When Drill 1.11 and later is installed on MapR 6.x clusters with the
   default security enabled, authentication is enabled between the
   Drillbits and ZooKeeper.
   The ZooKeeper znode information is secured automatically through
   authentication and [1]znode ACLs. The communication between Zookeeper
   and the Drillbits is not encrypted.
   Note: If you installed Drill on a MapR cluster that does not have the
   default security configuration, and you are configuring custom
   security, you must enable authentication and [2]set ACLs on the znodes
   manually. However, setting ACLs manually for Drill znodes is not
   recommended. If you set ACLs manually, you must set them the same as a
   Drillbit would have set them in a secure MapR cluster, as described
   previously.

   Drill uses ZooKeeper to discover and coordinate Drillbits. Drillbits
   use Zookeeper znodes to store coordination-related information, as well
   as execution-related information. If the information stored in the
   znodes is not properly secured, it can compromise the security and/or
   privacy of the cluster.

   The znode ACLs are set such that only the Drillbit user (the user that
   started the Drillbits in the cluster) can access (create, delete, read,
   write, administer) all of the Drillbit ZooKeeper nodes, with the
   exception of the Drill ZooKeeper nodes that hold information about the
   Drillbits in the cluster. Drill clients use these Drill ZooKeeper nodes
   to discover and connect to the Drillbits in a cluster.
