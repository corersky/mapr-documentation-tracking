Drill Storage and Format Plugin Support Matrix

   MapR supports Apache Drill running on the MapR distribution of Hadoop
   as the underlying storage platform in single or a multi-node
   deployments. See [1]Component Versions for Released MEPs for versioning
   information.

   MapR supports Apache Drill deployed without Hadoop in a standalone
   configuration on a single node, however MapR does not support
   multi-node standalone cluster deployments of Apache Drill. Note that
   Apache Drill itself does not require Hadoop.

   MapR does not support Drill running on other distributions of Hadoop as
   the underlying storage platform, such as Cloudera and Hortonworks.

   The following table lists the supported and unsupported data sources
   and formats in Drill on MapR:
   Data Source Storage Plugin Type Formats Supported by MapR
   MapR Filesystem dfs Text (CSV, TSV, PSV) Yes
       Parquet Yes
       JSON Yes
       Avro No
   MapR Database dfs Binary Yes
       JSON Yes
   HBase hbase Binary No (as of Drill 1.11 and MapR 6.0)
   Hive hive Text (CSV, TSV, PSV) Yes
       Parquet Yes
       JSON Yes
       Avro Yes
       Other Hive built-in SerDes Yes (Not recommended due to the memory
   overhead and performance implications.)
   S3 s3 Supports the same formats as the dfs storage plugin. Yes
   MongoDB mongodb N/A No
   RDBMS jdbc N/A No
   Kudu kudu N/A No
   Kafka kafka JSON No
   Note: The kafka storage plugin on MapR Streams is in the Alpha testing
   phase and not officially supported. See [2]Configuring the Kafka
   Storage Plugin for more information.
   OpenTSDB openTSDB N/A
   Note: The openTSDB storage plugin is not officially supported. See
   [3]OpenTSDB Storage Plugin for more information.
   Note: As of MapR 6.0 and Drill 1.11, HBase is no longer supported,
   therefore the communication path between Drill and HBase is also not
   supported. If you have an hbase storage plugin configured in Drill, you
   should disable it.
