Step 4: Launch Drill Under YARN

   Now that the Drill and YARN configuration is complete, you can issue
   the start command from the Drill-on-YARN client to launch Drill under
   YARN. Launching Drill-on-YARN from the client starts Drill and brings
   Drill up on other nodes.
   Issuing the start command starts the YARN Application Master, which
   then works with YARN to start the drillbits. The Application Master
   provides a web UI to monitor the cluster.
   Note: To simplify debugging, you can set the cluster size to a single
   node. Once you confirm that a single node works, increase the node
   count.
   Launch Drill under YARN as the "mapr" user. For example, if you
   installed Drill as “mapr,” launch Drill as the mapr user.
   Note: If you launch Drill as “root” and the system returns an error
   failing the launch attempt, launch Drill as a whitelisted user, such as
   “mapr.”
   Issue the following command to start Drill under YARN:
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh --site $DRILL_SITE start

   Note: To avoid typing the site argument each time you launch Drill
   under YARN, set an environment variable:
export DRILL_CONF_DIR=$DRILL_SITE
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh start

   After you issue the start command, a number of lines describing the
   startup process prints. The tool automatically archives and uploads the
   site directory, which YARN copies (along with the Drill software) onto
   each node. A URL that includes both the host and the port number
   displays. Enter the URL in a web browser to access the Application
   Master web UI.
   Note: When you launch Drill from the Drill-on-YARN client, the
   Application Master can come up on any node. Save the provided URL to
   share with other users so they can also access the Application Master.
   Alternatively, you can run the status command to see the URL or go to
   the YARN Resource Manager UI to get the link.

   See [1]Drill-on-YARN Command Line Tool for additional commands,
   including stop, status, and resize. See [2]Application Master Web UI
   for cluster monitoring information.
