Roles and Privileges

   Drill has USER and ADMIN roles. Each role can perform different
   functions in Drill.

   Access in the Drill Web UI differs between users and administrators.
   Certain pages are shown based on privilege. For example, only
   administrators can see the Storage tab and edit a storage plugin
   configuration.

   The following sections describe a few additional differences between a
   user and an administrator in Drill.

USER Role

   The following list notes the functions that a user can perform in
   Drill:
     * Users can run queries on data to which they have access.
     * Users can view and cancel their own queries in the Profiles tab of
       the Drill Web UI.
     * Users can create views on data to provide granular access to that
       data.
       Note: Each data source manages the read/write permissions.

ADMIN Role

   When authentication is enabled, only Drill users assigned the
   administrator (ADMIN) role can perform the following tasks:
     * Change system-level options by issuing the ALTER SYSTEM command or
       through the options tab in the Drill Web UI.
     * Update a storage plugin configuration through the REST API or Drill
       Web UI.
     * View the profiles of all queries run by all users.
     * Cancel running queries that were launched by any user in the
       cluster.
     * Shut down the Drillbit in the Drill Web UI.
