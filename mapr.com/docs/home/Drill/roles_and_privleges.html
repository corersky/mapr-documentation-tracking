Roles and Privileges

   Drill has USER and ADMIN roles. Each role can perform different
   functions in Drill.

   Access in the Drill Web UI differs between users and administrators.
   Certain pages are exposed based on privilege. For example, only
   administrators can see the Storage tab and edit a storage plugin
   configuration.

   The following sections describe a few additional differences between a
   user and an administrator in Drill.

USER Role

   The following list notes the functions that a user can perform in
   Drill:
     * Users can run queries on data to which they have access.
     * Users can view and cancel their own queries in the Profiles tab of
       the Drill Web UI.
     * Users can create views on data to provide granular access to that
       data.
       Note: Each data source manages the read/write permissions.

ADMIN Role

   When authentication is enabled, only Drill users assigned the
   administrator (ADMIN) role can perform the following tasks:
     * Change system-level options by issuing the ALTER SYSTEM command or
       through the options tab in the Drill Web UI.
     * Update a storage plugin configuration through the REST API or Drill
       Web UI.
     * View the profiles of all queries run by all users.
     * Cancel running queries that were launched by any user in the
       cluster.
     * Shut down the Drillbit in the Drill Web UI.

Configuring USER and ADMIN Roles

   You can define administrative users through the
   security.admin.user_groups and security.admin.users options.

   The default value for admin.users is the drill_process_user. The
   default value for admin.user_groups is drill_process_user_groups. These
   options accept a comma-separated list of users or user groups.
   To edit these options, use the SET command, as shown in the following
   examples:
ALTER SYSTEM SET `security.admin.user_groups` = 'drill, %drill_process_user_grou
ps%';
ALTER SYSTEM SET `security.admin.users` = 'user1, %drill_process_user%';
ALTER SYSTEM SET `security.admin.users` = 'user1, user2';
