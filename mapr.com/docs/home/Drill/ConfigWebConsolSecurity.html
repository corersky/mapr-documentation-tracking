Configuring Drill Web UI and Web API Security

   The Drill web client and web API communicate with web browsers or web
   tools, like curl, through the HTTP or HTTPS. Drill uses HTTP by
   default.

   Drill supports [1]form-based (similar to Plain authentication) and
   [2]SPNEGO authentication mechanisms to authenticate the communication
   between the web client and web browser or web tools. Drill supports
   SSL/TLS for encryption with form-based and SPNEGO authentication.
   An administrator can configure security mechanisms and [3]set up Drill
   Web UI administrators and administrator-user groups to control access
   to the Drill Web UI and Web API client applications. For example,
   limiting user access to Drill Web UI functionality, such as viewing or
   canceling queries submitted by other users.
   Note:
     * The Drill web server does not support MAPR-SASL (tickets).
     * With Drill Web UI security in place, users without administrator
       privileges must execute the SHOW SCHEMAS command in the Drill Web
       UI Query page to see storage plugin configuration information.

Form-Based Authentication

   In MEP 5.0 and later, Drill supports form-based authentication between
   the web client and Drillbit. Form-based authentication is like [4]Plain
   Authentication in that a user is presented with a web form where s/he
   enters a username and password to access restricted web pages.
   Form-based authentication also uses the Linux PAM (Pluggable
   Authentication Module).

   [5]Configuring Drill to Use libpam4j provides configuration details.
   When using form-based authentication, you can also configure Drill to
   use [6]SPNEGO for HTTP Authentication and SSL/TLS for encryption.

HTTPS Support

   The Drill Web UI supports the HTTPS protocol for encryption. With the
   default MapR security configuration, HTTPS is enabled for Drill and it
   uses SSL trust- and keystore, which comes with MapR cluster
   installation.

   To use custom certificates, see [7]SSL Certificates in Secure and
   Unsecure MapR Clusters.
   The following example shows the default HTTPS configuration in
   <DRILL_INSTALL_HOME>/conf/drill-distrib.conf for a secure MapR cluster
   installation:
drill.exec: {
              http.ssl_enabled: true,
              ssl.useHadoopConfig: true
}

   You can configure additional parameters:
   Drill Property Name Hadoop Property Name System Property Name
   Description Allowed Values Drill Default
   drill.exec.http.ssl_enabled:     Enable or disable TLS for Web client -
   Drill Web Server communication. You must set this option in
   drill-override.conf. true/false false
   Note: This option is set to "true" by default for a secure
   installation.
   drill.exec.ssl.keyStorePath ssl.server.keystore.location
   javax.net.ssl.keyStore Location of the Java keystore file containing
   the Drillbitâ€™s own certificate and private key. On Windows, the
   specified pathname must use forward slashes, /, in place of
   backslashes.   The Drill web server generates a self-signed certificate
   and stores the certificate in an in-memory keystore.
   drill.exec.ssl.keyStorePassword ssl.server.keystore.password
   javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword Password to access the private key from
   the keystore file. This password is used twice: To unlock the keystore
   file (store password), and to decrypt the private key stored in the
   keystore (key password) unless a key password is specified separately.

   drill.exec.ssl.keyPassword ssl.server.keystore.keypassword   Password
   to access the private key from the keystore file. May be different from
   the keystore password.
   drill.exec.ssl.trustStorePath ssl.server.truststore.location
   javax.net.ssl.trustStore Location of the Java keystore file containing
   the collection of CA certificates trusted by the Drill client. On
   Windows, the specified pathname must use forward slashes, /, in place
   of backslashes.
   drill.exec.ssl.trustStorePassword ssl.server.truststore.password
   javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword Password to access the private key
   from the keystore file specified as the truststore.
   drill.exec.ssl.useHadoopConfig
   Use the setting in the hadoop configuration file. The hadoop
   configuration is specified in the file pointed to by the
   hadoop.ssl.server.conf parameter in the core-site.xml file. Typically,
   this parameter points to $HADOOP_CONF/ssl-server.xml which contains the
   property names to configure TLS.
   Note: Verify that $HADOOP_CONF/ssl-server.xml file is located in
   Drill's classpath. If not, you can create a symbolic link to this file
   in the Drill configuration directory, for example:
<DRILL_INSTALL_HOME>/conf/ssl-server.xml

   .
   true/false

   default:true
