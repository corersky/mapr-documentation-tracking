Drill

   Drill is a low-latency distributed query engine for large-scale
   datasets, including structured and semi-structured/nested data.
   Inspired by Googleâ€™s Dremel, Drill is designed to scale to several
   thousands of nodes and query petabytes of data at interactive speeds
   that BI/Analytics environments require.

   Drill includes a distributed execution environment, purpose built for
   large-scale data processing. At the core of Drill is the "Drillbit"
   service which is responsible for accepting requests from the client,
   processing the queries, and returning results to the client.

Installing Drill

   You can install Drill on any number of nodes in a cluster. For example,
   you can install Drill on one node in a cluster or on multiple nodes in
   a cluster. When a Drillbit runs on each data node in a cluster, Drill
   can maximize data locality during query execution without moving data
   over the network or between nodes. Drill uses ZooKeeper to maintain
   cluster membership and health check information.

   See [1]Installing Drill for guidance.
