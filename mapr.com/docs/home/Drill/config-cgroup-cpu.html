Configuring cgroups to Control CPU Usage

   You can configure a Linux cgroup to enforce CPU limits on the Drillbit
   service running on a node. Linux cgroups (control groups) enable you to
   limit system resources to defined user groups or processes.

   You can use the cgconfig service to configure a Drill cgroup to control
   CPU usage and then set the CPU limits for the Drill cgroup on each
   Drill node in the /etc/cgconfig.conf file.
   Prior to Drill 1.14, you had to update the cgroup.procs file with the
   Drill process ID (PID) each time a Drillbit restarted in order to
   enforce the CPU limit for the Drillbit service. As of Drill 1.14, Drill
   can directly manage the CPU resources through the Drill start-up
   script, drill-env.sh. You no longer have to manually add the PID to the
   cgroup.procs file each time a Drillbit restarts. This step occurs
   automatically upon restart. The start-up script checks for the
   specified cgroup, such as drillcpu, and then applies the cgroup to the
   launched Drillbit JVM. The Drillbit CPU resource usage is then managed
   under the cgroup, drillcpu.
   Note: The Linux kernel version must support cgroups v2 to use this
   feature. Version 4.5 officially supports cgroups v2. You can run the
   following command to get the kernel version:
uname -r

   The drill-env.sh script contains variables that you must enable for
   Drill to directly manage the CPU resources. Uncomment (by removing #)
   the following variables in drill-env.sh to enable the feature:
   Variable Description
   export DRILLBIT_CGROUP=${DRILLBIT_CGROUP:-"drillcpu"} Sets the cgroup
   to which the Drillbit belongs when running as a daemon using
   drillbit.sh start. Drill uses the cgroup for CPU enforcement only.
   export SYS_CGROUP_DIR=${SYS_CGROUP_DIR:-"/sys/fs/cgroup"} Drill assumes
   the default cgroup mount location set by systemd (the system and
   service manager for Linux operating systems). If your cgroup mount
   location is in a different location, change the setting to match your
   location.
   export DRILL_PID_DIR=${DRILL_PID_DIR:-$DRILL_HOME} The location of the
   Drillbit PID file when Drill is running as a daemon using drillbit.sh
   start. By default, this location is set to $DRILL_HOME.

CPU Limits

   You can set the CPU limit as a soft or hard limit, or both. You set the
   limits with parameters in the /etc/cgconfig.conf file. The hard limit
   takes precedence over the soft limit. When Drill hits the hard limit,
   in-progress queries may not complete. The following sections describe
   the parameters for soft and hard limits.
     * Soft Limit Parameter
       You set the soft limit with the cpu.shares parameter. When you set
       a soft limit, Drill can exceed the CPU allocated if extra CPU is
       available for use on the system. Drill can continue to use CPU
       until there is contention with other processes over the CPU or
       Drill hits the hard limit.
     * Hard Limit Parameters
       You set the hard limit with the cpu.cfs_period_us and
       cpu.cfs_quota_us parameters. These parameters set a hard limit on
       the amount of CPU time that the Drill process can use.
          + cpu.cfs_period_us
            The cpu.cfs_period_us parameter specifies a segment of time
            (in microseconds represented by us for µs) for how often the
            access to CPU resources should be reallocated.
          + cpu.cfs_quota_us
            The cpu.cfs_quota_us parameter specifies the total amount of
            runtime (in microseconds represented by usfor µs) for which
            all tasks in the Drill cgroup can run during one period (as
            defined by cpu.cfs_period_us). As soon as tasks in the Drill
            cgroup use the time specified by the quota, they are throttled
            for the remainder of the time specified by the period and not
            allowed to run until the next period.

Before You Begin

   Each Drill node must have the libcgroup package installed to configure
   CPU limits for a Drill cgroup. The libcgroup package installs the
   cgconfig service required to configure and manage the Drill cgroup.
   You can install the libcgroup package using the yum install command, as
   shown:
yum install libcgroup

   Note: For Drill to directly manage the CPU resources through the Drill
   start-up script, drill-env.sh, the Linux kernel version must support
   cgroups v2. Version 4.5 of the kernel officially supports cgroups v2.
   You can run the following command to get the kernel version:
 uname -r

Configuring CPU Limits

   Complete the following steps to set a hard and/or soft limit on Drill
   CPU usage for the Drill process running on the node:
    1. Start the cgconfig service:
service cgconfig start
    2. Add a cgroup for Drill in the /etc/cgconfig.conf file:
group drillcpu {
                 cpu {
                        cpu.shares = 320;
                        cpu.cfs_quota_us = 400000;
                        cpu.cfs_period_us = 100000;
                        }
                 }
       Note: The cgroup name is specific to the Drill cgroup and does not
       correlate with any other configuration.
       In the configuration example, the cpu.shares parameter sets the
       soft limit. The other two parameters, cpu.cfs_quota_us and
       cpu.cfs_period_us, set the hard limit. If you prefer to set only
       one type of limit, remove the parameters that do not apply.
       To set a soft limit, allocate a specific number of CPU shares to
       the Drill cgroup in the configuration. Calculate the CPU shares as:
1024 (CPU allocated to Drill/Total available CPU)
       In the example, CPU shares was calculated as:
1024 (10/32) = 320
       To set a hard limit, add limits to the cpu.cfs_quota_us and
       cpu.cfs_period_us parameters. In the configuration example, the
       Drill process can fully utilize 4 CPU.
       Note: The hard limit parameter settings persist after each cgroup
       service restart. Alternatively, you can set the parameters at the
       session level using the following commands:
echo 400000 > /cgroup/cpu/drillcpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us
   echo 100000 > /cgroup/cpu/drillcpu/cpu.cfs_period_us
    3. (Optional) If you want the cgconfig service to automatically
       restart upon system reboots, run the following command:
chkconfig cgconfig on
       Note: Only complete step 4 if you have not enabled Drill to
       directly manage the CPU resources through the start-up script,
       drill-env.sh.
    4. Run the following command to add the Drill process ID (PID) to the
       /cgroup/cpu/drillcpu/cgroup.procs file, as shown:
echo 25809 > /cgroup/cpu/drillcpu/cgroup.procs
       Note: You must perform this step each time a Drillbit restarts.
