Configuring the ZooKeeper PStore Location

   By default, the ZooKeeper PStore offloads query profile data to
   maprfs:///apps/drill/profiles. You can override the default location in
   the drill-override.conf file.

   When query profile data is stored on a distributed system, like MapR
   File System, you can see a [1]global query list (view of query profiles
   coordinated by all Drill nodes in one Web UI).
   To change the [2]ZooKeeper PStore location, update the drill.exec block
   in /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf with the
   following configuration, as shown:
drill.exec: {
        cluster-id: "my_cluster_com-drillbits",
        zk.connect: "<zkhostname>:5181",
        sys.store.provider.zk.blobroot: "maprfs:///new/storage/location/"
   }

   Note: By default, the MapR File System replicates the data three times.
   If you are concerned about storage consumption, you can create a new
   volume specifically for query profile data, and set the replication
   value to 1 for that volume. After you create the volume, update
   sys.store.provider.zk.blobroot to point to the volume. See [3]Creating
   a Volume for additional information.
   After you modify drill-override.conf, restart Drill:
maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <drill-hostnames-s
eparated-by-a-space>
