Drill-on-YARN Command Line Tool

   Run the Drill-on-YARN command line tool from the Drill-on-YARN client
   and use it to start, stop, resize, and check the status of the Drill
   cluster. When you launch Drill from the command line, the tool
   automatically archives and uploads the “site” directory, which YARN
   deploys (along with Drill) onto each node.
   You can access the Drill-on-YARN command line tool in the following
   directory:
 $DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh --site $DRILL_SITE command

   where command is the operation you want to perform, such as start.
   To avoid having to type the site argument for each command, set an
   environment variable:
export DRILL_CONF_DIR=$DRILL_SITE

   The following example shows the start command after setting the
   environment variable:
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh start

Command Summary

   The following table lists the commands and provides a brief summary for
   each:

   CAPTION:

   Command Description
   start Starts the Drill cluster. Prints the startup status followed by a
   summary of the application.
   status Retrieves basic information about the Drill cluster.
   stop Stops the Drill cluster.

   resize <value>

   resize + <increase_node_count_by>

   resize - <decrease_ node_count_by>
   Adds or removes nodes in the Drill cluster while the cluster runs. You
   can specify the exact number of nodes you want to run, or you can use
   +/- to increase or decrease the current node count by a certain amount.
   clean Removes the cached Drill archive from the designated DFS
   directory.

Commands

   The following sections provide detailed information and examples for
   each of the commands listed in the command summary:

   start
          The start command launches Drill and provides a startup status
          followed by a summary of the application.

          The first line in the summary displays the cluster name from the
          configuration file to confirm which cluster is starting.

Launching Drill-on-YARN...

          The next line shows the YARN application ID and tracks the job
          status from Accepted to Running.

Application ID: application_1462842354064_0001
Application State: ACCEPTED
Starting......
Application State: RUNNING

          Once the job starts, you see the YARN job tracking URL with the
          Drill-on-YARN web UI URL.

Application Master URL: http://<YARN_Job_Tracking_URL>:8048/

          Once the application starts, the Drill-on-YARN writes an “appid”
          file into the Drill installation directory:

ls /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>
…
drillbits1.appid

          The file name is the same as the Drill cluster ID. The file
          contains the ID of the Drill-on-YARN application. The other
          commands use this ID. You can run only one Drill application at
          a time. If you attempt to start a second from the same client
          machine on which you started the first, the client command
          complains that the appid file already exists. If you attempt to
          start the cluster from a different node, the second application
          detects a conflict and shuts down again.

          Example

$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh start

Launching Drill-on-YARN...
Application ID: application_1462842354064_0001
Application State: ACCEPTED
Starting......
Application State: RUNNING
Tracking URL: http://10.250.50.31:8088/proxy/application_1462842354064_0001/
Application Master URL: http://10.250.50.31:8048/

   status
          The status command retrieves basic information about the Drill
          cluster and provides a status summary.

          The first several lines of the status summary provide
          information about the state of YARN, which includes the
          application ID, the application state, and YARN’s tracking URL
          for the application.

Application ID: application_1462842354064_0001
Application State: RUNNING
Host: yosemite/10.250.50.31
Tracking URL:

          Following the state of YARN information is the host on which the
          Drill application is running, the queue on which the application
          was placed, and the user who submitted the application. The
          start time tells you when YARN started the application.

http://10.250.50.31:8088/proxy/application_1462842354064_0001/
Queue: default
User: drilluser
Start Time: 2016-05-09 16:56:40

          The next few lines are specific to Drill, including the name of
          the application (which you configured in the drill-on-yarn.conf
          configuration file), the Drill Application Master URL, the
          number of drillbits you requested to run, and the number
          actually running.

Application Name: Drill-on-YARN
AM State: LIVE
Target Drillbit Count: 1
Live Drillbit Count: 1

          Finally, the last line provides the URL for the Drill-on-YARN
          web UI.

          Example

$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh status

   stop
          The stop command stops the Drill cluster. This command is
          forceful and kills any in-flight queries. The output tracks the
          shutdown and displays the final YARN application status.

          Example

$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh stop

Stopping Application ID: application_1462842354064_0001
Stopping...
Stopped.
Final status: SUCCEEDED

   resize
          The resize command changes the number of nodes in the cluster.
          You can use this command to add or remove nodes in the Drill
          cluster as it runs. You can specify the change either by giving
          the number of nodes you want to run, or by using the + or - to
          specify the change in node count.

          Drill adds nodes only if additional nodes are available from
          YARN. If you request to stop more nodes than are running, Drill
          stops all of the running nodes.

          Example

$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh resize 10
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh resize +2
$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh resize -3

   clean
          The clean command removes the cached Drill archive from the
          designated DFS directory. If you run Drill-on-YARN for a
          temporary cluster, Drill leaves the Drill software archive in
          your designated DFS directory. Specifically, the first start
          uploads the Drill archive to DFS. Stop leaves the archive in
          DFS. Subsequent start commands reuse the cached archive if it is
          the same size as the version on the local disk. Clean removes
          the cached file, forcing Drill to upload a fresh copy if you
          again restart the Drill cluster.

          Example

$DRILL_HOME/bin/drill-on-yarn.sh clean
