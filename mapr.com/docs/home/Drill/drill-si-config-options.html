Index Planning and Execution Configuration Options

   The 1.11 release of Drill for MapR introduces options that affect how
   Drill uses indexes when planning and executing queries. You can set the
   query planning and execution options, at the system or session level,
   using the ALTER SYSTEM|SESSION SET commands, as shown:
ALTER SYSTEM SET `planner.enable_index_planning` = true
ALTER SESSION SET `planner.enable_index_planning` = false

   Options set at the session level only apply to queries that you run
   during the current Drill connection. Options set at the system level
   affect the entire system and persist between restarts. Session level
   settings override system level settings. Typically, you set the options
   at the session level unless you want the setting to persist across all
   sessions.
   The following table lists the index planning and execution options that
   you can enable, disable, or modify:
   Note: The planning option names are prefaced by planner, for example
   planner.enable_index_planning. The execution options are prefaced by
   exec, for example exec.query.rowkeyjoin_batchsize.
   Option Description Default Value Possible Values
   planner.enable_index_planning Enables or disables index planning true
   true|false
   planner.index.force_sort_noncovering Forces Drill to sort for
   non-covering indexes. If the query has an ORDER-BY on index columns and
   a non-covering index is chosen, by default Drill leverages the
   sortedness of the index columns and does not sort. Fast changing
   primary table data may produce a partial sort. This option forces a
   sort within Drill.
   Note: (Drill 1.11 only) You must enable this option for Drill to return
   the results of a non-covering query in sorted order.
   false true|false
   planner.enable_rowkeyjoin_conversion Introduced in Drill 1.13. Drill
   can push down the rowkey filter to MapR Database during runtime. For a
   query to qualify for runtime filter pushdown, the join condition must
   filter on a rowkey. A rowkey is the value of the _id field in a JSON
   document, for example:
SELECT t.mscIdentities FROM dfs.root.`/user/mapr/MixTable` t WHERE t.row_key IN
(SELECT max(convert_fromutf8(i.KeyA.ENTRY_KEY)) FROM dfs.root.`/user/mapr/TableI
MSI` i WHERE i.row_key='460021050005636')

   Drill evaluates the results of the subquery at runtime. The subquery
   yields a list of rowkeys from the TableIMSI table. Drill pushes down
   the list of rowkeys to MapR Database. MapR Database uses the rowkeys to
   locate the corresponding documents in the MixTable table and sends the
   results to Drill.
   Note: Currently, Drill does not support runtime filters for queries
   with equality conditions. The query planner in Drill converts an
   equality condition to a left join. As a workaround, use the IN operator
   instead of the equality (=) operator for queries in which you want
   Drill to push down the rowkey filter to MapR Database.
   Drill does not perform runtime filter pushdown for queries that filter
   on rowkeys in small fact tables when the rowcount is generated from the
   right side of the join. true true|false
   planner.rowkeyjoin_conversion_selectivity_threshold Introduced in Drill
   1.13. Sets the selectivity (as a percentage) under which Drill uses a
   rowkey join for eligible queries. 0.01 Range: 0.0-1.0
   planner.rowkeyjoin_conversion_using_hashjoin Introduced in Drill 1.13.
   When enabled, Drill uses the hash join operator instead of a rowkey
   join. false true|false
   planner.index.covering_selectivity_threshold For covering indexes, this
   option specifies the filter selectivity that corresponds to the leading
   prefix of the index below which the index is considered for planning.
   For example, for the filter ‘a > 10 AND b < 20’ if an index has indexed
   fields (a, b, c) and the combined selectivity of the above condition is
   less than the threshold, the index is considered for the query plan.
   0.75 0 - 1.0
   planner.index.noncovering_selectivity_threshold For non-covering
   indexes, this option specifies the filter selectivity that corresponds
   to the leading prefix of the index below which the index is considered
   for planning. 0.025 0 - 1.0
   planner.index.max_chosen_indexes_per_table The maximum number of
   “chosen” indexes for a table after index costing and ranking. 5 0 - 100
   planner.index.rowkeyjoin_cost_factor The cost factor that provides some
   control over the I/O cost for non-covering indexes when the rowkey join
   back to the primary table causes random I/O from the primary table. 0.1
   0 - max_double
   planner.enable_statistics Enable or disable statistics for the filter
   conditions on indexed columns. true true|false
   exec.query.rowkeyjoin_batchsize For batch GET operations, this option
   specifies the batch size in terms of the number of rowkeys. Used for
   non-covering index plans when doing joins back to primary table. 128 0
   - Long.MAX_VALUE
   exec.query.progress.update Enable or disable updating transient query
   state in ZooKeeper. Disable this option for short running operational
   queries. When disabled, you do not see the query state , such as
   STARTING and RUNNING in the Drill Web Console. true true|false
   exec.udf.use_dynamic Enable or disable using dynamic UDFs for the
   queries. Disable this option for operational queries. When disabled,
   you cannot use dynamic UDFs for queries. true true|false
   exec.query_profile.save Enable or disable saving query profiles for the
   queries. Disable this option for operational queries. When disabled,
   Drill does not save query profiles and they are not available for
   analysis or debugging. true true|false
   planner.use_simple_optimizer Enable or disable using simple optimizer
   for queries. Simple optimizer applies fewer rules to reduce planning
   time and is meant to be used only for simple operational queries that
   use limit, sort, and filter. This optimizer applies rules for
   leveraging secondary indexes when index planning is enabled. Enable
   this option for operational queries. false true|false
