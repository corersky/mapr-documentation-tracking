Index Planning in Drill

   Index planning reduces the I/O operation costs associated with full
   table scans. If an index is available, Drill can use the index to
   improve query performance.
   Drill can use indexes to create query plans for queries that filter on
   indexed fields or fields included in an index. Fields in COUNT, COUNT
   DISTINCT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY also determine index use. Drill
   can create index-based query plans for queries with and without filters
   (WHERE clause).
   Note: In Drill 1.11 and earlier, if a query does not have a filter, the
   query must have an ORDER BY clause.
   Drill can create index plans for queries with an ORDER BY clause
   whether or not the query contains a filter, as shown in the following
   example:
SELECT L_LINENUMBER FROM lineitem ORDER BY L_LINENUMBER;

   Note: In this example, L_LINENUMBER is an indexed field in the index
   selected for the query plan.
   In Drill 1.12 and later, Drill can also create index-based query plans
   for the following types of queries when they do not have filters (WHERE
   clause):
     * GROUP BY queries, as shown in the following example where
       L_COMMITDate is an indexed field in the index selected for the
       query plan:
SELECT L_COMMITDate FROM lineitem GROUP BY L_COMMITDate;
     * JOIN queries, as shown in the following example where L_ORDERKEY
       and O_ORDERKEY are indexed fields and L_LINESTATUS is an included
       field in the index selected for the query plan:
SELECT L.L_LINESTATUS FROM lineitem L, orders O WHERE L.L_ORDERKEY=O.O_ORDERKEY;
       Note: If the planner picks two indexes, one for lineitem and one
       for orders, a sort merge join is used instead of a hash join.
     * Queries with DISTINCT projections, as shown in the following
       examples where L_LINENUMBER is an indexed field in the index
       selected for the query plan:
SELECT DISTINCT L_LINENUMBER FROM lineitem;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT L_LINENUMBER) FROM lineitem;

   Drill can use indexes for queries that GROUP BY or ORDER BY the leading
   fields in an index. Drill does not use indexes for queries that GROUP
   BY or ORDER BY the trailing or included fields in an index.

   When a query contains GROUP BY and ORDER BY operations on the leading
   indexed column, Drill can use the sort order of the index to create
   index-based query plans that use streaming aggregates and merge joins
   to improve query performance.

   You can run the [1]EXPLAIN PLAN FOR command with a query to see the
   query plan that Drill creates. See [2]Covering and Non-Covering Queries
   for more information about index planning in Drill.
