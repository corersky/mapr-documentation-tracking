Configure SSL Encryption for Spark on YARN

   Starting in MEP 6.0.0, you can remove spark.ssl.keyStorePassword,
   spark.ssl.trustStorePassword, and spark.ssl.keyPassword from the
   spark-defaults.conf file for addittional security. These passwords are
   stored in the /opt/mapr/conf/ssl-client.xml file and Spark can access
   passwords from this file itself.
   Note: If passwords are present in both /opt/mapr/conf/ssl-client.xml
   and /opt/mapr/spark/spark-2.3.1/conf/spark-defaults.conf files, then
   the password from the spark-defaults.conf file is used.
   Complete the following step to manually configure encryption for the
   Spark HTTP file and broadcast servers:
   In the spark-defaults.conf file on each spark node, configure the
   following properties:
     * For Spark 2.0.1 and later:
spark.ssl.fs.enabled true
spark.ssl.keyPassword <ssl-keystore-password>
spark.ssl.keyStore /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore
spark.ssl.keyStorePassword <ssl-keystore-password>
spark.ssl.trustStore /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore
spark.ssl.trustStorePassword <ssl-keystore-password>
spark.ssl.protocol TLSv1.2
spark.ssl.enabledAlgorithms TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CB
C_SHA
       Note: Starting in MEP 4.0, for secure clusters, you can skip this
       step. For new installs done through the 6.0 MapR Installer, the
       installer enables this configuration. For manual installs and
       upgrades, [1]running configure.sh -R, as the final step in the
       configuration process, enables these settings.
     * For Spark 1.6.1:
spark.ssl.akka.enabled true
spark.ssl.fs.enabled true
spark.ssl.keyPassword <ssl-keystore-password>
spark.ssl.keyStore /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore
spark.ssl.keyStorePassword <ssl-keystore-password>
spark.ssl.trustStore /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore
spark.ssl.trustStorePassword <ssl-keystore-password>
spark.ssl.protocol TLSv1.2
spark.ssl.enabledAlgorithms TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CB
C_SHA

   Spark UI SSL is not needed when running Spark on YARN because
   encryption is provided by the YARN protocol. For versions prior to MEP
   4.1.0, to enable users logged in with a normal user account (not mapr
   or root) to run spark jobs on the cluster, disable Spark SSL for
   Spark-on-YARN jobs. To disable Spark SSL, add spark.ssl.ui.enabled
   false to the spark-defaults.conf file on each spark node. The
   spark-defaults.conf file is in the following location:
   /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/conf/. Make sure SSL is enabled for the
   Spark history server.
   Note: When you manually configure encryption for Spark, set the same
   protocol and algorithms for each node. Otherwise, the connection
   between those components might fail.
