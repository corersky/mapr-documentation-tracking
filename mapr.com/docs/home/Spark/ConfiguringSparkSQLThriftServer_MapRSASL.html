Configuring Spark Thrift Server with MapR-SASL

   You can configure Spark Thrift server to use MapR-SASL for its
   communications with various components on a secure MapR cluster.
   Minimal configuration is required.
   Note: Starting in MEP 4.0, for secure clusters, you can skip the steps
   outlined in this section. For new installs done through the 6.0 MapR
   Installer, the installer enables this configuration. For manual
   installs and upgrades, [1]running configure.sh -R enables these
   settings.

   To manually enable MapR-SASL authentication on a non-secure cluster or
   in versions earlier than MEP 4.0:
    1. Set the hive.server2.authentication property in hive-site.xml to
       the value, MAPRSASL.
<property>
     <name>hive.server2.authentication</name>
     <value>MAPRSASL</value>
</property>
    2. Restart Spark Thrift server to apply this change. sbin is in your
       Spark directory at /opt/mapr/spark/spark-2.1.0/.
       Important: The MapR administrative user (generally, the account
       named mapr) should start Spark Thrift server. Then, process
       identifier (PID) files will be owned by this user, and
       impersonation support (where applicable) will function correctly.
./sbin/stop-thriftserver.sh
./sbin/start-thriftserver.sh
