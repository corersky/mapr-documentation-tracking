Security with Spark Standalone

   Starting in the MEP 4.0 release, for secure clusters, you no longer
   need to manually configure your cluster to enable Spark security
   features. Using the MapR installer for new installations or running
   configure.sh -R for manual installs and upgrades automatically enables
   security features on secure clusters. See [1]Spark configure.sh for
   details, including instructions on how to avoid enabling security
   features on secure clusters.

   When running Spark applications on a secure cluster, you must pass the
   -Dmapr_sec_enabled flag to Spark. For secure clusters, this flag is set
   in spark-env.sh. For situations where your Spark application does not
   invoke this script, e.g., a Spark web service, you must manually pass
   the flag.
