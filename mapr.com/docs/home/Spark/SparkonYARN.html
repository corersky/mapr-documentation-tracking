Spark on YARN

   This section contains topics about installing, configuring and using
   Spark on YARN.
   Important: Spark 2.0.1 (and later) YARN mode is supported only on
   clusters in MRv2 (YARN) mode. It is not supported on clusters in MRv1
   (classic) mode.

   To integrate Spark with other ecosystem components, see [1]Integrating
   Spark

   For additional documentation, see the [2]Apache Spark documentation.
