Understanding the MapR Database OJAI Connector for Spark

   Using the MapR Database OJAI connector for Spark enables you build
   real-time and batch pipelines between your data and MapR Database JSON.
   Before getting started, it is important that you understand Spark
   terminology and workflow, system requirements and support, and OJAI
   connector and API features.

   The MapR Database OJAI connector includes a set of APIs that enable you
   to write applications that consume MapR Database JSON tables and use
   them in Spark. The MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark is a
   companion to the [1]MapR Database Binary Connector for Apache Spark,
   which provides the equivalent functionality for MapR Database Binary
   tables.

MapR Database OJAI Connector with Spark Workflow

   You can use the MapR Database OJAI Connector to extract data from MapR
   Database or MapR Filesystem and transform that data using either Spark
   or Spark SQL, and then load it into MapR Database JSON:

MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark Features

   Principal features of the MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark
   include the following:
     * Support for Scala and, beginning with MEP 4.1, Java and Python APIs
       This matrix shows the programming languages and features supported:

                 Scala Java Python
       RDD       Yes   Yes  No
       DataFrame Yes   Yes  Yes
       Dataset   Yes   Yes  No
       DStream   Yes   No   No
     * APIs that enable you to load data from a MapR Database JSON table
       to an Apache Spark RDD, DataFrame, or Dataset
     * Projection and filter pushdown for better performance
     * Custom partitioner for RDDs that enables you to partition data for
       better performance
     * APIs that save an Apache Spark RDD, DataFrame, or DStream to a MapR
       Database JSON table using either normal or bulk insert
     * Support for Scala and Java bean classes
     * Support for data locality

   The following features are not supported:
     * MapR Database Binary tables
       Only MapR Database JSON tables are supported; access to MapR
       Database binary tables is provided through the MapR Database Binary
       Connector.
     * Secondary indexes

Supported Product Versions and System Requirements

   To use the MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark, you must have
   the following minimum software versions:
     * MapR: 5.2.1 or later
     * MEP 3.0 or later
     * Spark 2.1.0 or later
     * Scala 2.11 or later
     * Java 8 or later

   Support for DataFrames and Datasets is available starting in the MEP
   4.0 release.

OJAI API

   The MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark uses the [2]OJAI API
   internally to access MapR Database JSON tables.
