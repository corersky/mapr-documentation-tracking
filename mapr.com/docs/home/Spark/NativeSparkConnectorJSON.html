Understanding the MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Spark

   Using the MapR-DB OJAI connector for Spark enables you build real-time
   and batch pipelines between your data and MapR-DB JSON. Before getting
   started, it is important that you understand Spark terminology and
   workflow, system requirements and support, and OJAI connector and API
   features.

   Included is a set of APIs that enable MapR users to write applications
   that consume MapR-DB JSON tables and use them in Spark. The MapR-DB
   OJAI Connector for Apache Spark is a companion to the [1]MapR-DB Binary
   Connector for Apache Spark, which provides the equivalent functionality
   for MapR-DB Binary tables.

Sample Batch Data Transformation Spark Workflow

   You can use the MapR-DB OJAI Connector with batch data. In this
   diagram, data from MapR-DB or MapR-FS is extracted and transformed
   using either Spark or Spark SQL, and then loaded into MapR-DB JSON:

MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark Features

   Principal features of the MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark
   include the following:
     * Support for Scala and, beginning with MEP 4.1, Java and Python APIs
     * APIs that enable you to load data from a MapR-DB JSON table to an
       Apache Spark RDD, DataFrame, or Dataset
     * Projection and filter pushdown for better performance
     * Custom partitioner for RDDs that enables you to partition data for
       better performance
     * APIs that save an Apache Spark RDD, DataFrame, or DStream to a
       MapR-DB JSON table using either normal or bulk insert
     * Support for Scala and Java bean classes
     * Data locality

   The following features are not supported:
     * MapR-DB Binary tables
       Only MapR-DB JSON tables are supported; access to MapR-DB binary
       tables is provided through the MapR-DB Binary Connector.
     * Secondary indexes

   This matrix shows the programming languages and features supported:
             Scala Java Python
   RDD       Yes   Yes  No
   DataFrame Yes   Yes  Yes
   Dataset   Yes   Yes  No
   DStream   Yes   No   No
   Note: Examples for topics include Scala, Java, and Python
   implementations. If any of these implementations are missing, the
   feature is not supported for that language.

Supported Product Versions and System Requirements

   To use the MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark, you must have the
   following minimum software versions:
     * MapR: 5.2.1 or later
     * MEP 3.0 or later
     * Spark 2.1.0 or later
     * Scala 2.11 or later
     * Java 8 or later

   Support for DataFrames and Datasets is available starting in the MEP
   4.0 release.

OJAI API

   The MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark uses the [2]OJAI API
   internally to access MapR-DB JSON tables.
