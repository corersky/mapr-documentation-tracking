Understanding the MapR Database OJAI Connector for Spark

   Using the MapR Database OJAI connector for Spark enables you build
   real-time and batch pipelines between your data and MapR Database JSON.
   Before getting started, it is important that you understand Spark
   terminology and workflow, system requirements and support, and OJAI
   connector and API features.

   Included is a set of APIs that enable MapR users to write applications
   that consume MapR Database JSON tables and use them in Spark. The MapR
   Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark is a companion to the [1]MapR
   Database Binary Connector for Apache Spark, which provides the
   equivalent functionality for MapR Database Binary tables.

Sample Batch Data Transformation Spark Workflow

   You can use the MapR Database OJAI Connector with batch data. In this
   diagram, data from MapR Database or MapR Filesystem is extracted and
   transformed using either Spark or Spark SQL, and then loaded into MapR
   Database JSON: [OJAIConnectorForSpark.png]

MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark Features

   Principal features of the MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark
   include the following:
     * Support for Scala and, beginning with MEP 4.1, Java and Python APIs
     * APIs that enable you to load data from a MapR Database JSON table
       to an Apache Spark RDD, DataFrame, or Dataset
     * Projection and filter pushdown for better performance
     * Custom partitioner for RDDs that enables you to partition data for
       better performance
     * APIs that save an Apache Spark RDD, DataFrame, or DStream to a MapR
       Database JSON table using either normal or bulk insert
     * Support for Scala and Java bean classes
     * Data locality

   The following features are not supported:
     * MapR Database Binary tables
       Only MapR Database JSON tables are supported; access to MapR
       Database binary tables is provided through the MapR Database Binary
       Connector.
     * Secondary indexes

   This matrix shows the programming languages and features supported:
             Scala Java Python
   RDD       Yes   Yes  No
   DataFrame Yes   Yes  Yes
   Dataset   Yes   Yes  No
   DStream   Yes   No   No
   Note: Examples for topics include Scala, Java, and Python
   implementations. If any of these implementations are missing, the
   feature is not supported for that language.

Supported Product Versions and System Requirements

   To use the MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark, you must have
   the following minimum software versions:
     * MapR: 5.2.1 or later
     * MEP 3.0 or later
     * Spark 2.1.0 or later
     * Scala 2.11 or later
     * Java 8 or later

   Support for DataFrames and Datasets is available starting in the MEP
   4.0 release.

OJAI API

   The MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark uses the [2]OJAI API
   internally to access MapR Database JSON tables.
