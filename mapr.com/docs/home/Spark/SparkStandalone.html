Spark Standalone

   This section includes topics about configuring and using Spark in
   Standalone mode.
   Important: Spark 2.0.1 (and later) Standalone mode is supported only on
   clusters in MRv2 (YARN) mode. It is not supported on clusters in MRv1
   (classic) mode. MRv1 is deprecated for MapR 6.0.

   To integrate Spark with other ecosystem components, see [1]Integrating
   Spark.

   For additional documentation, see the [2]Apache Spark website.
