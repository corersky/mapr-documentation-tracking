Using Authentication with Spark Thrift Server

   Spark Thrift server supports both MapR-SASL and Kerberos
   authentication. The authentication method that you configure for the
   Spark Thrift server determines how the connection is secured. Clients
   might require additional configuration and specific connection strings
   based on the authentication type.

   To enable authentication, see:
     * [1]Configuring Spark Thrift Server with MapR-SASL
     * [2]Configuring Spark Thrift Server with Kerberos

   To configure PAM for Spark Thriftserver, run configure.sh on the secure
   cluster.
