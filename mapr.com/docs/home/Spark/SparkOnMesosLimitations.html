Spark on Mesos Limitations

   This section describes the features Apache Spark on Apache Mesos does
   not support.

   Spark on Mesos has the following limitations:
    1. Does not support secure clusters, both Kerberos and MapR-SASL.
    2. Does not support integration with Oozie. See
       [1]https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-2477 for details.
    3. Does not support integration with Hue in cluster deployment mode.
    4. Only certified on CentOS.
    5. Cluster deployment mode does not support use of run-example. You
       can run spark examples using spark-submit. For example, to run the
       SparkPi example:
/opt/mapr/spark/spark-2.1.0/bin/spark-submit\
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi\
  --master mesos://<node where dispatcher is running>:7077\
  --deploy-mode cluster\
  maprfs:///user/mapr/spark-examples_2.11-2.1.0-mapr-SNAPSHOT.jar
