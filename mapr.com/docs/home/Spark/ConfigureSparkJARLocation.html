Configure Spark JAR Location (Spark 1.6.1)

   By default, Spark on YARN uses a Spark JAR file that is installed
   locally. The Spark JAR file can also be added to a world-readable
   location on MapR-FS. When you add the JAR file to a world-readable
   location, YARN can cache it on nodes to avoid distributing it each time
   an application runs. Complete the following steps to add the Spark JAR
   file to a world-readable location on MapR-FS:
    1. Copy the following JAR file from the local file system to a
       world-readable location on MapR-FS: Substitute your Spark version
       and specific JAR file name in the command.
/opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/lib/spark-assembly-<version>-hadoop<version>-map
r-<version>.jar
    2. Set the spark.yarn.jar property in the spark-defaults.conf file to
       point to the world-readable location where you added the Spark JAR
       file. For example:
spark.yarn.jar      maprfs:///<path to jar>
