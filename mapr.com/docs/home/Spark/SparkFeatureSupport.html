Spark Feature Support

   MapR supports most Spark features. However, there a few exceptions.

   Spark Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server Support
          Running the Spark Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server on a secure cluster is
          supported only on Spark 2.1.0 or later.
          You can run the Spark Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server to enable
          connections to Hive 1.2.1 using Beeline; however, you can
          connect only to Hive versions supported by your Spark version.

   Spark SQL and Hive Support for Spark 2.1.0
          Spark 2.1.0 is able to connect to Hive 2.1 Metastore; however,
          only features of Hive 1.2 are supported.

   Spark SQL and Hive Support for Spark 2.0.1
          Spark SQL is supported, but it is not fully compatible with
          Hive. For details, see the [1]Apache Spark documentation.

          The following Hive functions are not supported in Spark SQL:

          + Tables with buckets
          + UNION type
          + Unique join
          + Column statistics collecting
          + Output formats: File format (for CLI), Hadoop Archive
          + Block-level bitmap indexes and virtual columns
          + Automatic determination of the number of reducers for JOIN and
            GROUP BY
          + Metadata-only query
          + Skew data flag
          + STREAMTABLE hint in JOIN
          + Merging of multiple small files for query results

   Spark SQL and Hive Support for Spark 1.6.1
          Spark SQL is supported, but it is not fully compatible with
          Hive. For details, see the [2]Apache Spark documentation. The
          following Spark SQL operations support the following Hive table
          formats:
