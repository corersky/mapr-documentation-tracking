Prerequisites for Using Structured Streaming in Spark

   To deploy a structured streaming application in Spark, you must create
   a MapR Streams topic and install a Kafka client on all nodes in your
   cluster.

Creating a MapR Streams Topic

   Create a MapR Streams topic consisting of the stream path and topic
   name separated by a colon (:); for example, /test_stream:topic1.

Installing a Kafka Client

   Install a kafka-client on all nodes of your cluster, or copy the
   kafka-clients.jar file from
   /opt/mapr/lib/kafka-clients-1.0.1-mapr-1803.jar to
   /opt/mapr/spark/spark-<version>/jars/.
