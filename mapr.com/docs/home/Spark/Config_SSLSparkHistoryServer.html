Spark History Server SSL

   Describes how to enable SSL for Spark History Server.

   Starting in MEP 4.0, for secure clusters, you can skip this step. For
   new installs done through the 6.0 MapR Installer, the installer enables
   this configuration. For manual installs and upgrades, [1]running
   configure.sh -R enables these settings.

   To configure SSL manually in a non-secure cluster or in versions
   earlier than MEP 4.0, add the following properties to the
   spark-default.conf file:
#HistoryServer https configure
spark.yarn.historyServer.address <Spark History Server node hostname>:18480

spark.ssl.protocol tls
spark.ssl.historyServer.enabled true
spark.ssl.trustStore $MAPR_HOME/conf/ssl_truststore
spark.ssl.keyStore $MAPR_HOME/conf/ssl_keystore
spark.ssl.trustStorePassword <ssl-keystore-password>
spark.ssl.keyStorePassword <ssl-keystore-password>

   Note: If a cluster is secure and you use unsecured ports with HTTP, you
   will be automatically redirected to HTTPS with secure ports. For
   example, if on the secure cluster you go to http://node1:18080, you
   will be redirected to https://node1:18480.
