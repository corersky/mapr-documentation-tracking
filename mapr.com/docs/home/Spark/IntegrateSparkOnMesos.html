Integrating Spark on Mesos

   This section describes the components Apache Spark on Apache Mesos
   supports and how to integrate with those components.
   Spark on Mesos supports integration with the following components:
     * Hive (via Spark-SQL)
     * MapR Database (binary tables only)
     * HBase
     * MapR Streams
     * Hue
     * R

   To integrate Spark and Mesos with these components, see [1]Integrating
   Spark.
   Note: Spark on Mesos does not support integration with Oozie. See
   [2]https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE-2477 for additional
   details.
