MapR Database Binary Connector for Apache Spark

   This section describes the three main interaction points between Spark
   and HBase APIs and provides examples for each interaction point.

   The interaction points are:
   Basic Spark You can have an HBase Connection at any point in your Spark
   DAG.
   Spark Streaming You can have an HBase Connection at any point in your
   Spark Streaming application.
   Spark Bulk Load This option is currently not supported for MapR
   Database.
   SparkSQL/DataFrames You can write SparkSQL that draws on tables that
   are represented in HBase.

   The following pages provide examples of each of these interaction
   points.
