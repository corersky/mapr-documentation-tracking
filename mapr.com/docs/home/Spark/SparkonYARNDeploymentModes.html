Deployment Modes

   Spark is preconfigured for YARN and does not require any additional
   configuration to run.

   Two deployment modes can be used to launch Spark applications on YARN:
     * In cluster mode, jobs are managed by the YARN cluster. The Spark
       driver runs inside an Application Master (AM) process that is
       managed by YARN. This means that the client can go away after
       initiating the application.
     * In client mode, the Spark driver runs in the client process, and
       the Application Master is used only to request resources from YARN.

   MapR recommends using cluster deployment mode instead of client mode.
   If the Spark client that runs the job exits after submitting the job,
   there is no impact on job completion.
   Note: In cluster deployment mode, the local directories used by the
   Spark executors and the Spark driver are the local directories that are
   configured for YARN (yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs).
   Note: SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS is ignored when you run Spark on YARN.
