Spark SQL Thrift Server

   Spark SQL Thrift (Spark Thrift) was developed from Apache Hive
   HiveServer2 and operates like HiveSever2 Thrift server. It is supported
   on secure clusters. You can run the Spark Thrift server and connect to
   Hive versions supported by Spark 2.1.0 with Business Intelligence (BI)
   tools or the Beeline command-line tool.

   Starting in the MEP 4.0 release, the Spark Thrift server is available
   as a separate package. For instructions about installing this package,
   see [1]Installing Spark Standalone or [2]Installing Spark on YARN,
   depending on the type of cluster manager you are installing.

   In MEP 3.0, MapR introduces additional security mechanisms for Spark
   with the Spark Thrift server. MapR-SASL and Kerberos are supported:
     * For JDBC connections into Spark Thrift server
     * Between Spark and Hive metastore

   To enable these security mechanisms for the Spark Thrift server,
   starting in the MEP 4.0 release, for secure clusters, running
   [3]configure.sh -R configures MapR-SASL security. The script modifies
   or creates a SPARK_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml file as follows:
     * If Hive installed in your cluster, the script copies
       HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml to SPARK_HOME/conf and modifies the
       file.
     * If Hive is not installed and you are using MapR-SASL security, the
       script creates a new SPARK_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml file.
     * Each time the script runs, if there is a pre-existing
       SPARK_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml file, the script saves a copy of the
       file in SPARK_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml.old before modifying it.

   You can manually configure security by following the steps outlined in
   sub-topics listed on this page.

   To launch Spark Thrift server, perform the procedures required to
   configure [4]Spark to use [5]Hive.
   Important: Starting in the MEP 4.0 release, if you start and stop the
   Spark Thrift server using Warden, the connection port number is 2304.
   If you start and stop by running the
   /opt/mapr/spark/<spark-version/sbin/{start,stop}-thriftserver.sh
   scripts, the port number remains 10000.

Default Behavior

   The default behavior of the Spark Thrift server is as follows:
    1. After installation, the Spark Thrift server is started in the local
       master mode.
    2. If the Spark master package is installed, then Spark Thrift server
       is started in the standalone master mode.
    3. If the spark.master property is set in the spark-defaults.conf
       file, then Spark Thrift server uses the master set by this
       property.

Known Limitations

     * MapR-SASL support is only implemented for Spark 2.1.0.
     * Username and password authentication through PAM is not supported
       in MEP 3.0.
     * Only SELECT statements support impersonation usage to access data
       stored in MapR Filesystem and/or MapR Database.
     * Spark Thrift server supports only features and commands in Hive
       1.2.
     * Although Spark 2.1.0 can connect to Hive 2.1 Metastore, only Hive
       1.2 features and commands are supported by Spark 2.1.0.
