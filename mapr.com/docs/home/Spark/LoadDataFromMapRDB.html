Loading Data from MapR Database Using the MapR Database OJAI Connector for
Apache Spark

   The MapR Database OJAI Connector for Apache Spark supports loading data
   as an Apache Spark RDD. Starting in the MEP 4.0 release, the connector
   introduces support for Apache Spark DataFrames and Datasets. DataFrames
   and Datasets perform better than RDDs. Whether you load your MapR
   Database data as a DataFrame or Dataset depends on the APIs you prefer
   to use. It is also possible to convert an RDD to a DataFrame.
