Spark configure.sh

   Starting in the MEP 4.0 release, run configure.sh -R to complete your
   Spark configuration when manually installing Spark or upgrading to a
   new version.

   The command is the following:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R

   Note: You do not need to run this script for new installs, if you are
   using the MapR installer in MEP 4.0 or later.

   In the case of [1]Spark Standalone and [2]Spark on YARN, this is the
   last step in the configuration process. In the case of [3]Spark on
   Mesos, run the script as the first step in [4]Configuring Spark on
   Mesos. Running this script enables Spark security features if you have
   enabled security on your cluster.
   All security configuration properties are specified within the
   following comment block in the SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
   file:
#SECURITY BLOCK
...
#END OF THE SECURITY CONFIGURATION BLOCK

   Important: Do not remove these comments from the file, as well as any
   other comments within the block inserted by configure.sh. The script
   uses these comments to locate security properties.
   Note: To set ports to special values, use the spark.driver.port and
   spark.blockManager.port properties.

   Starting in MEP 6.0.0, Spark services such as the History Server,
   Thrift Server, or Master are restarted by configure.sh only for changes
   to the following Spark configuration files: spark-defaults.conf,
   spark-env.sh, hive-site.xml, or log4j.properties. If these files are
   unchanged, configure.sh does not restart any of the Spark services.

   An update to Spark causes the conf directory from the previous the
   Spark version to be saved to the spark-<old-version>.<old-timestamp>
   directory. If your Spark version did not change during the update, then
   configurations from the spark-<old-version>.<old-timestamp> directory
   is automatically copied to the spark-<version> directory by the
   configure.sh script.

   If you use .customSecure, at the first run, the configure.sh script
   copies the hive-site.xml file from Hive. For subsequent times, the
   hive-site.xml file is not copied from Hive and you would need to
   manually modify the /opt/mapr/spark/spark-2.3.1/conf/hive-site.xml
   file.
