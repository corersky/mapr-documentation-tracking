Consuming CDC Records

   The OJAI changelog interfaces are used to consume changed data records
   (propagated by the Change Data Capture feature).

   The general CDC flow of understanding architectural concepts,
   performing administrative tasks to set up and use CDC, performing CRUD
   operatons on a database table, and developing applications for
   consuming CDC changed data records. This diagram provides hotspot links
   to help you navigate to the applicable documentation.

   See the following Java documentation for detailed information about CDC
   APIs.

   [2]Java OJAI CDC API

Deserializer for consuming CDC records

   The deserializer converts stream messages into individual change data
   records. When your application creates a CDC consumer, you must also
   register the MapR ChangeData deserializer by setting the
   value.deserializer configuration parameter to
   com.mapr.db.cdc.ChangeDataRecordDeserializer.
   Note: When applications consume from a CDC change topic, the record key
   retrieved from poll() is not deserialized. The record key is not equal
   to the _id field of the document. If you want to retrieve the exact _id
   of the document, you must call the ChangeDataRecord.getId() method.

Interfaces for working with CDC records

   The following OJAI interfaces and enumerations create consumers for CDC
   changed data.

   [3]ChangeNode
          Contains the change to a single field in a document.

   [4]ChangeEvent
          Identifies the change event associated with the current change
          node. The value of ChangeEvent can be one of the following:

          + NULL (no event)
          + NODE (a change with real value)
          + START_MAP (a node representing the beginning of a map)
          + END_MAP (a node representing the end of a map)
          + START_ARRAY (a node representing the beginning of an array)
          + END_ARRAY (a node representing the end of an array)

   [5]ChangeOp
          Identifies the type of the operation performed on the current
          field. The values of ChangeOp can be one of the following:

          + NULL (no operation)
          + SET (replace the current field with the given value)
          + PUT (add an extra version of the value)
          + MERGE (combine the given value with the existing values in the
            table)
          + DELETE (delete all values older than or equal to the delete
            operation timestamp)
          + DELETE_EXACT (delete the version of the value with the given
            timestamp)

   [6]ChangeDataRecord
          Contains all the changes made on a single document/row in the
          source table.

   [7]ChangeDataRecordType
          Specifies the mode of change for the change data record. The
          following values are specified:

          + RECORD_INSERT
          + RECORD_UPDATE
          + RECORD_DELETE

   [8]ChangeDataReader
          Is a parser that traverses over the individual change tree nodes
          on a change data record. It provides cursor-like semantics that
          can be moved, one tree node at a time, by invoking the next
          method. The APIs retrieve the properties of individual change
          nodes (for example: data type, field name, field value, and so
          on).

Open Data Format

   The MapR CDC Open Format feature allows you to create applications in
   languages other then Java that consume CDC (Change Data Capture)
   changed data records. For example, C/C++, Python, and C#/.NET) are
   supported.

   This functionality is provided with an open format decoder/serializer
   in the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C library. The decoder
   translates the MapR internal format to the open data format,
   decodes/deserializes the data, and returns the value of the changed
   data record as a human readable JSON string.

   All languages that are binding through the MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka C library can retrieve the open data format and, with a simple
   JSON parser, consume changed data records.
