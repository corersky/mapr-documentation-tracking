Modes of Publishing

   Describes different modes of publishing.

   When publishing a message, a producer sends a record to the producer
   client library. The producer client library batches messages into
   multiple publish requests which are sent to the MapR-ES server.

At Least Once

   The default message delivery semantics is "at-least-one". At-least-once
   means that the message delivery guarantees that a message is published
   at least once to the MapR-ES server. Messages are never lost but may be
   re-delivered.

Server Acknowledgements

   By default, publishing requests for messages are sent without waiting
   for acknowledgement (ack) from the MapR-ES server.

   The acknowledgement behavior is determined by the producer
   configuration parameter streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition, which
   defaults to true.

   With an "at-least-once" message delivery, in some failure scenarios, a
   message can be produced more than once for a single send call. A common
   reason for message duplication is when a network error occurs, a client
   may retry sending a message to a server node.If the network error
   occurs after the message is processed and persisted by the server, it
   can lead to duplicate messages in the system.

   Publishing without Ack
          When publishing without ack (default), it is possible for
          messages to be published to the partitions out of order due to
          the presence of multiple network interface controllers, network
          errors, or retries.

          For example, suppose a producer is sending messages that are
          specifically for Partition 1. The producer client library
          buffers the messages and sends a batch to Partition 1.
          Meanwhile, the producer keeps sending messages for Partition 1
          and the client continues to buffer them. The next time the
          producer client library has enough messages for Partition 1, the
          client sends another batch, whether or not the MapR-ES server
          has acknowledged the previous batch.

   Publishing with Ack
          If you always want messages to arrive to partitions in the order
          in which they were sent, set the configuration parameter
          streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition to false. This causes
          the producer client library to wait for ack (acknowledgements)
          from the MapR-ES server before sending subsequent publish
          requests.
