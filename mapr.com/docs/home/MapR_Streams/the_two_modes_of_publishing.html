Modes of Publishing

   Describes different modes of publishing.

   When publishing a message, a producer sends a record to the producer
   client library. The producer client library batches messages into
   multiple publish requests which are sent to the MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka server.

At Least Once

   The default message delivery semantics is "at-least-one". At-least-once
   means that the message delivery guarantees that a message is published
   at least once to the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server. Messages
   are never lost but may be re-delivered.

Exactly Once

   An "exactly once" message delivery semantics produces messages without
   duplication. Each message is delivered once and only once. Exactly once
   is insured by uniquely identifying a group of messages that are
   atomically persisted. Exactly once message delivery is set with the
   producer idempotence option.
   Note: Exactly-once message deliver semantics is enabled by setting the
   producer configurable option, enable.idempotence to true. By supporting
   an idempotent producer, retries no longer introduce duplicates. See
   [1]Enabling an Idempotent Producer for more information.
   The following unique identifiers are associated with each message:
     * Producer ID - A unique identifier is generated internally for each
       client and group of messages that are atomically persisted.
       As a minimum, the ID is a unique ID for a given
       stream-topic-partition. Producer IDs expire if a producer ID is
       inactive for a period of time. The default Producer ID expiration
       is 7 days. At that point, a new Producer Id is requested once the
       Producer ID is expired. To change the expiration date, see the
       pidexpirysecs parameter in maprcli [2]stream create and [3]stream
       edit for more information.
     * Sequence Number - A number that is monotonically incremented on
       every produced group of messages for the given Producer ID,
       assigned when received, and generated internally.

   Note: If the producer idempotence option, is not set to true, then "at
   least once" message delivery semantics applies.

   If the client resends a message after the producer ID has expired, then
   UnknownProducerIdException is thrown.
   For example:
     * If message1 from clientA is sent to a stream-topic-partition0 and 7
       days go by, the Producer ID expires.
     * Then, if clientA sends another message that has the exact same data
       to the same stream-topic-partition (stream-topic-partition0), then
       UnknownProducerIdException is thrown because the Producer ID has
       expired..

   Note: With the alternative "at least once" message delivery, in some
   failure scenarios, a message can be produced more than once for a
   single send call. Common reasons for message duplication include
   network error or server failure. For example, if a network error occurs
   and the message has been processed and persisted by the server, if the
   client re-tries sending a message to a server node, then the result
   could be duplicate messages in the system.

Server Acknowledgements

   By default, publishing requests for messages are sent without waiting
   for acknowledgement (ack) from the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   server.

   The acknowledgement behavior is determined by the producer
   configuration parameter streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition, which
   defaults to true.

   With an "at-least-once" message delivery, in some failure scenarios, a
   message can be produced more than once for a single send call. A common
   reason for message duplication is when a network error occurs, a client
   may retry sending a message to a server node.If the network error
   occurs after the message is processed and persisted by the server, it
   can lead to duplicate messages in the system.

   Publishing without Ack
          When publishing without ack (default), it is possible for
          messages to be published to the partitions out of order due to
          the presence of multiple network interface controllers, network
          errors, or retries.

          For example, suppose a producer is sending messages that are
          specifically for Partition 1. The producer client library
          buffers the messages and sends a batch to Partition 1.
          Meanwhile, the producer keeps sending messages for Partition 1
          and the client continues to buffer them. The next time the
          producer client library has enough messages for Partition 1, the
          client sends another batch, whether or not the MapR Event Store
          For Apache Kafka server has acknowledged the previous batch.

   Publishing with Ack
          If you always want messages to arrive to partitions in the order
          in which they were sent, set the configuration parameter
          streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition to false. This causes
          the producer client library to wait for ack (acknowledgements)
          from the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server before sending
          subsequent publish requests.
