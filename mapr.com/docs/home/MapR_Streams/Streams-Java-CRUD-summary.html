Stream and Topic Operations Summary

   Provides a summary of stream topic operations and the interface, class,
   or method used for the operation.
   The following stream and topic operations is not an inclusive list, but
   a sampling. For detailed information, see the following libraries:
     * [1]MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Java API Library (6.1)
     * [2]Apache Kafka 1.1 APIs used with MapR Event Store For Apache
       Kafka (6.1)

   CAPTION: Table 1. Summary of Stream and Topic operations

   Operation Interface/Method Used
   Creating streams

   StreamDescriptor is used to set the attributes for streams that you
   plan to create.

   Admin.createStream(String streamPathAndName, StreamDescriptor desc) -
   create the stream.
   Editing stream attributes

   StreamDescriptor is used to edit the stream's attribute values.

   Admin.editStream(String streamPathAndName, StreamDescriptor desc) - set
   or modify the stream's attribute values.
   Retrieving the default timestamp type on a stream
   StreamDescriptor.getDefaultTimestampType() - retrieves the default
   timestamp type on the stream.
   Note: This method is new as of 6.0.1
   Sets the default timestamp type on a stream
   StreamDescriptor.setDefaultTimestampType(TimestampType logAppendTime) -
   sets the default timestamp type on the stream.
   Note: TimestampType Enum is new as of 6.0.1
   Deleting streams Admin.deleteStream(String streamPathAndName)
   Determining stream existence Admin.streamExists(String
   streamPathAndName) - determines whether a stream exists or not.
   Returns: true | false
   Note: This method is new as of 6.0.1
   Creating topics
   Admin.createTopic(String streamPathAndName, String topicName,
   TopicDescriptor desc) is used when creating a topic with the defaults
   for partitions and timestamp type.
   Note: TopicDescriptor is new as of 6.0.1

   Admin.createTopic(String streamPathAndName, String topicName) is used
   when accepting the default number of partitions.

   Admin.createTopic(String streamPathAndName, String topicName, int
   npartitions) - creates a topic with a specific number of partitions.
   Note: If you do not specify the number of partitions for a stream
   topic, the default number of partitions is inherited from the stream.
   Editing topics
   Admin.editTopic(String streamPathAndName, String topicName,
   TopicDescriptor desc) - sets the partitions and timestamp type
   attributes of a topic.
   Note: TopicDescriptor is new as of 6.0.1

   Admin.editTopic(String streamPathAndName, String topicName, int
   npartitions)
   Retrieving topic attributes Admin.getTopicDescriptor(String
   streamPathAndName, String topicName) - retrieves topic attributes.
   Note: This method is new as of 6.0.1
   Deleting topics Admin.deleteTopic(String streamPathAndName, String
   topicName) - deletes topics.
   Listing topics Admin.listTopics(String streamPathAndName) - lists all
   topics in a stream.
   Note: This method is new as of 6.0.1
   Counting topics Admin.countTopics(String streamPathAndName) - counts
   the number of topics in a stream.
   Gets/Sets topic timestamp type TopicDescriptor is used to retrieve the
   timestamp type attribute value of a topic.
   Note: TopicDescriptor is new as of 6.0.1

   TopicDescriptor.getTimestampType() - retrieves the default timestamp
   type of a topic.

   TopicDescriptor.setTimestampType(TimestampType timestampType) - sets
   the default timestamp type of a topic.
   Gets/Sets topic partitions TopicDescriptor is used to retrieve the
   partition attribute value of a topic.
   Note: TopicDescriptor is new as of 6.0.1

   TopicDescriptor.getPartitions() - retrieves the partitions of a topic.

   TopicDescriptor.setParitions(int numPartitions) - sets the partitions
   of a topic.
   Enabling and tuning log compaction TopicDescriptor is used to enable
   and tune log compaction at the stream-level.
     * setCompact(boolean compact) - sets log compaction.
     * getCompact() - returns true if log compaction is set on the stream.
     * setMinCompactionLagMS(long ts) - set the lag time (in milliseconds)
       that a message should remain uncompacted.
     * getMinCompactionLagMS() - retrieves the value of the lag time.
     * setDeleteRetentionMS(long ts) - sets the time (in milliseconds) for
       which deleted records are retained.
     * getDeleteRetentionMS() - returns the time value of which deleted
       records are retained.

   In addition, the Admin interface is used with the following method to
   set compaction at the topic-level:
     * compactTopic(java.lang.String streamPath, java.lang.String
       topicName)

   Enabling an Idempotent Producer The Producer interface along with the
   ProducerConfig class is used to enable idempotence (exact-once message
   delivery semantics) publishing.
