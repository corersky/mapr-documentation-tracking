   C applications can be developed for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   (as of MapR 5.2.1). The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client is a
   distribution of librdkafka that works with MapR Event Store For Apache

   The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client supports a majority of
   the librdkafka C APIs plus additional [1]configuration properties that
   are available only with MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka. When
   developing applications for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka or
   migrating Kafka applications to MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka, see
   the list of [2]librdkafka APIs Supported by MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka C Client which also describes API behavior. Reference
   [3]rdkafka.h for API signatures.
   When developing and running MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C
   applications, note the following:
     * You can create producers and high-level consumers. Low-level
       consumers are not supported.
     * Consuming or producing topics in a Kafka cluster is not supported.
     * As of MapR 6.0, the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka offset values
       start at 0.
     * MapR Security is supported. Kafka application-level security is not
       supported. See [4]Security.
     * User impersonation is not supported.

   CAUTION:
   As of MapR 6.1, the mapr-core package has a dependency on
   mapr-librdkafka. If the mapr-librdkafka package is installed, do not
   remove it manually. Doing so could result in the removal of MapR core
   packages, rendering the node unusable.
