MapR-ES C Applications

   C applications can be developed for MapR-ES (as of MapR 5.2.1). The
   MapR-ES C Client is a distribution of librdkafka that works with
   MapR-ES. The MapR-ES C Client is available in MapR Expansion Pack (MEP)
   3.0 or higher.
   The following Apache Kafka librdkafka versions are supported:

   CAPTION: Table 1. Supported Apache Kafka librdkafka versions

            MapR release          MEP Release Kafka librdkafka version
   As of MapR 6.0.1               As of 5.0   0.11.3
   As of MapR 5.2.1 through 6.0.0 As of 3.0   0.9.0

   The MapR-ES C Client supports a majority of the librdkafka C APIs plus
   additional [1]configuration properties that are available only with
   MapR-ES. When developing applications for MapR-ES or migrating Kafka
   applications to MapR-ES, see the list of [2]librdkafka APIs Supported
   by MapR-ES C Client which also describes API behavior. Reference
   [3]rdkafka.h for API signatures.
   When developing and running MapR-ES C applications, note the following:
     * You can create producers and high-level consumers. Low-level
       consumers are not supported.
     * Consuming or producing topics in a Kafka cluster is not supported.
     * As of MapR 6.0, the MapR-ES offset values start at 0.
     * MapR Security is supported. Kafka application-level security is not
       supported. See [4]Security .
     * User impersonation is not supported.
