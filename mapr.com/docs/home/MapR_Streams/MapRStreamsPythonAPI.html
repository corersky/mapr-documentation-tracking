API for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client

   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client is a binding for
   librdkafka and it supports the following APIs.

   As of MapR 5.2.1, you can create python applications for MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka using the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   Python client. The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python client is a
   binding for librdkafka and the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C
   Client is a distribution of librdkafka that works with MapR Event Store
   For Apache Kafka.

class mapr_streams_python.Consumer

   A high-level Kafka Consumer.
   Method Behavior
   Consumer(**kwargs) Create new Consumer instance using provided
   configuration dictionary.
   assign(partitions) Set consumer partition assignment to the provided
   list of TopicPartition and starts consuming.
   Parameters(s):
     * partitions (list(TopicPartition)) – List of topic+partitions and
       optionally initial offsets to start consuming

   unassign()

   Unassign from all TopicPartitions that have been assigned with the
   .assign(*topic_partition_list) method.
   Note: This method is applicable as of MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   Python Client MEP 5.0 which is associated with librdkafka 0.11.3.
   assignment()

   Return a list of assignments for a consumer object.
   Note: This method is applicable as of MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   Python Client MEP 5.0 which is associated with librdkafka 0.11.3.
   close() Close down and terminate the Kafka Consumer.
   Actions(s):
     * Stops consuming
     * Commits offsets
     * Leave consumer group

   commit([message=None][, offsets=None][, async=True])

   Commit a message or a list of offsets.

   Message and offsets are mutually exclusive, if neither is set the
   current partition assignment’s offsets are used instead.
   Parameters(s):
     * message (confluent_kafka.Message) – Commit message’s offset+1.
     * offsets (list(TopicPartition)) – List of topic+partitions+offsets
       to commit.
     * async (bool) – Asynchronous commit, return immediately.

   committed(partitions[, timeout=None])

   Retrieve committed offsets for the list of partitions.
   Parameters(s):
     * partitions (list(TopicPartition)) - List of topic+partitions to
       query for stored offsets.
     * timeout (float) – Request timeout

   Returns: List of topic+partitions with offset and possibly error set.

   Return type: list(TopicPartition)

   Raises: KafkaException
   Note: As of MapR 6.0, the message offset in a partition starts from
   zero (0). If you are upgrading and do not enable the MapR Database/MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka feature,
   mfs.feature.db.streams.v6.support, the message offset in a partition
   starts from one (1).
   on_commit(err, partitions)

   A callback for Consumer.commit() that triggers custom actions when a
   commit request completes.
   Parameters(s):
     * err (KafkaError) – Commit error object, or None on success.
     * Partitions (list(TopicPartition)) – List of partitions with their
       committed offsets or per-partition errors

   poll([timeout=None])

   Consume messages, calls callbacks and returns events.

   The application must check the returned Message object’s
   Message.error() method to distinguish between proper messages (error()
   returns None), or an event or error (see error().code() for specifics).

   Parameter(s): timeout (float) – Maximum time to block waiting for
   message, event or callback

   Returns: A Message object or None on timeout

   Return type: Message or None
   position(partitions[, timeout=None])

   Retrieve current positions (offsets) for the list of partitions.

   Parameter(s): partitions (list(TopicPartition)) – List of
   topic+partitions to return current offsets for. The current offset is
   the offset of the last consumed message + 1

   Returns: List of topic+partitions with offset and possibly error set.

   Return type: list(TopicPartition)

   Raises: KafkaException
   This function returns 0 when the messages have not yet been consumed
   from partitions. librdkafka returns -1001 instead.
   subscribe(topics[, listener=None])

   Set subscription to supplied list of topics This replaces a previous
   subscription.
   Parameters:
     * topics (list(str)) – List of topics (strings) to subscribe to.
     * on_assign (callable) – callback to provide handling of customized
       offsets on completion of a successful partition re-assignment.
     * on_revoke (callable) – callback to provide handling of offset
       commits to a customized store on the start of a rebalance
       operation.

   Raises: KafkaException
   Note: You cannot use the rd_kafka_subscribe API to subscribe a consumer
   to topics when that consumer is already assigned to topics. If you call
   this API for an assigned consumer, error RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR__CONFLICT is
   returned.
   on_assign(consumer, partitions) Same as librdkafka.
   unsubscribe() Same as librdkafka.
   on_revoke(consumer, partitions) Parameter(s):
     * consumer (Consumer) – Consumer instance.
     * partitions (list(TopicPartition)) – Absolute list of partitions
       being assigned or revoked.

   get_watermark_offsets(confluent_kafka.TopicPartition) Get
   WatermarkOffsets for a given Topic Partition.

   Parameter(s): TopicPartition - Gets the watermark offset
   Note: This method is applicable as of MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   Python Client MEP 5.0 which is associated with librdkafka 0.11.3.

сlass mapr_streams_python.Producer

   Asynchronous Kafka Producer.
   Method Behavior
   Producer(**kwargs)

   Create new Producer instance using provided configuration dict.
   len() This API returns a positive number to indicate that messages are
   waiting to be produced to a MapR streams topic but the value does not
   indicate the actual number of messages. librdkafka returns the actual
   number of messages that are waiting to be sent to or acknowledged by
   the broker.

   Return type: int
   flush()

   Wait for all messages in the Producer queue to be delivered. This is a
   convenience method that calls poll() until len()is zero.
   poll([timeout])

   Polls the producer for events and calls the corresponding callbacks (if
   registered).
   Parameter(s):
     * timeout (float) – Maximum time to block waiting for events

   Returns: Number of events processed (callbacks served).

   Return type: int
   produce(topic[, value][, key][, partition][, callback])

   Produce message to topic. This is an asynchronous operation, an
   application may use the callback( alias on_delivery) argument to pass a
   function (or lambda) that will be called from poll() when the message
   has been successfully delivered or permanently fails delivery.
   Parameters:
     * topic (str) – Topic to produce message to
     * value (str|bytes) – Message payload
     * key (str|bytes) – Message key
     * partition (int) – Partition to produce to, else uses the configured
       partitioner.
     * on_delivery(err,msg) (func) – Delivery report callback to call
       (from poll() or flush()) on successful or failed deliver

   Raises:
     * BufferError – if the internal producer message queue is full
       (queue.buffering.max.messages exceeded)
     * KafkaException – for other errors, see exception code

   Note: When this function is called with NULL payload, an invalid
   argument error is sent to the callback. librdkafka creates a message
   with NULL payload and key value instead.

class mapr_streams_python.Message

   The Message object represents either a single consumed or produced
   message, or an event . An application must check with error() to see if
   the object is a proper message (error() returns None) or an
   error/event. This class is not user-instantiable.
   Method Behavior
   len()

   Returns: Message value (payload) size in bytes.

   Return type: int
   error()

   The message object is also used to propagate errors and events.
   Applications must check error() to determine if the Message is a proper
   message (error() returns None) or an error or event (error() returns a
   KafkaError object)

   Return type: None or KafkaError
   key()

   Returns: message key or None if not available

   Return type: str|bytes or None
   offset()

   Returns: message offset or None if not available

   Return type: int or None
   partition()

   Returns: partition number or None if not available

   Return type: int or None
   topic()

   Returns: topic name or None if not available

   Return type: str or None
   value()

   Returns: message value (payload) or None if not available

   Return type: str|bytes or None
   timestamp() Returns: message timestamp
   Note: This method is applicable as of MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   Python Client MEP 5.0 which is associated with librdkafka 0.11.3.

class mapr_streams_python.TopicPartition

   TopicPartition is a generic type to hold a single partition and various
   information about it. It is typically used to provide a list of topics
   or partitions for various operations, such as Consumer.assign().
                      Method                               Behavior
