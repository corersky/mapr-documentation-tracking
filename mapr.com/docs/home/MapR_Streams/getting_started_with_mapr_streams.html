Getting Started with MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka

   If you have a basic understanding of MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka's components and the typical flow of messages from producers to
   consumers, you can give MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka a try.
     * Ensure that your Linux, Windows, or OS X system has Java SDK 7 or
       later installed.
     * Install the latest version of MapR on a cluster.
     * Install the MapR core client (mapr-client) package, if you want to
       run the producer and consumer from a machine outside the cluster.
       See [1]Installing the MapR Client for more information.

    1. On a node in the MapR cluster, follow these steps:
         a. Create a stream.
               o Run this command if you plan to run the producer and
                 consumer with the same user ID that you are using to
                 create the stream:
                 maprcli stream create -path /<path to and name of the
                 stream>
               o Run this command if you plan to run the producer and
                 consumer with user IDs that are different from the user
                 ID that you are using to create the stream:
                 maprcli stream create -path /<path to and name of the
                 stream> -consumeperm u:<user ID> -produceperm u:<user ID>
                 The two additional parameters grant security permissions.
                 By default, these permissions are granted to the user ID
                 that ran the maprcli stream create command.

                    -consumeperm
                            Grants permission to read messages from topics
                            that are in the stream.

                    -produceperm
                            Grants permission to publish messages to
                            topics that are in the stream.

         b. Create a topic.
            Run this command to create the topic:
            maprcli stream topic create -path <path and name of the
            stream> -topic <name of the topic>
    2. On the system where the MapR client is installed, compile and
       launch the Java consumer first and then launch the Java producer.
       In both the consumer and producer, change this text to the path and
       name of your stream and to the name of the first of the topics:
       /<path to and name of the stream>:<name of topic>
       For the steps of compiling and launching, see [2]Compiling and
       Running MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Java Apps.
       Launch the consumer first, and then launch the producer. If you
       launch the producer first and then the consumer, the producer
       publishes 50 messages, but the consumer (as consumers do by
       default) starts reading from the head of the partition, which is
       after the 50 messages.
       Note: As of MapR 6.0, the message offset in a partition starts from
       zero (0). If you are upgrading and do not enable the MapR
       Database/MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka feature,
       mfs.feature.db.streams.v6.support, the message offset in a
       partition starts from one (1).

       consumer for this step

       If you launch the consumer first, the partition is empty and the
       consumer continuously polls for new messages.

       After you launch the producer, the fifty messages are published to
       the partition, and the consumer can move forward in the partition,
       reading the messages.
