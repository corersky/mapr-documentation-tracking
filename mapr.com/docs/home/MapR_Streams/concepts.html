Architecture

   MapR-ES streams contain topics which have logical collections of
   messages.

   Topics in MapR-ES are grouped into streams, to which administrators can
   apply security, retention, and replication policies. Combined with
   MapR-FS and MapR-DB in the MapR Converged Data Platform, using these
   streams enables organizations to create a centralized, secure data lake
   that unifies files, database tables, and message topics.

   Messages (topic data) are published to topics by Producer applications
   and are read by Consumer applications. All messages published to
   MapR-ES are persisted, allowing future consumers to “catch-up” on
   processing and analytics applications to process historical data.
   Additionally, messages are specifically written to topic partitions.
   Note: Topic partitions are stored in containers within volumes.
   Containers are written to storage pools, which are made up of disks on
   the nodes in the cluster. See [1]Containers and the CLDB for more
   information about containers.

Why Use MapR-ES?

   MapR-ES is ideal for a variety of use cases, including the following:

   Application event pipelines
          Many types of applications generate event or log data that must
          be centrally stored and analyzed to gain insights about user
          activity or application performance. MapR-ES simplifies these
          pipelines by transporting events to a central location, from
          which they can undergo event-by-event transformation and
          analysis.

   Database change capture
          Most modern databases enable users to generate an event each
          time an entry is added or modified. These events can be
          published to MapR-ES to keep systems like search indexes and
          caches synchronized, as well as to feed security or notification
          applications.

   Internet of Things
          The explosion in the number of smart devices and sensors has
          created many situations in which billions of data points are
          created by millions of geographically dispersed sensors. MapR-ES
          provides a reliable, global transport for these messages,
          enabling you to perform analytics both at the source and at a
          central location.

Replication

   In addition to reliably delivering messages to applications within a
   single data center, MapR-ES can continuously replicate data between
   multiple clusters, delivering messages globally. Like other MapR
   services, MapR-ES has a distributed, scale-out design, allowing it to
   scale to billions of messages per second, millions of topics, and
   millions of producer and consumer applications.

Server and Client Libraries

   client libraries

   Server
          The server manages streams, topics, and partitions and handles
          requests from the producer client library and the consumer
          client library.

   Producer client library
          This client side library which is part of the producer process
          receives the messages that are sent by producers, buffers the
          messages, and sends them to the server, which then publishes the
          messages and sends the client acknowledgements.

   Consumer client library
          This client side library which is part of the consumer process
          receives requests from consumers to poll subscriptions for
          unread messages, reads messages from topic partitions, and sends
          messages to consumers.
