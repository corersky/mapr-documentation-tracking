Producers

   Producers are data-generating applications, such as sensors in
   automobiles or activity loggers in servers. Producers create messages
   with the collected data and publishes the messages to MapR Event Store
   For Apache Kafka topics, specifically, to MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka topic-partitions.

Permissions

   Before a producer can publish to topics, the user ID running the
   producer needs these permissions:
     * The writeAce permission on the volume where the streams are
       located. For information about how to set permissions on volumes,
       see [1]Setting Whole Volume ACEs.
     * The produceperm permission on the streams where the topics are
       located. Users with the adminperm permission on those streams can
       grant the produceperm permission.

Producing Messages

   Producers create messages about the collected data and send the
   collected data to a MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka producer client
   library. In addition to the actual message, the producer specifies the
   topic that the message is intended for and an optional partition ID.
   The producer client buffers incoming messages and sends them (in
   batches) to the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server.
   Note: In case of server failure, the producer client automatically
   continues to retry sending messages.
   Attention: As of MapR 6.1, the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka API
   enforces a maximum of 4096 partitions for a topic. That is, when you
   create an application with the API, the maximum number of partitions is
   4096. If you previously created an application with MapR Event Store
   For Apache Kafka 6.0.1 API (or older) and you've upgraded, the original
   number of partitions can be used. For example, if you were using more
   than 4096 partitions in MapR 6.0.1 or earlier, you will be able to
   continue with the same number of partitions after upgrading.

Event-time Timestamp

   As of MapR 6.0.1, MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka supports an
   event-time timestamp. The timestamp type can be either createtime
   (default) or logappendtime. See the maprcli [2]stream create and
   [3]stream edit for more information about these parameters.
   Tip: Because each message is automatically published into a
   topic-partition with an event-time timestamp as part of the message
   record, this allows the Consumer application to seek records based on
   the timestamp.

Idempotent (exactly once) Producers

   An "exactly-once" message delivery semantic produces messages without
   duplication. Each message is delivered once and only once. Exactly-once
   is insured by uniquely identifying a group of messages that are
   atomically persisted. Exactly-once message delivery is set with the
   producer idempotence option. See [4]Modes of Publishing for more
   information.
   The following failure scenarios are addressed with idempotence:
     * The stream processor might take input from multiple source topics
       and the ordering across these source topics is not deterministic
       across multiple runs. So if you re-run your stream processor that
       takes input from multiple source topics, it might produce different
       results.
     * The stream processor might produce output to multiple destination
       topics. If the producer cannot do an atomic write across multiple
       topics, then the producer output can be incorrect if writes to some
       (but not all) partitions fail.
     * The stream processor might aggregate or join data across multiple
       inputs. If one of the instances of the stream processor fails, then
       you need to be able to rollback the state materialized by that
       instance of the stream processor. On restarting the instance, you
       also need to be able to resume processing and recreate its state.
     * The stream processor might look up enriching information in an
       external database or by calling out to a service that is updated
       out of band. By depending on an external service, the stream
       processor can be fundamentally non-deterministic. For example, if
       the external service changes its internal state between two runs of
       the stream processor, it can lead to incorrect results downstream.
