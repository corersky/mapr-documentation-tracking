Producers

   Producers create messages with collected data and publishes the
   messages to MapR-ES topics, specifically, to MapR-ES topic-partitions.
   Producers are data-generating applications, such as sensors in
   automobiles or activity loggers in servers.

Permissions

   Before a producer can publish to topics, the user ID running the
   producer needs these permissions:
     * The writeAce permission on the volume where the streams are
       located. For information about how to set permissions on volumes,
       see [1]Setting Whole Volume ACEs.
     * The produceperm permission on the streams where the topics are
       located. Users with the adminperm permission on those streams can
       grant the produceperm permission.

Producing Messages

   Producers create messages about the collected data and send the
   collected data to a MapR-ES producer client library. This client
   buffers incoming messages and then sends them in batches to the MapR-ES
   server, which publishes the messages into topic-partitions that the
   producers have specified.

   They create messages and send them to a MapR-ES producer client
   library. This client buffers incoming messages and then sends them in
   batches to the MapR-ES server. The server publishes the messages to the
   topics that producers have specified. In case of server failure, the
   producer client continually retries automatically to send messages.

   To send a message to the MapR-ES server, the producer creates a record,
   which specifies the topic the message is intended for, an optional
   partition ID, and the actual message.

Event-time Timestamp

   As of MapR 6.0.1, MapR-ES supports an event-time timestamp. The
   timestamp type can be either createtime (default) or logappendtime. See
   the maprcli [2]stream create and [3]stream edit for more information
   about these parameters.
   Tip: Because each message is automatically published into a
   topic-partition with an event-time timestamp as part of the message
   record, this allows the Consumer application to seek records based on
   the timestamp.
