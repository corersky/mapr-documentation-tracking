Monitoring Streams

   The speed at which messages flow from producers to partitions and from
   partitions to consumers depends on the performance of your producers,
   the cluster nodes hosting partitions, and your consumers.

   You can monitor streams in the MapR Control System and using the CLI.

Monitoring Streams Operations Using the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Metrics tab in the [1]node information page
   to select the charts that show the following when you filter the list
   of charts by table activities:
     * All Streams Producer Messages: The number of Streams messages
       produced on the node
     * All Streams Consumer Messages: The number of Streams messages on
       the node read by consumers
     * All Streams Producer Ops: The number of Streams producer RPCs on
       the node
     * All Streams Consumer Ops: The number of Streams consumer RPCs on
       the node

   For more information, see [2]Adding and Removing Charts from the Charts
   View.
