Configuring Properties for Message Size

   Describes the message.max.bytes and receive.message.max.bytes
   properties for configuring message size.

   message.max.bytes
          For a C producer, the message.max.bytes value is 1000000 B by
          default.

          The minimum value is 1000 B and maximum value is 32000000 B. The
          maximum message size produced by a C API is decided by the
          message.max.bytes value set on the C producer.

          From C, Python, and C# APIs, the maximum message size that can
          be produced is 32000000 B. If a C consumer needs to consume a
          message that is greater than 32000000 B in size, which may be
          produced by a Java client, the consumer needs to update the
          message.max.bytes or receive.message.max.bytes properties to a
          higher value to consume it.

          If the message.max.bytes property is set to greater than
          32000000 B, it is by default capped at 32000000 B. Though a
          consumer can consume messages greater than 32000000 B (produced
          say by a Java client), only up to 32000000 B is produced from
          the MapR C client. The maximum message size consumed by a C API
          is limited by the value that is higher among the
          message.max.bytes and receive.message.max.bytes values.

   receive.message.max.bytes
          For a C consumer, the receive.message.max.bytes is 1000000 B by
          default. The minimum value is 1000 B and maximum value is
          1000000000 B.

   Using a Java API, a larger message size can be produced if the
   cluster-side property is changed using the following maprcli config
   save command:
Cluster side:

maprcli config save -values
{"mfs.db.max.rowsize.kb":<value in KB>}

   In this case, the row size is 32 MB by default and the maximum is a
   little less than 2 GB.

   The mfs.db.max.rowsize.kb setting is a cluster-wide setting that
   applies to MapR Database (Binary+JSON) and MapR Event Store for Apache
   Kafka, and it is not configurable per stream or topic.
