MapR-ES Python Applications

   As of MapR 5.2.1, you can create python applications for MapR-ES using
   the MapR-ES Python client. The MapR-ES Python client is a binding for
   librdkafka and the MapR-ES C Client is a distribution of librdkafka
   that works with MapR-ES.

   The MapR-ES Python client is available in a MapR Expansion Pack (MEP)
   starting with MEP 3.0.
   The following Apache Kafka librdkafka versions are supported:

   CAPTION: Table 1. Supported Apache Kafka librdkafka versions

            MapR release          MEP Release Kafka librdkafka version
   As of MapR 6.0.1               As of 5.0   0.11.3
   As of MapR 5.2.1 through 6.0.0 As of 3.0   0.9.0
   Note: Because the MapR-ES Python Client is dependent on the MapR-ES C
   Client, the MapR-ES C Client must be configured before using the
   MapR-ES Python Client.
   When developing and running MapR-ES Python applications, note the
   following points:
     * You can create producers and high-level consumers. Low-level
       consumers are not supported.
     * Consuming or producing topics in a Kafka cluster is not supported.
     * MapR-ES offset values start at 1, not 0.
     * MapR security is supported including ACLs and ACEs for
       authorization. The unique Kafka security features that are part of
       Apache Kafka are not supported. See [1]Security for more
       information about MapR security features.
     * User impersonation is not supported.
