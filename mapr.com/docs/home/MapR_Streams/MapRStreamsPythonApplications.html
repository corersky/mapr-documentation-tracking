MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Applications

   As of MapR 5.2.1, you can create python applications for MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka using the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   Python client. The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python client is a
   binding for librdkafka and the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C
   Client is a distribution of librdkafka that works with MapR Event Store
   For Apache Kafka.

   The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python client is available in a
   MapR Ecosystem Pack (MEP) starting with MEP 3.0.
   The following Apache Kafka librdkafka versions are supported:

   Note: Because the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client is
   dependent on the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client, the MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client must be configured before using
   the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client.
   When developing and running MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python
   applications, note the following points:
     * You can create producers and high-level consumers. Low-level
       consumers are not supported.
     * Consuming or producing topics in a Kafka cluster is not supported.
     * MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka offset values start at 1, not 0.
     * MapR security is supported including ACLs and ACEs for
       authorization. The unique Kafka security features that are part of
       Apache Kafka are not supported. See [1]Security for more
       information about MapR security features.
     * User impersonation is not supported.
