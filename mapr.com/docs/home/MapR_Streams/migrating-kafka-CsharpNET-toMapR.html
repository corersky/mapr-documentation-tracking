Migrating Kafka C#/.NET Applications to MapR-ES

   With some modification, you can use existing confluent-kafka C#/.NET
   applications to consume and produce topics in MapR-ES. The MapR-ES
   C#/.NET Client is a binding for Apache librdkafka that works with
   MapR-ES.

Migrating a .NET 4.5 or 4.6 Application

   Note: This migration information is applicable for Windows (Win7-x64)
   platform only.

   To migrate an existing .NET 4.5 or 4.6 application:
    1. Install and configure the MapR-ES C Client. See [1]Configuring the
       MapR-ES C Client.
    2. Replace the librdkafka.dll with the MapR librdkafka 0.11.3 from
       /bin/.../runtimes/<win7-x64>/<native folder>.
    3. Add a symlink from the MapRClient.dll to the librdkafka.dll.
    4. Restart the application.

Migrating a .NET Core Application1

   Note: This migration information is applicable for Windows (Win7-x64)
   and Linux platforms.

   To migrate an existing .NET Core application:
    1. Install and configure the MapR-ES C Client. See [2]Configuring the
       MapR-ES C Client.
    2. Replace the librdkafka.dll with the MapR librdkafka 0.11.3 from
       USER_HOME/.NUGET/PACKAGES/LIBRDKAFKA.REDIST/0.11.3/runtimes/<platfo
       rm>/<native folder>.
    3. Add a symlink from the MapRClient.dll to the librdkafka.dll.
    4. Restart the application.

Migrating a .NET Core Application2

   Note: This migration information is applicable for Linux platforms
   only.

   To migrate an existing .NET Core application:
    1. Remove all .so files from the
       ~/.NUGET/PACKAGES/LIBRDKAFKA.REDIST/0.11.3/runtimes/<platform>/<nat
       ive folder> directory.
    2. Install and configure the MapR-ES C Client. See [3]Configuring the
       MapR-ES C Client.
    3. Replace the librdkafka.dll with the MapR librdkafka 0.11.3 from
       USER_HOME/.NUGET/PACKAGES/LIBRDKAFKA.REDIST/0.11.3/runtimes/
       directory.
    4. If the MapR Client doesn not install into the ID search path, add a
       symlink from the MapRClient.dll to the l/usr/local/lib.
    5. Restart the application.

General Migration Information

     * When you refer to a topic in the application code, include the path
       and name of the stream in which the topic is located:
/<path and name of stream>:<name of topic>
       For example, you might have a stream in a MapR cluster that is
       named stream_A, and the stream might be in a volume named IoT and
       in a directory named automobile_sensors. You want to redirect a
       producer application to a topic in that stream. The syntax of the
       path to the topic might look like this:
       /mapr/IoT/automobile_sensors/stream_A:<name of topic>.
       Note: Optionally, use the streams.consumer.default.stream and
       streams.producer.default.stream configuration parameters. When you
       configure these parameters, applications can specify just the topic
       name to write or read from the default stream.
     * Review the APIs that are supported and make changes to your
       application, as needed. See [4]API for MapR-ES C#/.NET.
     * See [5]Configuration Properties for MapR-ES C#/.NET Client for the
       list of supported configuration parameters and make changes to your
       application, as needed.
       Note: SSL-related configuration parameters are ignored. When you
       set these parameters, the MapR-ES Client issues a warning
       indicating that the parameters are not supported.
