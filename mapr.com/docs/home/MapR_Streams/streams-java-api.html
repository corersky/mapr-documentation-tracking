MapR-ES Java API Library

   Use the MapR-ES Admin Java API library as an alternative to maprcli
   commands and the REST APIs for performing administrative tasks on
   streams and topics. This library can also be used for analysis of the
   contents of streams.

Java Interfaces, Classes, and Enums

   The MapR-ES Java API library consists of the following interfaces and
   class:

   [5]Admin
          Provides methods for performing administrative tasks on streams
          and topics, as well as for obtaining StreamDescriptor and
          TopicDescriptor objects.

   [6]StreamDescriptor
          Provides methods for setting and retrieving values for stream
          attributes. StreamDescriptor is passed into methods when
          performing operations on streams, for example, creating a new
          stream and editing an existing stream. StreamDescriptor is also
          used to find attribute values for an existing stream.

   [7]TopicDescriptor
          Note: TopicDescriptor is new as of 6.0.1.
          Provides methods for setting and retrieving topic values.
          TopicDescriptor is passed into methods when performing
          operations on topics, for example, setting and retrieving topic
          partitions and timestamp type. The available timestamp type can
          be either createtime or logappendtime.

          When a producer writes a message to a MapR-ES topic, a timestamp
          is included that is part of the message record. This timestamp
          can be used to implement time-based indexing. Time-based
          indexing enables consumers to find the offsets for messages
          based on timestamps. The returned message offset corresponds to
          the earliest topic-partition message whose timestamp is equal to
          or greater than the provided timestamp.

          Note: APIs that support timeout semantics will adhere to the
          specified timeouts only if the client is configured for soft
          mount.

   [8]Streams Class
          Streams class is also required to create an instance of Admin,
          which is used for all admin operations on streams. It can also
          be used to create a StreamDescriptor or TopicDescriptor objects.

          Provides the entry point to accessing MapR-ES streams for
          analytics purposes.

   [9]TimestampType Enum
          Note: TopicDescriptor is new as of 6.0.1.
          Provides the timestamp type of the records.

   TopicRefreshListListener / TopicRefreshRegexListener
          Note: Internal; not for public usage.

MapR-ES Java APIs (as of 6.0.1)

   The following table lists the new Interfaces and APIs for MapR 6.0.1.
   They are the delta between MapR 6.0.1 and 6.0.0, meaning, they are
   applicable to MapR 6.0.1 but not MapR 6.0.0.

   CAPTION: Table 2. MapR-ES APIs (as of 6.0.1)

   Interface and Methods Description
   Admin.close Long duration for TimeUnit.
   Admin.createTopic TopicDescriptor array for topic attributes.
   Admin.editTopic TopicDescriptor array for topic attributes.
   Admin.getTopicDescriptor Method for retrieving topic attributes.
   Admin.listTopic Method for listing all the topics in a stream.
   Admin.streamExists Method for determining whether a stream exists.
   StreamDescriptor.getDefaultTimestampType Method for retrieving the
   timestamp type.
   StreamDescriptor.setDefaultTimestampType Method for setting the
   timestamp type.
   TopicDescriptor New MapR interface.
   TopicDescriptor.getPartitions Method associated with the new interface.
   TopicDescriptor.setPartitions Method associated with the new interface.
   TopicDescriptor.getTimestampType Method associated with the new
   interface.
   TopicDescriptor.setTimestampType Method associated with the new
   interface.
   Enum TimestampType New Enum class and associated methods.

Backward Compatibility

   As of MapR 6.0.1, Apache Kafka 1.0 is supported. The following pause,
   resume, seekToBeginning, and seekToEnd APIs support the Collection
   Interface. The deprecated APIs will continue to run unchanged, however,
   they may be removed in a future release.

   CAPTION: Table 3. Deprecated MapR APIs (as of 6.0.1)

   Replacement Collection APIs Deprecated APIs
   void pause(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions); void
   pause(TopicPartition... partitions);
   void resume(Collection<TopicPartition>partitions); void
   resume(TopicPartition... partitions);
   void seekToBeginning(Collection<TopicPartition>); void
   seekToBeginning(TopicPartition... partitions);
   void seekToEnd(Collection<TopicPartition>); void
   seekToEnd(TopicPartition... partitions);
   The following subscribe and assign APIs support the Collection
   Interface (which is more generalized) as well as the List Interface.
   Support for the List Interface has been retained for backward binary
   compatibility.

   CAPTION: Table 4. Retained MapR APIs (as of 6.0.1)

   Replacement Collection APIs Retained APIs
   void subscribe(Collection<String> topics); void
   subscribe(java.util.List<java.lang.String> topics);
   void subscribe(Collection<String> topics, ConsumerRebalanceListener);
   void subscribe(java.util.List<java.lang.String> topics,
   ConsumerRebalanceListener listener);
   void assign(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions); void
   assign(java.util.List<TopicPartition> partitions);
