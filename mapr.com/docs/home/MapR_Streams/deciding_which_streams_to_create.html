Stream Design

   Streams are created in volumes and contain topics which, in turn,
   contain messages. Security, replication, retention, and compression
   policies are applied at the stream-level.
   When designing the architecture, take in account the following factors:
     * Security Permissions (using access-control expressions)
       Security permissions are set at the stream-level and, subsequently,
       topics inherit the stream permissions. See [1]Stream Security for
       more information.
     * Data Replication
       MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka streams can be replicated to
       other streams in the same or different MapR clusters. For example,
       you can create a backup copy of a stream so that producers and
       consumers fail over to the backup if the original stream goes
       offline. See [2]Stream Replication
     * Data Retention
       The time-to-live of a message is the elapse time (in seconds)
       between the publication of a message in a topic in this stream and
       the expiration of that message. See [3]Time-to-Live for Messages
       for more information.
     * Data Compression
       Topic messages can be sent to the server compressed. When
       compression is implemented, the messages are stored compressed,
       replicated to other containers compressed, and (if stream
       replication is configured) replicated to replica streams
       compressed. See [4]Managing Compression for more information.

Pollution Monitor Example

   Suppose that you plan to create the stream pollution_monitors to
   collect various measurements about pollution levels in European cities.
   However, during a planning session, the representative from Amsterdam
   says that her country wants to analyze of the data for its cities and
   would like your company to replicate the data to its own MapR cluster,
   where its own consumers can read the replicated messages.
   In this scenario, you might do the following:
     * Create a stream dedicated to the Netherland's pollution data or
       even for every country you are monitoring. For example, create
       streams named pollution_monitors_netherlands,
       pollution_monitors_sweden, pollution_monitors_france, and so on.
     * Within each stream, create topics for each city in that county. For
       example, a create topic named amsterdam which contains data from
       Amsterdam's pollution sensors.
     * Since, in this scenario, the Amsterdam representive also requested
       stream replication to their own MapR cluster, you would set up
       stream replication from your MapR cluster to Amsterdam's MapR
       cluster. See [5]Managing Stream Replication for information about
       setting up and managing replication.

   Alternatively, perhaps the Netherlands didn't request replication to
   their own MapR cluster, however, you want to restrict access to the
   pollution data where consumers could read only pollution data for their
   respective country.
   In this scenario, you might do the following:
     * Create streams for each country.
     * Create topics for each city in that country.
     * Set each stream's consumeperm permission for consumers associated
       with that country. See [6]Stream Security for more information
       about security permissions used with MapR Event Store For Apache
       Kafka streams. For general information about access-control
       expressions, see [7]ACE Syntax.
