Migrating Kafka Python Applications to MapR-ES

   With some modification, you can use existing confluent-kafka python
   applications to consume and produce topics in MapR-ES. The MapR-ES
   Python Client is a binding for Apache librdkafka that works with
   MapR-ES.
    1. Install the MapR-ES Python Client.
       Note: This required that you also install and configure the MapR-ES
       C Client. See [1]Configuring the MapR-ES C Client.
    2. Do one of the following depending on whether you are using the MEP
       5.0 (or higher) MapR-ES Python Client or the MEP 3.0 (or higher)
       MapR-ES Python Client.
          + If you are using MapR-ES Python MEP 5.0 (or higher), skip this
            step. The references to confluent_kafka should be retained.
          + If you are using MapR-ES Python MEP 3.0 (or higher), update
            import statements to refer to the MapR Stream Python API.
            References to confluent_kafka should be updated to
            mapr_streams_python.
            Note: For example, update from confluent_kafka import Consumer
            to from mapr_streams_python import Consumer.
    3. When you refer to a topic in the application code, include the path
       and name of the stream in which the topic is located:
/<path and name of stream>:<name of topic>
       For example, you might have a stream in a MapR cluster that is
       named stream_A, and the stream might be in a volume named IoT and
       in a directory named automobile_sensors. You want to redirect a
       producer application to a topic in that stream. The syntax of the
       path to the topic might look like this:
       /mapr/IoT/automobile_sensors/stream_A:<name of topic>.
       Note: Optionally, use the streams.consumer.default.stream and
       streams.producer.default.stream configuration parameters. When you
       configure these parameters, applications can specify just the topic
       name to write or read from the default stream.
    4. Review the APIs that are supported and make changes to your
       application, as needed. See [2]API for MapR-ES Python Client.
    5. See [3]Configuration Properties for MapR-ES Python Client for the
       list of supported configuration parameters and make changes to your
       application, as needed.
       Note: SSL-related configuration parameters are ignored. When you
       set these parameters, the MapR-ES Client issues a warning
       indicating that the parameters are not supported.
