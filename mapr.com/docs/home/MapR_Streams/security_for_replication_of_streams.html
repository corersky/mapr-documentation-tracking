Security for Stream Replication

   Describes where security can be implemented for stream replication.

   On clusters
          You can replicate between streams that are in secure clusters.

   At source streams
          The -adminperm parameter in the commands maprcli stream create
          and maprcli stream edit lets you specify an access-control
          expression (ACE) to declare who has administrative permissions
          on a stream, including permission to replicate the stream. The
          ACEs themselves are copied the first time during auto setup but
          are not replicated continuously. You need to manage the
          replicated and source ACEs separately after the initial setup.

   Across a network
          You can send data encrypted or unencrypted when replicating
          streams by using the -networkencryption parameter when you
          create or edit a replica.

   At gateways
          Gateways ensure that replicas receive data only from approved
          source streams.
