Security for Stream Replication

   Describes where security can be implemented for stream replication.

   On clusters
          You can replicate between streams that are in secure clusters.

   At source streams
          The -adminperm parameter in the commands maprcli stream create
          and maprcli stream edit lets you specify an access-control
          expression to declare who has administrative permissions on a
          stream, including permission to replicate the stream.

   Across a network
          You can send data encrypted or unencrypted when replicating
          streams by using the -networkencryption parameter when you
          create or edit a replica.

   At gateways
          Gateways ensure that replicas receive data only from approved
          source streams.
