Mirroring Topics with Apache Kafka's MirrorMaker

   Use Apache Kafka's MirrorMaker utility either to mirror topics that are
   in Apache Kafka clusters to streams that are in MapR clusters or to
   Mirror topics that are in MapR clusters to Apache Kafka clusters.
   Mirroring is a type of replication that takes place in this sequence of
   steps:
    1. Messages that are published to topics in a source cluster are read
       by consumers that MirrorMaker manages.
    2. These consumers send the messages to producers that MirrorMaker
       also manages.
    3. The producers publish the messages in topics that are in the
       destination cluster.

   Mirroring can continue indefinitely. Alternatively, you can mirror your
   data as a way of migrating it from Apache Kafka to MapR-ES. If you use
   it for this purpose, you can stop mirroring after migrating your
   producers and consumers to use MapR-ES, as described in [1]Migrating
   Apache Kafka 0.9.0 Applications to MapR-ES.
   Attention: MirrorMaker does not provide the same reliability guarantees
   as the replication features in MapR-ES. In particular, MirrorMaker does
   not replicate cursors or message positions, which makes disaster
   recovery much more difficult than with replication of MapR-ES.
   Therefore, MapR recommends MirrorMaker for use only for mirroring
   between MapR-ES and Apache Kafka, not for replication of MapR-ES.

Prerequisites

     * Ensure that the destination stream in the MapR cluster exists. To
       create a stream, run the command [2]maprcli stream create.
     * Ensure that the ID of the user that runs MirrorMaker has the
       produceperm and topicperm permissions on the stream.

Command Syntax and Descriptions of Parameters

bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.MirrorMaker
--consumer.config <File that lists consumer properties and values>
--num.streams <Number of consumer threads>
--producer.config <File that lists producer properties and values>
[--whitelist=<Java-style regular expression for specifying the topics to mirror>
]
[--blacklist=<Java-style regular expression for specifying the topics not to mir
ror>]

   Parameter Description
   consumer.config The path and name of the file that lists the consumer
   properties. See the [3]Consumer Properties and Descriptions section for
   detailed information.
   num.streams Use the --num.streams option to specify the number of
   mirror consumer threads to create. Note that if you start multiple
   mirror maker processes then you may want to look at the distribution of
   partitions on the source cluster. If the number of consumption streams
   is too high per mirror maker process, then some of the mirroring
   threads will be idle by virtue of the consumer rebalancing algorithm
   (if they do not end up owning any partitions for consumption).
   producer.config The path and name of the file that lists the producer
   properties. See the [4]Producer Properties and Descriptions section for
   detailed information.
   whitelist A Java-style regular expression for specifying the topics to
   copy. Commas (',') are interpreted as the regex-choice symbol ('|').

   If you use this parameter, do not use the blacklist parameter.
   blacklist A Java-style regular expression for specifying the topics not
   to copy. Commas (',') are interpreted as the regex-choice symbol ('|').

   If you use this parameter, do not use the whitelist parameter.

Consumer Properties and Descriptions

zookeeper.connect=<IP address>:<ZooKeeper port>
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=<Timeout value in milliseconds>
group.id=<ID>
bootstrap.servers=<IP address>:<port>
shallow.iterator.enable=false

   Property Description
   zookeeper.connect The IP address and port number of the ZooKeeper
   instance for the Apache Kafka cluster.
   zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms The max time that the client waits to
   establish a connection to zookeeper. If not set, the value in
   zookeeper.session.timeout.ms is used.
   group.id A unique string that identifies the consumer group this
   consumer belongs to. This property is required if the consumer uses
   either the group management functionality by using subscribe(topic) or
   the Kafka-based offset management strategy.

   If group.id is not set and the value of the num.streams option is > 1 ,
   messages might go multiple times to a stream.
   bootstrap.servers A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the
   initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of
   all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for
   bootstrappingâ€”this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover
   the full set of servers. This list should be in the form
   host1:port1,host2:port2,.... Since these servers are just used for the
   initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may
   change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers
   (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).
   shallow.iterator.enable Set this value to false.

Producer Properties and Descriptions

key.serializer=<serializer class>
value.serializer=<serializer class>
streams.producer.default.stream=<Path and name of the stream to copy the topics
to>
auto.create.topics.enable=true

   Property Description
   key.serializer The name of the appropriate serialization class in the
   [5]org.apache.kafka.common.serialization package or a class that
   implements the [6]Serializer interface for serializing keys.
   value.serializer The class that implements the [7]Serializer interface
   for serializing values.
   streams.producer.default.stream Specifies the path and name of stream
   that the topics will be copied to.
   auto.create.topics.enable Enables auto-creation of topics within the
   stream specifed with the streams.producer.default.stream parameter.
