Consuming Messages

   This is the process by which consumers consume messages.

   Consumers request the MapR-ES consumer client library to check whether
   any new messages have been published in the topics or partitions they
   are subscribed to or the partitions that they are assigned. Consumers
   can do this at any time.

   If a minimum number of bytes worth of messages is waiting across a
   consumer's subscription, MapR-ES sends those messages to the consumer,
   up to a maximum number of bytes. You can configure this minimum and
   maximum in the configuration parameters for each consumer.

   The MapR-ES consumer client library sends the consumer messages that
   have been published by producers but not yet flushed to disk. If a
   consumer is able to consume data at the rate at which a producer
   publishes messages, the consumer client library library continuously
   sends messages to consumers from its memory, increasing the speed of
   throughput from producer to consumer.

Time-based Consumption

   As of MapR 6.0.1, MapR-ES supports the consumption of messages based on
   the message's timestamp. When a consumer wants to search for messages
   based on a timestamp, the consumer provides the topic-partition and the
   timestamp, and then, MapR-ES locates the message and returns the offset
   for that message. The returned message offset corresponds to the
   earliest message in a topic-partition whose timestamp is equal to or
   greater than (>=) the consumer-provided timestamp.

   For example, with the following topic-partition, if your
   consumer-provided timestamp is 1522195205, then offset 1 would be
   returned because it is the earliest message with a timestamp that is
   greater than or equal to the consumer-provided timestamp. In this case,
   greater than (>).
topic:partition0
        offset 0: 1522195200
        offset 1: 1522195210
        offset 2: 1522195205
        offset 3: 1522195215

   Tip: By the way, the consumer-provided timestamp and the returned
   message offset is in seconds since a Epoch Unix Time Stamp is used. In
   this example, the consumer-provided timestamp is March 26th, 2018 @
   12:00:05am and the message offsets are timestamped March 28th @
   12:00:00, 12:00:010, 12:00:05, and 12:00:15 in that order.
