Monitoring Consumers

   There are two commands that you can run at intervals to get a sense of
   how far behind a consumer is in a partition. The consumer must belong
   to a consumer group, even if the consumer is the only member of that
   group.

   To find the lag in milliseconds between the timestamp of the most
   recently published message in a stream, topic, or partition and the
   timestamp of a consumer's most recently committed cursor, run the
   command [1]stream cursor list. The lag is the value of the
   consumerlagmillis parameter.
   To find the timestamp of the most recently committed cursor for the
   consumer that is furthest back in a partition compared to all other
   consumers reading from the same partition, run the command [2]stream
   topic info. This timestamp is the value of the
   mintimestampacrossconsumers parameter. Use this timestamp together with
   the values of the following parameters to get a sense of where this
   cursor is in the partition:

   mintimestamp
          This parameter shows the timestamp of the oldest message in the
          partition.

   maxtimestamp
          This parameter shows the timestamp of the most recently
          published message in the partition.

   If a consumer's configuration for cursor commits is the default (the
   configuration parameter enable.auto.commit is set to true and
   auto.commit.interval.ms is set to 1000 milliseconds), the consumer will
   be only about one second ahead of the offset and timestamp reported for
   the consumer's most recently committed cursor.

   If it seems that consumers are falling behind and that this problem is
   not caused by server-side I/O bottlenecks, you can start more consumer
   threads.

   If the current number of consumers in a consumer group is equal to the
   number of partitions in the topic with the fewest partitions to which
   the consumer group is subscribed, add a partition to this topic before
   adding a consumer. The consumer client library dynamically reassigns
   the existing partitions in the topic to the consumers in the consumer
   group, as well as assigning the new partition to a consumer.

   If the current number of consumers in a consumer group is less than the
   number of partitions in the topic with the fewest partitions to which
   the consumer group is subscribed, you don't need to add any partitions
   before adding a consumer.
