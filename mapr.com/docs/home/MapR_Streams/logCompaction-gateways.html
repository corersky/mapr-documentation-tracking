Preparing Clusters for Log Compaction

   Describes how to prepare your environment so you can use log
   compaction.

Installing with the MapR Installer

   When you use the MapR Installer to install MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka, a local gateway is also locally installed so that log compaction
   can be implemented. To configure for log compaction, see maprcli
   [1]stream create and [2]stream edit.

Installing without the MapR Installer

   Other sections of the documentation describe the detailed steps for
   installing and configuring without the MapR installer. Generally, you
   need to perform the following steps:
    1. Install the MapR software.To install MapR without using the MapR
       installer, follow the steps outlined at [3]Installing without the
       MapR Installer.
    2. Install the MapR gateway on your local cluster. Since gateways for
       log compaction are installed on the local cluster, no configuration
       is needed. See [4]Gateways and Stream Replication for general
       information about gateways.

Adding Gateways for Load Balancing

   Since the number of gateways impacts the compaction process, you might
   want to increase the number of gateways on the cluster to improve the
   load distribution. To add gateways for log compaction, you install
   additional MapR gateways on your local cluster. See [5]Gateways and
   Stream Replication for general information about gateways.
   Note: No configuration is required because the additional gateways are
   installed on the local clusster.
