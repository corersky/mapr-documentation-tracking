MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Java Applications

   This section contains information on developing client applications
   with Java including information about the MapR Event Store For Apache
   Kafka and Apache Kafka Java APIs, configuration parameters, and
   compiling and running producers and consumers.

Apache Kafka Support

   The following Apache Kafka Java API versions are supported:

   CAPTION: Table 1. Supported Apache Kafka APIs

     MapR version    Apache Kafka API
   As of 6.1         1.1
   As of 6.0.1       1.0
   6.0.0 and earlier 0.9.0

Log Compaction

   As of MapR 6.1, log compaction is supported. Log compaction can be
   enabled for streams created with MapR core 6.1 and later. In addition,
   clients older than MapR 6.1 are prevented from consuming from streams
   that have had log compaction enabled on them at least once in their
   lifetime.
   When a stream on a source cluster has both log compaction and
   replication enabled, the replica cluster does not automatically have
   log compaction enabled. You must explicitly enable log compaction on
   the replica cluster.
     * If a replica cluster has been upgraded and the stream data for a
       source cluster is compacted (that is, one or more messages have
       been deleted), then the source cluster replicates the compacted
       data to the replica cluster.
     * If a replica cluster has not been upgraded, then the source cluster
       fails the replication and an error is generated that requests an
       replica cluster upgrade.

   In the context of a scan by an non-upgraded client, the (upgraded)
   server inspects the row header to check if it is serving a compacted
   row. If it is, then it will fail the consumer request. This behavior
   applies both to a stream that is explicitly configured for compaction
   and a replica that has received a compacted row.
   Important: To perform log compaction on older streams, the -force
   option can be used. The -force option should only be used when ALL
   clients have been upgraded to MapR 6.1.

Idempotent Producer

   As of MapR 6.1, the idempotent producer (exactly once) feature is
   supported. The idempotent producer can be implemented with MapR core
   6.1 and later.
   When creating a producer instance, use the following configuration:
props.put(ProducerConfig.ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCE_CONFIG, true)

   The idempotent producer feature is supported by MEP 6.0 clients and
   v6.1.0 servers.
     * All servers must be upgraded to v6.1.0 with the v6.1.0 features are
       enabled before the idempotent producer can be enabled.
     * If you are using a pre-MapR 6.1 Client and a MapR 6.1 Server and if
       a group of messages are atomically persisted without a valid
       producer id, the server treats the request as a non-idempotent
       producer.
     * If a MapR 6.1 client and a pre-MapR 6.1 server are used, the
       idempotent producer is not supported. In this case, the idempotent
       producer fails to produce to the stream and the following excepton
       is thrown:
Exception in thread "main" java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.k
afka.common.errors.UnknownTopicOrPartitionException: Operation not permitted (1)

java:75)
Caused by: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnknownTopicOrPartitionException: Oper

TimestampType Permissions

   The following describes the ACE permissions are needed when using the
   timestamp type parameter. See [1]Stream Security for general
   information about MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka streams security.

   A MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka stream topic inherits the default
   timestamp type value from its stream. To override the stream's default
   value, set the timestamp type for the topic to a different value.
     * Setting the value at the stream-level requires adminperm
       permissions. The stream-level timestamp type parameter is
       defaulttimestamptype. See [2]stream create and [3]stream edit for
       more information on setting this parameter through the maprcli.
     * Setting the timestamptype at the topic-level requires topicperm
       permissions. The topic-level timestamp type parameter is
       timestamptype. See [4]stream topic create and [5]stream topic edit
       for more information on setting this parameter through the maprcli.

User Impersonation

   Note: As of MapR 6.0, user impersonation is supported for MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka.

   You can set up user impersonation programmatically. To do so, use the
   UserGroupInformation.doAs() method in the Hadoop documentation. See
   [6]Class UserGroupInformation for more information.

   If you are setting up user impersonation in a secure cluster, you need
   to generation an impersonation ticket. See the Generating and Printing
   Service with Impersonation Ticket section in the [7]maprlogin Command
   Examples topic.
   After generating the ticket:
    1. Ensure that mapruser1 has read permissions on the ticket.
    2. If you moved the ticket file to a different location, set the
       $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable.

   For more information about impersonation, see:
     * [8]How Impersonation Works
     * [9]Generating a Service with Impersonation Ticket
     * [10]Managing Impersonation

Backward Compatibility

   As of MapR 6.0.1, along with support of Apache Kafka the
   java.util.Collection interface is being used. This impacts applications
   using certain APIs. See [11]MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Java API
   Library for detailed information.
