MapR-ES Java Applications

   This section contains information on developing client applications
   with Java including information about the MapR-ES and Apache Kafka Java
   APIs, configuration parameters, and compiling and running producers and
   consumers.

Apache Kafka Support

   The following Apache Kafka Java API versions are supported:

   CAPTION: Table 1. Supported Apache Kafka APIs

     MapR version    Apache Kafka API
   As of 6.0.1       1.0
   6.0.0 and earlier 0.9.0

TimestampType Permissions

   The following describes the ACE permissions are needed when using the
   timestamp type parameter. See [1]Stream Security for general
   information about MapR-ES streams security.
   Note: The TimestampType parameter is new as of 6.0.1.

   A MapR-ES stream topic inherits the default timestamp type value from
   its stream. To override the stream's default value, set the timestamp
   type for the topic to a different value.
     * Setting the value at the stream-level requires adminperm
       permissions. The stream-level timestamp type parameter is
       defaulttimestamptype. See [2]stream create and [3]stream edit for
       more information on setting this parameter through the maprcli.
     * Setting the timestamptype at the topic-level requires topicperm
       permissions. The topic-level timestamp type parameter is
       timestamptype. See [4]stream topic create and [5]stream topic edit
       for more information on setting this parameter through the maprcli.

User Impersonation

   Note: As of MapR 6.0, user impersonation is supported for MapR-ES.

   You can set up user impersonation programmatically. To do so, use the
   UserGroupInformation.doAs() method in the Hadoop documentation. See
   [6]Class UserGroupInformation for more information.

   If you are setting up user impersonation in a secure cluster, you need
   to generation an impersonation ticket. See the Generating and Printing
   Service with Impersonation Ticket section in the [7]maprlogin Command
   Examples topic.
   After generating the ticket:
    1. Ensure that mapruser1 has read permissions on the ticket.
    2. If you moved the ticket file to a different location, set the
       $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable.

   For more information about impersonation, see:
     * [8]How Impersonation Works
     * [9]Generating a Service with Impersonation Ticket
     * [10]Managing Impersonation

Backward Compatibility

   As of MapR 6.0.1, along with support of Apache Kafka the
   java.util.Collection interface is being used. This impacts applications
   using certain APIs. See [11]MapR-ES Java API Library for detailed
   information.
