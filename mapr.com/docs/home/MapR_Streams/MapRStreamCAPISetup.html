Configuring the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client

   After installing the MapR Client and before developing applications,
   you must configure your client C library by setting the library path.

Linux

   For Linux installations, add /opt/mapr/lib to the end of
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mapr/lib

   Important: For MapR 6.0.1, the libjvm.so configuration is not required.
   For MapR 6.0.0 and earlier, add the /opt/mapr/lib and the path to the
   directory that contains libjvm.so to the end of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mapr/lib:<path_to_libjvm.so_directo
ry>

   The location of the libjvm.so differs based on where you installed
   Java. You can use find / -name libjvm* to determine the file location.
   For example, if the libjvm.so file is in the following location:
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so

   Then, you set the library path like this:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mapr/lib:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjd
k-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/server/

Mac

   For Mac installations, add /opt/mapr/lib to the end of
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mapr/lib

   Important: For MapR 6.0.1, the libjvm.so configuration is not required.
   For MapR 6.0.0 and earlier, add /opt/mapr/lib and the path to the
   directory that contains libjvm.dylib to the end of DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mapr/lib:<path_to_libjvm.dylib_
directory>

   The location of the libjvm.dylib differs based on where you installed
   Java. You can use find / -name libjvm* to determine the file location.
   For example, if the libjvm.dylib file is in the following location:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/server/
libjvm.dylib

   Then, you set the library path like this:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mapr/lib:/Library/Java/JavaVirt
ualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/server

Windows

   Note: As of MapR 6.0.1, the MapR C client is available on Windows.

   For Windows installations, no additional configuration is required.
   Link your application and run your programs against the MapR Client
   dynampic link libraries (dll) located at: C:\opt\mapr\lib. The
   corresponding librdkafka header is C:\opt\mapr\include\librdkafka.
