Consuming Audit Logs

   Audit Streaming (available from v6.0.1) provides a way to process the
   audit data in real-time.

   When audit streaming is enabled,the MapR Data Platform generates audit
   logs that are sent as an audit stream, opening the possibility of
   real-time processing of the audit data. See [1]Streaming Audit Logs for
   more information.

   Use the sample consumer application, or build your custom consumer
   application, to consume the audit logs that are available as a stream
   topic, when audit streaming is enabled.

   The sample application uses Filesystem APIs to get the file path and
   name from the FID, and the volume name from the volume ID.

Determine When to use Cached or Uncached Version of the Filesystem API

   Caching the file path and file name, along with the volume name at the
   initial API call, reduces the load on CLDB for subsequent API calls.

   However, there could be cases when the uncached version of the
   application is more suitable for use. Consider the following example:

   For the initial API call, File1 is returned as the file name for FID 1.
   The result is cached.

   The file is then renamed to File2. For subsequent API calls, to get the
   file name for FID 1, the result from the cache is used. The cache,
   unaware of the rename operation, returns the name as File1, which is
   incorrect, as the file is already renamed to File2. For such a case,
   use the uncached version.

   Evaluate your use case, and then use the cached, or the uncached
   version, as appropriate.
