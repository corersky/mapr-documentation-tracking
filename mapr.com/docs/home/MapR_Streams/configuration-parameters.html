Configuration Parameters

   This topic describes configuration parameters that are either specific
   to MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka or supported from Apache Kafka.
     * [1]AdminClient
     * [2]Consumer
     * [3]Producer

   CAPTION: Table 1. AdminClient configuration parameters specific to MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka

   Parameter Description
   streams.admin.default.stream This parameter, when set during creation
   of the AdminClient instance, ensures that the specified stream is using
   the the AdminClient instance for all administrative operations.

   Syntax:
/mapr/<cluster name>/<volume name>/<stream name>

   streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   Specifies the length of time in milliseconds to wait for a response
   from the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server if soft mount is
   configured (fs.mapr.hardmount is set to false). Default: 120000
   Minimum: 30000
   Note: Applicable as of MapR 6.0.1, is used instead of
   fs.mapr.rpc.timeout

   For producer and consumer applications, make sure the
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms configuration value for both producers and
   consumers is set to greater than 50000 to avoid Message Fetch RPC
   overload.

   CAPTION: Table 2. Consumer configuration parameters specific to MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka

   Parameter Description
   streams.consumer.buffer.memory Specifies how much memory to use for
   caching pre-fetched messages. Messages that are in subscribed topics
   and partitions are pre-fetched and cached to improve performance.
   Default 64MB
   streams.consumer.default.stream Specifies the path and name of the
   stream that the consumer subscribes to if, when subscribing to a topic,
   the consumer does not specify a stream.

   This default value is also used for the [4]KafkaConsumer.listTopics()
   method.
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms

   Specifies the length of time in milliseconds to wait for a response
   from the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server if a soft mount is
   configured (fs.mapr.hardmount is set to false). Default: 305000
   Minimum: 300000

   For producer and consumer applications, make sure the
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms configuration value for both producers and
   consumers is set to greater than 50000 to avoid Message Fetch RPC
   overload.

   CAPTION: Table 3. Consumer configuration parameters supported from
   Apache Kafka

   Parameter Description
   auto.commit.interval.ms The frequency in milliseconds that the offsets
   are committed. Default: 1000ms
   auto.offset.reset Specifies what MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   should do when there is no initial offset, such as when a consumer
   starts reading from a partition. Default: latest

   earliest
          Reset the offset to the offset of the earliest message in the
          partition.

   latest
          Reset the offset to the offset of the latest message in the
          partition.

   none
          Throws a [5]NoOffsetForPartitionException exception when the
          consumer next polls for messages in its subscription and no
          offset exists. The consumer must unsubscribe from the partition
          before polling functions correctly. Any other value throws an
          error to the consumer.

   enable.auto.commit If true, periodically commits the highest offsets of
   the messages fetched by the consumer in all of the partitions for the
   topics that the consumer is subscribed to. Default: true
   fetch.min.bytes The minimum amount of data the server should return for
   a fetch request. If insufficient data is available, the server will
   wait for this minimum amount of data to accumulate before answering the
   request.

   This minimum applies to the totality of what a consumer has subscribed
   to.

   Works in conjunction with the timeout interval that is specified in the
   poll function. If the minimum number of bytes is not reached by the
   time that the interval expires, the poll returns with nothing.

   For example, suppose the value is set to 6 bytes and the timeout on a
   poll is set to 100ms. If there are 5 bytes available and no further
   bytes come in before the 100ms expire, the poll returns with nothing.
   Default: 1 byte
   fetch.max.bytes
   The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch
   request. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of
   the fetch is larger than this configuration, the record batch is still
   returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress.
   Note: This parameter is new as of MapR 6.0.1.
   fetch.max.wait.ms The maximum amount of time the MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka server will block before answering the fetch request if
   there isn't sufficient data to satisfy the requirement given by
   fetch.min.bytes.
   group.id A string 2457 up to bytes long that uniquely identifies the
   group of consumer processes to which this consumer belongs. By setting
   the same group ID, multiple consumer processes indicate that they are
   all part of the same consumer group. Putting consumers into groups
   provides benefits that are described in [6]Consumer Groups.

   It is possible for a single consumer to be in a group.
   key.deserializer The class that implements the [7]Deserializer
   interface for deserializing keys.
   max.poll.records Places an upper bound on the number of records
   returned from each call.
   Note: This parameter is new as of MapR 6.0.1.
   max.partition.fetch.bytes The number of bytes of message data to
   attempt to fetch for each partition in each poll request. These bytes
   will be read into memory for each partition, so this parameter helps
   control the memory that the consumer uses. Default: 64KB

   The size of the poll request must be at least as large as the maximum
   message size that the server allows or else it is possible for
   producers to send messages that are larger than the consumer can fetch.
   If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch
   is larger than this configuration, the record batch is still returned
   to ensure that the consumer can make progress.
   Note: This is a behavior change as of MapR 6.0.1.
   value.deserializer The name of the appropriate deserialization class in
   the [8]org.apache.kafka.common.serialization package or a class that
   implements the [9]Deserializer interface for deserializing values.

   CAPTION: Table 4. Producer configuration parameters specific to MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka

   Parameter Description
   streams.buffer.max.time.ms Messages are buffered in the producer for at
   most the specified time. A thread will flush all the messages that have
   been buffered for more than the time specified. Default: 3 * 1000 msec
   create default stream
   streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition If enabled, producer may have
   multiple parallel send requests to the server for each topic partition.
   If this setting is set to true, it is possible for messages to be sent
   out of order. Default: true create default stream
   streams.partitioner.class The class that implements the
   [10]StreamsPartitioner interface. This interface lets you write custom
   algorithms for determining which topic and partition to use for
   messages that match specific criteria. Use this configuration parameter
   only for producers that are written in Java. create default stream
   streams.producer.default.stream Specifies the stream that the producer
   will use by default if the producer does not provide the name of a
   stream when specifying a topic to write to.
   Syntax:
/mapr/<cluster name>/<volume name>/<stream name>

   create default stream
   fs.mapr.hardmount Specifies whether to use a hard mount or a soft mount
   for connections to the MapR Streams server.

   The default is to use a hard mount and the value is true.

   If a value for this parameter is set in the core-site.xml file, the
   value in that file is ignored.
   create default stream
   fs.mapr.rpc.timeout Specifies the length of time in seconds to wait for
   a response from the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server if the
   configuration parameter fs.mapr.hardmount is set to false. Default:
   300. Minimum value: 30.
   Note: Applicable to MapR 6.0.0 and earlier. As of MapR 6.0.1, use
   streams.mapr.timeout.ms.

   If a soft mount is used, the time expires while a producer waits for a
   response from the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server, and the
   producer used the KafkaProducer.send(ProducerRecord<K,V> record,
   Callback callback) method, the callback is invoked with the error
   EAGAIN, which means "Resource temporarily unavailable."
   create default stream
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms

   Specifies the length of time in milliseconds to wait for a response
   from the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server if soft mount is
   configured (fs.mapr.hardmount is set to false). Default: 30000 Minimum:
   30000

   For producer and consumer applications, make sure the
   streams.rpc.timeout.ms configuration value for both producers and
   consumers is set to greater than 50000 to avoid Message Fetch RPC
   overload.

   CAPTION: Table 5. Producer configuration parameters supported from
   Apache Kafka

   Parameter Description
   buffer.memory The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer
   records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are generated
   faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will
   block. Default: 33554432
   client.id Producers can tag records with a client ID that identifies
   the producer. Consumers can then be aware of which producer sent a
   message or set of messages. Apache Drill or other analytic tools
   querying messages can include this ID in the filters for their queries.
   Default: No client ID.
   key.serializer The name of the appropriate serialization class in the
   [11]org.apache.kafka.common.serialization package or a class that
   implements the [12]Serializer interface for serializing keys.
   metadata.max.age.ms The producer generally refreshes the topic metadata
   from the server when there is a failure. It will also poll for this
   data regularly. Default: 300 * 1000 msec
   value.serializer The class that implements the [13]Serializer interface
   for serializing values.
