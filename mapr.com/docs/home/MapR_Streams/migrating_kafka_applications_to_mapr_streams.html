Migrating Apache Kafka Java Applications to MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka

   There are only two steps that you need to follow to migrate
   applications written with the Apache Kafka Java API to MapR Event Store
   For Apache Kafka.
   The following steps assume that migration is from either:
     * Apache Kafka 1.1 to MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka 6.1 or higher
     * Apache Kafka 1.0 to MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka 6.0.1 or
       higher
     * Apache Kafka 0.9.0 to MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka 6.0.0 or
       earlier

   Important: For information on backward compatibility, see [1]MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka Java API Library
    1. Change the names of topics to include the path and name of the MapR
       Stream stream in which the topic is located.
       Here is the syntax to use:
/<path and name of stream>:<name of topic>
       For example, you might have a stream in a MapR cluster that is
       named stream_A, and the stream might be in a volume named IoT and
       in a directory named automobile_sensors. You want to redirect a
       producer application to a topic in that stream. The syntax of the
       path to the topic might look like this:
/mapr/IoT/automobile_sensors/stream_A:<name of topic>
    2. If a producer application uses the Kafka interface Partitioner to
       compute which partitions to publish messages to, revise the
       application so that it uses the Kafka StreamsPartitioner interface
       instead.
