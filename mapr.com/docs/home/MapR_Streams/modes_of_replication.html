Modes of Stream Replication

   You can replicate streams in one of two replication modes. You specify
   the mode per source-replica pair.

Asynchronous replication

   In this replication mode, MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka confirms to
   producers that messages are published after the messages are placed in
   partitions. Messages are replicated in the background. Therefore, the
   latency of message publishing is not affected by the time required for
   the network round trip between the source cluster and the destination
   cluster.

   This type of replication is well-suited for clusters that are
   geographically separated in wide-area networks.

   Asynchronous replication is the default replication mode.

Synchronous replication

   In this replication mode, MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka confirms to
   producers that messages have been placed in partitions only after the
   messages are sent to a gateway in the destination cluster.

   Because of the confirmations that MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   receives on source clusters, synchronous replication is especially
   well-suited for creating a backup of your data for disaster recovery.

   When the latency of a replication stream is high, MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka switches to asynchronous replication temporarily so that
   producers are not blocked indefinitely. After the latency is
   sufficiently reduced, MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka switches back
   to synchronous replication.

   The same switching from synchronous to asynchronous replication occurs
   if all gateways fail. MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka does not resume
   synchronous replication until a new gateway is established or at least
   one of the failed gateways is restarted.
