Configuration Properties for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client

   This topic describes the configuration properties supported by the MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client. This includes librdkafka
   configuration properties that MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   supports and additional properties that are specific to MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka.

Global Configuration Properties

   Property Name Behavior
   client.id Same as librdkafka.
   message.max.bytes

   For a C producer, the message.max.bytes value is 1000000 B by default.
   The minimum value is 1000 B and maximum value is 32000000 B. The
   maximum message size produced by a C API is decided by the
   message.max.bytes value set on the C producer. From C, Python, and C#
   APIs, the maximum message size that can be produced is 32000000 B. If a
   C consumer needs to consume a message that is greater than 32000000 B
   in size, which may be produced by a Java client, the consumer needs to
   update the message.max.bytes or receive.message.max.bytes properties to
   a higher value to consume it. If the message.max.bytes property is set
   to greater than 32000000 B, it is by default capped at 32000000 B.
   Though a consumer can consume messages greater than 32000000 B
   (produced say by a Java client), only up to 32000000 B is produced from
   the MapR C client. The maximum message size consumed by a C API is
   limited by the message.max.bytes and receive.message.max.bytes values.
   receive.message.max.bytes For a C consumer, the
   receive.message.max.bytes is 1000000 B by default. The minimum value is
   1000 B and maximum value is 1000000000 B.
   topic.blacklist Same as librdkafka.
   error_cb Same as librdkafka.
   opaque Same as librdkafka.
   queue.buffering.max.ms Same as librdkafka.
   enable.partition.eof Same as librdkafka. Available as of librdkafka
   0.11.3. Supported as of MapR 6.0.1.
   queue.buffering.max.kbytes Same as librdkafka. Available as of
   librdkafka 0.11.3. Supported as of MapR 6.0.1.

Consumer Configuration Properties

         Property Name             Behavior
   default_topic_conf         Same as librdkafka.
   group.id                   Same as librdkafka.
   enable.auto.commit         Same as librdkafka.
   auto.commit.interval.ms    Same as librdkafka.
   rebalance_cb               Same as librdkafka.
   offset_commit_cb           Same as librdkafka.
   delivery.report.only.error Same as librdkafka.
   dr_msg_cb                  Same as librdkafka.

Topic Configuration

   Property Name Behavior
   partitioner_cb Same as librdkafka.
   auto.offset.reset Supports the following values: beginning, end,
   earliest, latest, none, smallest, and largest. As of MapR 6.0.1,
   beginning and end are supported.
   Note: librdkafka additionally supports error.

MapR-Specific Configurations

   Property Name Behavior
   streams.consumer.default.stream Specifies the path and name of the
   stream that the consumer subscribes to if, when subscribing to a topic,
   the consumer does not specify a stream. For example, the consumer can
   specify the name of a stream together with the name of a topic to write
   to, like this: /<stream>:<topic>.
   Note: rd_kafka_list groups API uses this consumer configuration to
   obtain the consumer groups.
   streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition Enables the producer to have
   multiple parallel send requests to the server for each topic partition.
   When this property is set to true, the default value, it is possible
   for messages to be sent out of order.
   streams.producer.default.stream Specifies the stream that the producer
   will use by default if the producer does not provide the name of a
   stream when specifying a topic to write to. For example, the producer
   can specify the name of a stream together with the name of a topic to
   write to, like this: /<stream>:<topic>. However, if the stream is not
   specified, the value of this configuration parameter is assumed to be
   the stream in which the topic is located. If the producer specifies the
   name of a topic without also providing the path and name of the stream,
   and there is no value for this configuration parameter, MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka assumes that the topic specified is in Apache
   Kafka and does nothing.
