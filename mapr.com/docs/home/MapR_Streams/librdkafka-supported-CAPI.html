librdkafka APIs Supported by MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client

   This topic lists the librdkafka APIs supported by the MapR Event Store
   For Apache Kafka C Client. It also describes behavior differences
   between librdkafka and the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client.

   CAPTION: Table 1. Supported Apache Kafka librdkafka versions

            MapR release          MEP Release Kafka librdkafka version
   As of MapR 6.0.1               As of 5.0   0.11.3
   As of MapR 5.2.1 through 6.0.0 As of 3.0   0.9.0
   This topic contains the following supported APIs:
     * [1]Producer APIs
     * [2]Consumer APIs
     * [3]Producer/Consumer Common APIs
     * [4]Topic APIs
     * [5]Queue APIs
     * [6]Event APIs
     * [7]Timestamp APIs
     * [8]Interceptors APIs
     * [9]Cluster Configuration APIs
     * [10]Miscellaneous API

Producer APIs

   CAPTION:

   API Behavior
   rd_kafka_flush Same as librdkafka. Available as of librdkafka 0.11.3.
   Supported as of MapR 6.0.1.
   rd_kafka_poll Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_produce When this API is called with NULL payload, an invalid
   argument error is sent to the callback. librdkafka creates a message
   with NULL payload and key value instead.
   rd_kafka_producev Same as librdkafka. This API should be used with
   either RD_KAFKA_V_TOPIC or RD_KAFKA_V_RKT. Available as of librdkafka
   0.11.3. Supported as of MapR 6.0.1.
   rd_kafka_produce_batch When this API is called with NULL payload, an
   invalid argument error is sent to the callback. librdkafka creates a
   message with NULL payload and key value instead.
   rd_kafka_outq_len This API returns a positive number to indicate that
   messages are waiting to be produced to a MapR streams topic but the
   value does not indicate the actual number of messages. librdkafka
   returns the actual number of messages that are waiting to be sent to or
   acknowledged by the broker.

Consumer APIs

   CAPTION:

   API Behavior
   rd_kafka_assign If this API is called for a consumer that is already
   subscribed to topics, no operation is performed.
   rd_kafka_assignment This API returns the number of topic partitions the
   consumer is assigned to. However, it returns 0 when topic partitions
   have yet to be created by the producer. librdkafka returns the number
   of partitions assigned to a consumer even when the partitions have not
   been created.
   Note: For this API to work, the argument partitions must be explicitly
   allocated or initialized with either rd_kafka_topic_partition_list_t
   *parts = NULL or rd_kafka_topic_partition_list_new(0);. For example:
RD_EXPORT rd_kafka_resp_err_t
rd_kafka_assignment (rd_kafka_t *rk,
                     rd_kafka_topic_partition_list_t **partitions);

   rd_kafka_commit Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_commit_message Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_committed Same as librdkafka.
   Note: The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka offset starts at 1.
   rd_kafka_consumer_close Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_consumer_poll Same as librdkafka.
   Note:

   For librdkafka 0.9: If the consume callback was set and messages were
   polled using rd_kafka_consumer_poll(), then the consume callback gets
   called and the messages can be consumed in the callback.

   For librdkafka 0.11.3: If the consume callback is set and messages are
   polled using rd_kafka_consumer_poll(), the consume callback is not
   called. The result is that you cannot consume messages in the consume
   callback when using rd_kafka_consumer_poll().
   rd_kafka_group_list_destroy Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_list_groups This API can only be used by consumers that are
   subscribed to at least one stream on the cluster and have a default
   stream configured with the streams.consumer.default.stream parameter.
   It returns the group list of subscribed consumers associated with the
   default stream. librdkafka returns all consumer groups from the cluster
   instead.
   Note: This API returns RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR__TIMED_OUT when the querying
   consumer is not subscribed to any topic.
   rd_kafka_message_destroy Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_poll_set_consumer Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_position This API returns 0 when the messages have not yet
   been consumed from partitions. librdkafka returns -1001 instead.
   rd_kafka_seek Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_subscribe Same as librdkafka.
   rd_kafka_subscription This API allows either a list of topics from one
   or more streams or a regex expression for topics from a single streams.
   For example, regex expression /streamA:^t*a,/streamA:^t*b is supported
   but /streamA:^t*a,/streamB:^t*a is not supported. librdkafka accepts
   both options in the same call.
   Note: You cannot use the rd_kafka_subscribe API to subscribe a consumer
   to topics when that consumer is already assigned to topics. If you call
   this API for an assigned consumer, error RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR__CONFLICT is
   returned.
   rd_kafka_unsubscribe Same as librdkafka.

Cluster Configuration APIs

   CAPTION:

   rd_kafka_brokers_add

   This API has no impact on MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka since MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka does not utilize Kafka brokers. When this

   rd_kafka_query_watermark_offsets When you are querying or retrieving a
   topic that is non-existent topic/partition (using
   rd_kafka_query_watermark_offsets() and rd_kafka_get_watermark_offsets()
   APIs), the timeout is honored even though you still receive the correct
   error message.

   Supported as of MapR 6.0.1.
   rd_kafka_get_watermark_offsets When you are querying or retrieving a
   topic that is non-existent topic/partition (using
   rd_kafka_query_watermark_offsets() and rd_kafka_get_watermark_offsets()
   APIs), the timeout is honored even though you still receive the correct
