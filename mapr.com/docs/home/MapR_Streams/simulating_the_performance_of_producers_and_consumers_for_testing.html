Utilities for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka

   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka provides the utilities for operating
   on streams and topics.
   Note: MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka can not use MapR Database Shell
   to perform operations on streams or topics.

   [1]mapr copystream
          This utility copies data from one MapR stream to another MapR
          stream. You can use it, for example, if you want to set up
          replication manually from one stream to another.

   [2]mapr diffstreams
          This utility compares the message IDs, metadata, and data in two
          MapR streams. Then, generates two directories that contain
          sequence files that you can use to merge the rows from the two
          MapR streams.

   [3]mapr diffstreamswithcrc
          This utility uses a cyclic redundancy check to detect
          differences between sets of messages in the specified MapR
          streams. Then, for each set of non-identical messages, it
          performs a detailed comparison. Finally, it generates one or
          more directories of sequence files. You can use these files
          either to make a MapR stream identical to its master or merge
          the messages from two MapR streams.

   [4]mapr exportstream and mapr importstream
          Use these utilities together to export data from MapR streams
          into binary sequence files, and then import the data from the
          binary sequence files into other MapR streams. You can also use
          the mapr importstream utility to import changes that are
          specified in sequence files output by the mapr diffstreams
          utility.

   [5]mapr perfconsumer
          This utility runs a consumer reading messages from topics in a
          MapR stream. Use this utility to run consumers when you want to
          estimate the performance of consumers for your MapR Event Store
          For Apache Kafka applications, given your network configuration.

   [6]mapr perfproducer
          This utility runs a producer, generating messages and publishing
          them to a MapR stream. Use this utility to run producers when
          you want to estimate the performance of producers for your MapR
          Event Store For Apache Kafka applications, given your network
          configuration.

   [7]mapr streamanalyzer
          This light-weight utility, which is a sample application for the
          Streams Java class for analytics on MapR streams, lets you count
          the messages in a stream or a subset of the topics in a stream.
          The utility also lets you print either whole retrieved messages
          or a subset of the fields in each message.
