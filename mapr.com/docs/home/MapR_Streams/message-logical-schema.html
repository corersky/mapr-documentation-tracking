Logical Schema of Messages

   Each message has the same logical schema: _id, topic, partition,
   offset, timestamp, producer, key, and value.

   Because the logical schema of each message is the same, analytics
   applications can run queries on these fields. See [1]MapR-ES Java API
   Library for information about querying messages and [2]mapr
   streamanalyzer for a sample application used to query and count
   messages in topics.
{
          "_id":<STRING>,
          "topic":<STRING>,
          "partition":<SHORT>,
          "offset":<LONG>,
          "timestamp":<LONG>,
          "producer":<VARCHAR>,
          "key":<BINARY>,
          "value":<VARBINARY>
          }

   Field Description
   _id A STRING value that represents the ID of the topic in which the
   message is located.
   topic A STRING value that represents the name of the topic in which the
   message is located.
   partition A SHORT value that represents the index of the partition in
   the topic.
   offset A LONG value that represents the position of the message within
   a partition.
   timestamp A LONG value that represents the date and time of the
   message. As of MapR 6.0.1, MapR-ES supports an event-time timestamp.
   The timestamp type can be either createtime (default) or logappendtime.

   A createtime value (default) is the time defined by the user or
   application (when creating the message). If user or application does
   not define this value (or passes null), the client uses the current
   system timestamp.

   A logappendtime value is the time when the message (log) was appended
   to the server.
   Tip: Because each message is automatically produced into a
   topic-partition with an event-time timestamp as part of the message
   record, this allows the Consumer to seek based on the timestamp.
   producer A VARCHAR value that represents the value of the client.id
   configuration parameter for the producer that published the message.
   MapR-ES does not require a value for this configuration parameter, so
   the value for this field could be empty.
   key A BINARY value that represents the key of the message. MapR-ES does
   not require each message to have a key, so this value could be empty.
   The configuration parameter key.serializer for the producer that
   published the message specifies the means by which the key was
   serialized.

   Your application can deserialize the key by using the appropriate
   deserialization class in the [3]org.apache.kafka.common.serialization
   package or a class that implements the [4]Deserializer interface.
   value A VARBINARY value that represents the value of the message. The
   configuration parameter value.serializer for the producer that
   published the message specifies the means by which the value was
   serialized.

   Your application can deserialize the value by using the appropriate
   deserialization class in the [5]org.apache.kafka.common.serialization
   package or a class that implements the [6]Deserializer interface.
