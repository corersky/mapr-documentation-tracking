MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka and Apps

   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka brings integrated publish and
   subscribe messaging to the MapR Converged Data Platform.

   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka is built into the MapR platform. It
   requires no additional process to manage, leverages the same
   architecture as the rest of the platform, and requires minimal
   additional management.

   Attention: As of MapR 6.1, the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka API
   enforces a maximum of 4096 partitions for a topic. If you create an
   application with the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka 6.1 API, the
   maximum number of partitions is 4096. If you previously created an
   application with MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka 6.0.1 API (or older)
   and you've upgraded, the original number of partitions can be used. For
   example, if you were using more than 4096 partitions in MapR 6.0.1 or
   earlier, you will able to continue with the same number of partitions
   after upgrading.
