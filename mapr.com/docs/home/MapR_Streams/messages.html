Topic Messages

   Messages are key/value pairs, where keys are optional. The values
   contain the data payload, which can be text, images, video files, or
   any other types of data.

   Messages are published into topic partitions by Producer applications
   and are read by Consumer applications. All messages published to
   MapR-ES are persisted, allowing future consumers to “catch-up” on
   processing and analytics applications to process historical data. See
   [1]Producers and [2]Consumers for more information.

Offsets

   Messages are assigned offsets when published to partitions. Offsets are
   monotonically increasing and are local to partitions. The order of
   messages is preserved within individual partitions, but not across
   partitions.
   Note: As of MapR 6.0, the message offset in a partition starts from
   zero (0). If you are upgrading and did not enable the MapR-DB/ES
   features, mfs.feature.db.streams.v6.support, the message offset in a
   partition starts from one (1).
