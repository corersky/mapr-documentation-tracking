Configuration Properties for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client

   In the instance constructor of a MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   Python application, you can use a dictionary to set the following
   configuration properties. MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python
   client supports a superset of the configuration properties supported by
   the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C client.

Global Configuration Properties

   Property Name Behavior
   client.id Same as librdkafka
   default.topic.config A dictionary of topic-level configuration
   properties that are applied to all used topics for the instance.
   message.max.bytes Supports a value less than or equal to 10MB
   (10000000). If this property is set to a value that is higher than
   10MB, the client issues a warning and sets the configuration to 10MB.
   Produce calls fail when the message size is greater than 10MB.
   receive.message.max.bytes Same as librdkafka
   topic.blacklist Same as librdkafka
   error_cb A callback for generic/global error events. This callback is
   served by poll().
   opaque Same as librdkafka.

Consumer Configuration Properties

   Property Name Behavior
   group.id Same as librdkafka.
   enable.auto.commit Same as librdkafka.
   auto.commit.interval.ms Same as librdkafka.
   rebalance_cb Same as librdkafka.
   offset_commit_cb Same as librdkafka.
   delivery.report.only.error Same as librdkafka.
   dr_msg_cb Same as librdkafka.
   on_commit A callback used to indicate success or failure of commit
   requests.

Topic Configuration Properties

   Property Name Behavior
   partitioner_cb Same as librdkafka.
   auto.offset.reset Supports the following values: earliest, latest,
   none, smallest, and largest. librdkafka also supports biggest, end and
   error.

Producer Configuration Properties

   Property Name Behavior
   on_delivery(kafka.KafkaError, kafka.Message) A Python function
   reference that is called once for each produced message to indicate the
   final delivery result (success or failure). This property may also be
   set per-message by passing callback=callable (or on_delivery=callable)
   to the confluent_kafka.Producer.produce() function.

MapR-Specific Configuration Properties

   Property Name Behavior
   streams.consumer.default.stream Specifies the path and name of the
   stream that the consumer subscribes to if, when subscribing to a topic,
   the consumer does not specify a stream. For example, the consumer can
   specify the name of a stream together with the name of a topic to write
   to, like this: /<stream>:<topic>.
   Note: rd_kafka_list groups API uses this consumer configuration to
   obtain the consumer groups.
   streams.parallel.flushers.per.partition Enables the producer may have
   multiple parallel send requests to the server for each topic partition.
   If this setting is set to true, it is possible for messages to be sent
   out of order.
   streams.producer.default.stream Specifies the stream that the producer
   will use by default if the producer does not provide the name of a
   stream when specifying a topic to write to. For example, the producer
   can specify the name of a stream together with the name of a topic to
   write to, like this: /<stream>:<topic>. However, if the stream is not
   specified, the value of this configuration parameter is assumed to be
   the stream in which the topic is located. If the producer specifies the
   name of a topic without also providing the path and name of the stream,
   and there is no value for this configuration parameter, MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka assumes that the topic specified is in Apache
   Kafka and does nothing.

Additional Information

   Here is a consumer configuration example:
conf = {'group.id': 'mygroup',

'session.timeout.ms': 6000,

'on_commit': my_commit_callback,

'default.topic.config': {'auto.offset.reset': 'smallest'}}

consumer = mapr_streams_python.Consumer(**conf)
