Monitoring Cluster Nodes that Host Partitions

   You can find out which nodes in a MapR cluster are being used for
   topics in a stream by running the command maprcli stream topic info.
   The nodes are listed in the servers field.

   The guts utility can show you whether there are any I/O bottlenecks on
   these nodes. This utility can also show you whether there is any
   capacity on other nodes in the cluster that you can take advantage of
   by creating additional partitions for topics.

   To run this utility, issue this command after logging into the MapR
   cluster that you want statistics for:
/opt/mapr/bin/guts

   You can also use the guts utility to show only these statistics from
   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka:

   CAPTION: Table 1.

   Name Description
   mpr The number of RPCs from MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka producers
   to the server.
   mpm The number of messages that have been published to the server.
   mpMB The total size in MB of the messages that have been published to
   the server.
   mlr The number of RPCs from MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka consumers
   to the server.
   mlm The number of messages that have been read from the server.
   mcl The number of concurrent RPCs from consumers to the server.
   mlMB The total size in MB of the messages that have been read from the
   server.

   To see these statistics, run this command:
/opt/mapr/bin/guts streams:all

   Note: These statistics are for the most recent sample period at the
   time the command is run, and are not cumulative. Sample periods are one
   second.
