Migrating Kafka C Applications to MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka

   With some modification, you can use existing Kafka C applications to
   consume and produce topics in MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka. The
   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client is a distribution of
   librdkafka that is compatible with MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka.
    1. Install and [1]configure the MapR Streams C Client.
    2. When you refer to a topic in the application code, include the path
       and name of the stream in which the topic is located:
/<path and name of stream>:<name of topic>
       For example, you might have a stream in a MapR cluster that is
       named stream_A, and the stream might be in a volume named IoT and
       in a directory named automobile_sensors. You want to redirect a
       producer application to a topic in that stream. The syntax of the
       path to the topic might look like this:
       /mapr/IoT/automobile_sensors/stream_A:<name of topic>.
       Note: Optionally, use the streams.consumer.default.stream and
       streams.producer.default.stream configuration parameters. When you
       configure these parameters, applications can specify just the topic
       name to write or read from the default stream. To use these
       MapR-specific parameters in your application, compile your
       application with the rdkafka.h file
       (/opt/mapr/include/librdkafka/rdkafka.h) that was installed with
       the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client. See the [2]Compile
       the Apps section of [3]Developing a MapR Event Store For Apache
       Kafka C Application.
    3. See [4]Configuration Properties for MapR Event Store For Apache
       Kafka C Client for the list of supported configuration parameters,
       including a few parameters that are MapR-specific. Make changes to
       your application, as needed.
       Note: SSL-related configuration parameters are ignored. When you
       set these parameters, the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Client
       issues a warning indicating that the parameters are not supported.
    4. Review the list of librdkafka APIs that are not supported by the
       MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client and make changes to your
       application, as needed.
