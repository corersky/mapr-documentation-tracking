Consumer Groups

   You can group consumers together by setting the same value for the
   group.id configuration parameter when you start each consumer.

   For example, if you create three consumers and give each of them the
   group ID clickstream_consumers, together these consumers form the
   consumer group clickstream_consumers. MapR-ES does not generate IDs for
   consumer groups. You can create IDs that make sense for your purposes.
   You specify the group ID by using the group.id configuration parameter
   when you create a consumer. IDs are strings that can be up to 2457
   bytes long.

   You can even create a consumer group that consists of only one
   consumer. In such a case, the unique ID that identifies the group would
   be shared with no other consumers.

   These are the benefits to creating consumer groups:
