Consumers

   Consumers are applications that you create such as analytics
   applications, reporting tools, or enterprise dashboards.

   They use the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka APIs to request messages
   from topics that they are interested in. In case of server failure,
   consumer clients continually retry requests automatically. A consumer
   client library sends unread messages, which consumers extract data
   from.

   Consumers can run as separate processes on a single machine and as
   processes on different machines.
   Before a consumer can read messages from topics, the user ID running
   the consumer needs these permissions:
     * The readAce permission on the volume where the streams are located.
       For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see
       [1]Setting Whole Volume ACEs.
     * The consumeperm permission on the streams where the topics are
       located. Users with the adminperm permission on those streams can
       grant the consumeperm permission.

Subscriptions

   Consumers subscribe to topics. When a consumer subscribes to a topic or
   partition, it means that the consumer wants to receive messages from
   that topic or partition. For example, an analytics application might
   subscribe to the topics rfids_productA, rfids_productB, and more to
   track movement of products from factories to distribution centers. A
   reporting tool might subscribe to the topics meters_NW, meters_SW, and
   more to get a report of electricity usage in different geographic
   regions that a power company services.

   A subscription is the list of the topics that a consumer is subscribed
   to.
