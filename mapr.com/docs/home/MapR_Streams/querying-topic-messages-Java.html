Querying Topic Messages

   Describes how MapR-ES topic messages can be queried.

Time-based Querying

   The consumer.offsetsForTimesAPI is used to get offsets in a
   topic-partition. This API takes in a Map of TopicPartition and
   timestamp. The offset is returned in an OffsetAndTimestamp object when
   offsetsForTime is called.
   The following shows how the Map is constructed:
Long timestamp = 1522195205L;
TopicPartition topicPartition = new TopicPartition(topic,partition);

HashMap<TopicPartition, Long> offsetsForTimesMap = new HashMap<TopicPartition, L
ong>();
offsetsForTimesMap.put(topicPartition, timestamp);

// Invocation to offsetsForTimes
Map<TopicPartition, OffsetAndTimestamp> offsetForTimesResultMap = consumer.offse
tsForTimes(offsetsForTimesMap);

Direct Querying

   The Streams class is used to directly query topic messages. See the
   [1]mapr streamanalyzer utility for a sample application that counts and
   queries topic messages.
     * The getMessageStore() APIs are used to get the DocumentStore object
       which represents the underlying topic messages for a specified
       stream.
     * The DocumentStore.find() APIs are used to query the messages that
       are in the DocumentStore object. While running find() on the
       returned [2]DocumentStore object, message fields can be projected
       based on the specified field name.

   Note: DocumentStore is a part of the open-source [3]OJAI API.

   The logical schema of each message is the same, where analytics
   applications can run queries on these fields. See [4]Logical Schema of
   Messages for more information.
