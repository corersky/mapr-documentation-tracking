Stream Topics

   Topics are created in streams and contain logical collections of
   messages. These collections of messages are published to partitions in
   the topic.
   Using MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka with MapR Filesystem and MapR
   Database in the MapR Converged Data Platform, enables organizations to
   create a centralized, secure data lake that unifies files, database
   tables, and message topics.
   Note: Topics inherit security permissions, time-to-live data retention,
   and data compression policies at the stream-level.

   You can design topic usage in a variety of ways. For example, you might
   have an application that monitors the logs for mission-critical
   software. Your monitoring application could send informational messages
   to a topic named info, warning messages to a topic named warnings, and
   error messages to a topic named errors. Different downstream
   applications might monitor each topic.
   You can manage topics for different scenarios:
     * Set security policies that apply all of the topics in that stream.
       Security policies are set at the stream-level. See [1]Stream
       Security for more information.
     * Set a default number of partitions for each new topic that is
       created in the stream. The default number partitions is set at the
       stream-level, however, individual topics can override the default.
       See [2]Topic Partitions for more information.
     * Set a time-to-live for messages in every topic in the stream. Every
       message in every topic in a stream expires after a duration of
       time, unless you set the time-to-live to 0, meaning messages never
       expire. Time-to-live is set at the stream-level. See
       [3]Time-to-Live for Messages for more information.

Restrictions

     * After a topic is created in a stream, it is not possible to move
       that topic to a different stream.
       For example, suppose you create the topic
       structural_integrity_sensors_us_western_region, one of a number of
       topics that collect data from sensors that keep watch over various
       measurements for bridges, buildings, and other structures. However,
       you've mistakenly created the topic in the stream
       ventilation_systems instead of the stream
       structural_integrity_sensors.
       Remember: There is no command that will move a topic from its
       current stream to a different stream.
       To rectify the mistake:
          + You must delete the topic and recreate it in the other stream.
          + Any producers that published messages to the topic and any
            consumers that read messages from the topic must be modified
            to point to the new location of the topic. This is because
            producers and consumers refer to topics with a combination of
            stream name and topic name.
     * Only the following characters are allowed for stream topic names:
          + Alphanumeric characters
          + Period, underscore, and dash
     * When producing or consuming stream topic messages, you must specify
       the stream's path and name along with the topic name in the
       following manner:
/<stream name>:<topic name>
       Note: If a topic is specified but the stream's path and name is
       not, depending on the application's programming language, you might
       get an error or nothing. If nothing happens and you are using Java,
       the assumption is that you are publishing to Apache Kafka.
