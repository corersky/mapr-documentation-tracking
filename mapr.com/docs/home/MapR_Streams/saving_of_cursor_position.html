Saving Cursor Position

   The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server keeps track of the
   messages that consumers in consumer groups have read by using cursors.

   There is one cursor per partition per consumer group. There are two
   different types of cursor: read cursors and committed cursors.

   A consumer's read cursor is the offset of the most recent message that
   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka has sent to a consumer from a
   partition.

   Consumers that are part of a consumer group can save the current
   position of their read cursor. Consumers can do this either
   automatically or manually. The saved cursor is called a committed
   cursor because it indicates that the consumer has processed all
   messages in a partition up to and including the one with this offset.
   There are two benefits to committing cursors:

   Failover on consumer failure
          One benefit is that if a consumer fails and MapR Event Store For
          Apache Kafka reassigns the consumerâ€™s partitions to other
          consumers in a group, those consumers can start reading from the
          next offset after the committed cursor in each of those
          partitions.

   Failover on cluster failure
          When you backup a stream by replicating it to another cluster,
          committed cursors are also replicated. If the main cluster
          fails, consumers that are redirected to the standby copy of a
          stream can start reading from the next offset after committed
          cursors.

   Read cursors
          A consumer's read cursor is the offset of the most recent
          message that MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka has sent to a
          consumer from a partition.

   Committed cursors
          Consumers that are part of a consumer group can save the current
          position of their read cursor. Consumers can do this either
          automatically or manually. The saved cursor is called a
          committed cursor because it indicates that the consumer has
          processed all messages in a partition up to and including the
          one with this offset.

   How often a consumer should commit depends on how much read duplication
   you are willing to tolerate. The more often a consumer commits, the
   less read duplication the consumer must contend with.

   The length of time since the failed consumer last committed determines
   (together with the rate at which messages are published to its
   partitions) how many messages are read a second time. For example,
   suppose that the auto-commit interval is five seconds. A consumer saves
   its commit cursor and then fails after three seconds. During those
   three seconds, the consumer's read cursor has continued to move through
   the messages. When its partitions are reassigned to other consumers in
   the group, those consumers will read three seconds of messages that the
   failed consumer already read.
   There are two different ways of committing cursors:

   Automatic commits
          Whether the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server commits the
          cursors for a consumer that is in a consumer group is determined
          by the enable.auto.commit configuration parameter. You can set
          it to true, which enables autocommit, or false. The default is
          true.
          The auto.commit.interval.ms configuration parameter determines
          the frequency of the commits in milliseconds. The default is
          value is 1000.

   Manual commits
          The Java API provides a method of committing cursors manually.
