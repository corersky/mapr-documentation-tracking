Consumer Failure and Recovery

   If a consumer that is not associated with a consumer-group ID fails,
   when it comes back online it can either start reading its partitions
   from the earliest offsets or from the latest offset. The choice is
   determined by the auto.offset.reset configuration parameter.

   If the consumer reads from the earliest offset in a partition, which is
   the offset of the message that has been in the partition longest
   without being deleted because of the expiration of the time-to-live
   interval for the stream, it might re-read a large number of messages
   before reading messages that were published after it failed.

   If the consumer reads from the latest offset in a partition, which is
   the offset of the most current message at the time the consumer
   requests new messages from MapR-ES, the consumer starts off up-to-date,
   but skips over the messages between its time of failure and the current
   time.
