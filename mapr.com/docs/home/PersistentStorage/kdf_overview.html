MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes Overview

   This page describes how the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes integrates
   with Kubernetes to provide persistent data for containers.

About the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes

   Most Pods in a Kubernetes environment should be portable, short-lived,
   and stateless. Traditionally, when a Pod is stopped or moved, the state
   of its containers could be lost. The MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes:
     * Provides long-lived, persistent storage for Pods and their
       containers.
     * Allows containers running in Kubernetes to use the MapR filesystem
       for all of their storage needs.
     * Allows secure storage of all container states in MapR-XD.

   The MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes consists of a set of Docker
   containers and their respective .yaml [3]configuration files for
   installation into Kubernetes. Once installed, both a Kubernetes
   [4]FlexVolume Driver for MaprFS and a Kubernetes [5]Dynamic Volume
   Provisioner are available for both static and dynamic provisioning of
   MapR storage.

Containers

   Containers are stand-alone, executable images of applications. They
   freeze all code needed to run an application, including an OS. Unlike
   VMs, containers run directly on an operating system without the need
   for a HyperVisor. Both Linux- and Windows-based applications can be
   packaged as containers. Containers represent an easy way to deploy
   applications in development and test environments. Using containers,
   developers can quickly create a development platform to test their
   code.

   Containers are ephemeral by nature and light-weight. They enable
   setting up compute clusters quickly. They also allow a cluster to be
   dismantled quickly. To accomplish this task, containers are designed to
   be ephemeral. That is, they are designed to be somewhat stateless.
   However, truly stateless containers would eliminate many classes of
   applications. It is therefore important to provide containers with
   persistent data independent of the container lifecycle. A natural
   solution is to have persistent storage (data) presented to the
   containers, just as persistent storage is presented today for VMs and
   in bare-metal environments.

Container Management

   Simple container solutions are somewhat limited when orchestrating
   multiple containers to solve complex business challenges. Managing
   containers for production is challenging. With many workloads
   transitioning to fully production-grade containers, cluster admins need
   something beyond a container engine like Docker. Several
   container-orchestration engines are now available to manage containers
   in production. Kubernetes is the most prominent example of these
   container-orchestration solutions.

Kubernetes Volume Drivers

   Kubernetes introduced the concept of FlexVolume drivers. FlexVolume
   drivers are intended to allow storage vendors to provide storage to
   containers managed by Kubernetes. The MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes
   leverages Kubernetes FlexVolume drivers. There are additional
   Kubernetes components and concepts you should also be aware of:
     * [6]Kubernetes Volumes: A Kubernetes volume is a Kubernetes-managed
       resource concept. Kubernetes Volumes are associated with
       [7]Kubernetes Pods. Kubernetes Volumes are different from MapR
       volumes. The lifecycle of a Kubernetes volume is tied to the
       lifecycle of a Kubernetes Pod, and the Kubernetes Volume is
       destroyed when the Pod is deleted.
     * [8]Kubernetes Persistent Volumes: As the name indicates, a
       Kubernetes Persistent Volume (PV) lifecycle is separate from the
       Pod that uses it. Persistent Volumes are referenced by Persistent
       Volume Claims (PVC), which are in turn referenced by Pods. Multiple
       Pods can claim a single PVC, but only a single PVC can bind with a
       PV.
     * [9]Storage Classes: A Storage Class is a way for administrators to
       advertise the different classes of storage they offer. For example,
       the admin can provide parameters in the storage class that define
       the frequency of snapshots or the number of mirrors associated with
       the storage. Storage Classes are used to dynamically provision a
       new storage volume for use by containers.
     * [10]MapR Volumes: The [11]MapR Glossary defines a MapR volume as a
       tree of files and directories grouped for the purpose of applying a
       policy or set of policies to all of them at once. To avoid
       confusion, this document uses the terms Kubernetes volume and MapR
       volume to distinguish between the different types of volumes.

Kubernetes and MapR Volumes

   In general, Kubernetes is not aware of MapR volumes. When static
   provisioning a MapR path, Kubernetes simply uses a MapR POSIX client to
   obtain a specific mount point within the MapR filesystem. When
   dynamically provisioning a new MapR volume for a container to use, the
   dynamic provisioner issues REST calls to the MapR REST server to create
   actual MapR volumes.
