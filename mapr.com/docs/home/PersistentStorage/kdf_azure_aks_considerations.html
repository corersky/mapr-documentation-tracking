Azure AKS Considerations

   Microsoft Azure turns on PodSecurityPolicies by default. This means you
   must create RBAC and PodSecurityPolicies for both the plug-in and any
   containers that call the plug-in.

   Here is an example of a PSP. It is recommended that you adapt this PSP
   to the security best practices of your organization:
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: mapr-kdf-psp
spec:
  volumes:
    - 'configMap'
    - 'emptyDir'
    - 'projected'
    - 'secret'
    - 'downwardAPI'
    - 'persistentVolumeClaim'
    - 'hostPath'
    - 'flexVolume'
  allowedHostPaths:
    - pathPrefix: "/opt"
    - pathPrefix: "/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/"
    - pathPrefix: "/etc/kubernetes"
    - pathPrefix: "/etc/localtime"
  allowedFlexVolumes:
    - driver: mapr.com/maprfs
  runAsUser:
    rule: 'RunAsAny'
  seLinux:
    rule: 'RunAsAny'
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: 'RunAsAny'
  fsGroup:
    rule: 'RunAsAny'

   Azure uses a non-standard FlexVolume path:
   /etc/kubernetes/volumeplugins. This path has already been changed in
   kdf-plugin-azure.yaml.

   You must set the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_LOCATION for Azure. You can find
   the correct value by connecting to your Azure cluster using the kubectl
   interface. Use the kubectl config view command, and find the server
   name and port for the current context.

   In Azure, the Kubelet process is running inside a hypercube container.
   The MapR plug-in must run inside that container. This means that the
   plug-in log is somewhat hidden. To view the plug-in log:
docker ps <to find the hyperkube container>
docker exec -it <hyperkube container ID> /bin/bash
cd /opt/mapr/logs
cat plugin plugin-k8s.log
