OpenShift Considerations

   For OpenShift environments, the installation steps are the same as
   described in [1]Installing the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes
   FlexVolume Driver. However, you must not apply the RBAC file. Instead
   run the following commands:
oc create -f kdf-openshift-sa.yaml
oc create -f kdf-openshift-scc.yaml
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user maprkdf-scc system:serviceaccount:mapr-system:mapr
kdf
oc create -f kdf-openshift-cr.yaml
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user mapr:kdf system:serviceaccount:mapr-syste
m:maprkdf

   All other installation steps are the same.
