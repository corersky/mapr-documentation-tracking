Configuring a Secret

   Kubernetes Secrets enable you to inject sensitive data into a Pod. For
   more information about Secrets, see [1]Secrets.

   The examples earlier in this section show how Secrets can be used in
   static and dynamic provisioning. Secrets are not by themselves secure.
   For more information about security and Secrets, see [2]Security
   Properties. Specifically, it is important to turn on encryption at rest
   for Secrets. See [3]Encrypting Secret Data at Rest.

   During installation of the plug-in, the Kubernetes token that was moved
   into the Pod is written to the host node so that the FlexVolume plugin
   can query a Secret to pull the ticket for mounting. This Kubernetes
   token is sensitive and should be protected. The token is placed in
   /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount.

REST Secrets

   For dynamic provisioning, you must use a Secret to pass the user name
   and password of a MapR user to the provisioner. This user must have
   privileges to create and delete a MapR volume. The credentials allow
   the provisioner to make REST calls to the MapR webserver. Secrets are
   protected by the Kubernetes [4]RBAC.
   Here is an example of a configuration file for a Kubernetes Secret:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: your-volumeadmin-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  MAPR_CLUSTER_USER: cm9vdA==
  MAPR_CLUSTER_PASSWORD: bwFwcg==

   The following table describes the fields in the Secret example. For
   more information, see [5]Secrets in the Kubernetes documentation.
   Parameter Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version.
   kind The type of object being created.
   name A string to identify the Secret.
   type The type of Secret being created. For type Opaque, clients must
   treat these values as opaque and pass them unmodified back to the
   server.
   MAPR_CLUSTER_USER The base64 representation of a MapR user that has the
   ability to create and delete MapR volumes.
   MAPR_CLUSTER_PASSWORD The base64 representation of the password for the
   user defined by the MAPR_CLUSTER_USER parameter.
   To create the Secret:
    1. Convert sensitive data, such as a MapR user name and password to a
       base64 representation. See [6]Converting a String to Base64.
    2. Create the Secret:
kubectl create -f <secret-name>.yaml
    3. Create a Pod that has access to the Secret data through a
       Kubernetes volume. See [7]Example: Mounting a PersistentVolume for
       Dynamic Provisioning.

Ticket Secrets

   The following example shows a ticket Secret:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mapr-ticket-secret
  namespace: mapr-examples
type: Opaque
data:
  CONTAINER_TICKET: CHANGETHIS!

   The following table describes the CONTAINER_TICKET field in the ticket
   Secret example.
   Parameter Notes
   CONTAINER_TICKET Base64-encoded ticket value. See [8]Converting a
   String to Base64.
