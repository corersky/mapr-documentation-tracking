Best Practices for Using Tickets

   When using secure MapR clusters with the MapR Data Fabric for
   Kubernetes, you must generate tickets for your containers. Here are
   some best practices:
     * Create a different user for each container.
     * Use long-lived service tickets to avoid frequent renewals. If you
       refresh or update a ticket, you will need to restart your
       containers.
     * If you use an impersonation ticket, it is CRITICAL that you use
       security contexts in the Pod definitions to avoid a misbehaving
       container impersonating all user IDs.
     * Match the security context runAsUser: ID and fsGroup: group to the
       ID or group used to create the ticket.

   Here is an example of a Pod spec that specifies a security context:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-secure
  namespace: mapr-examples
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup: 2000
