Configuring a Secret

   Kubernetes Secrets enable you to inject sensitive data into a Pod. For
   more information about Secrets, see [1]Secrets.

   The examples in this section show how Secrets can be used in static and
   dynamic provisioning. Secrets are not by themselves secure. For more
   information about security and Secrets, see [2]Security Properties.
   Specifically, it is important to turn on encryption at rest for
   Secrets. See [3]Encrypting Secret Data at Rest.

   During installation of the Driver, the Kubernetes token that was moved
   into the Pod is written to the host node so that the plugin can query a
   Secret to pull the ticket for mounting. This Kubernetes token is
   sensitive and should be protected. The token is placed in
   /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount.
   Here is an example of a configuration file for a Kubernetes Secret:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mapr-provisioner-secrets
  namespace: test-driver
type: Opaque
data:
  ...

   The following table describes the fields in the sample Secret file. For
   more information, see [4]Secrets in the Kubernetes documentation.
   Parameter Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version.
   kind The type of object being created.
   name A string to identify the Secret.
   type The type of Secret being created. For type Opaque, clients must
   treat these values as opaque and pass them unmodified back to the
   server.

   REST Secrets
          For dynamic provisioning, you must use a Secret to pass the user
          name and password of a MapR user to the provisioner. This user
          must have privileges to create and delete a MapR volume. The
          credentials allow the provisioner to make REST calls to the MapR
          webserver. Secrets are protected by the Kubernetes [5]RBAC.

          The following example shows a REST secret in the Secret file:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mapr-provisioner-secrets
  namespace: test-driver
type: Opaque
data:
 MAPR_CLUSTER_USER: cm9vdA==
  MAPR_CLUSTER_PASSWORD: bWFwcg==

          The following table describes the REST secret fields in the REST
          Secret example.

   Parameter Notes
   MAPR_CLUSTER_USER The base64 representation of a MapR user that has the
   ability to create and delete MapR volumes. See [6]Converting a String
   to Base64.
   MAPR_CLUSTER_PASSWORD The base64 representation of the password for the
   user defined by the MAPR_CLUSTER_USER parameter. See [7]Converting a
   String to Base64.

   Ticket Secrets
          For static and dynamic provisioning, you must specify a Secret,
          which is the base64 representation of the MapR ticket, to enable
          the POSIX client to communicate with a secure MapR cluster. The
          ticket for the POSIX client can be generated on the MapR cluster
          using the [8]maprlogin utility.

          The following example shows a ticket Secret:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mapr-ticket-secret
  namespace: mapr-examples
type: Opaque
data:
  CONTAINER_TICKET: CHANGETHIS!

          The following table describes the CONTAINER_TICKET field in the
          ticket Secret example.

   Parameter Notes
   CONTAINER_TICKET Base64-encoded ticket value. See [9]Converting a
   String to Base64.

   To create the Secret:
    1. Run the following command to create the Secret file:
kubectl create -f <secret-file-name>.yaml
    2. Convert sensitive data, such as a MapR user name and password, to a
       base64 representation.
       See [10]Converting a String to Base64.
    3. Add the base64 representation of sensitive data in the Secret file.
       See [11]REST Secrets and [12]Ticket Secrets for more information on
       the format of the Secret files.
    4. Deploy the secret on the Pod by running the following command:
kubectl apply -f <secret-file-name>.yaml
