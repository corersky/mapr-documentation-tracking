Enabling the Platinum Posix Client for MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes
FlexVolume Driver

   When you install the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes FlexVolume Driver,
   the Basic FUSE-based POSIX client package is installed on all nodes by
   default. The FlexVolume Driver also supports the use of the Platinum
   FUSE-based POSIX client. For a comparison of the two POSIX client
   packages, see [1]Preparing for Installation.

   To install the Platinum POSIX client, include the platinum parameter in
   your Pod spec. For example:
options:
cluster: "cluster2"
platinum: "true"
cldbHosts: "10.10.102.96"
