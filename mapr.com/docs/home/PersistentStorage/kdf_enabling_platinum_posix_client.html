Enabling the Platinum Posix Client

   When you install the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes, the Basic POSIX
   client package is installed on all nodes by default. The MapR Data
   Fabric for Kubernetes also supports the use of the Platinum POSIX
   client. For a comparison of the two POSIX client packages, see
   [1]Preparing for Installation.

   To install the Platinum POSIX client, include the platinum parameter in
   your Pod spec. For example:
options:
cluster: "cluster2"
platinum: "true"
cldbHosts: "10.10.102.96"
