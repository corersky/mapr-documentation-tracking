Before You Begin

   Before configuration, be sure to review the following notes about
   supported and unsupported features and parameters:

MapR Parameters for Dynamic Provisioning

   In dynamic provisioning, you can specify MapR parameters for the MapR
   volume to be created. For a list of the MapR parameters that you can
   use, see [1]volume create. Note these considerations for using the MapR
   parameters:
     * Volume attributes must be represented as a string (enclosed within
       quotations). Using an integer or boolean is not supported. In the
       following example, the aetype attribute will generate an error
       because the value (1) is not enclosed in quotations.
namePrefix: "pv"
mountPrefix: "/pv"
type: "rw"
advisoryquota: "100M"
aetype: 1
     * The following MapR parameters are ignored because they are
       redundant or not supported in the Kubernetes implementation:
          + mount
          + quota*
          + createparent
          + path
          + name

   *Specifying resources: requests: storage in a PersistentVolumeClaim
   (PVC) (see [2]Example: Mounting a PersistentVolume for Static
   Provisioning Using the FlexVolume Driver) makes it unnecessary to set
   the MapR quota parameter.

Kubernetes Access Modes

   Kubernetes access modes control how a PersistentVolume (PV) is mounted
   on the host. [3]Access modes can be specified on both PVs and PVCs.
   Only Volumes with a matching Access Mode will be bound to a PVC.
   Unfortunately, beyond the PVC/PV binding behavior, PVs using FlexVolume
   drivers ignore these access modes in the current version of Kubernetes.
   All access modes will work with the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes.
   However, they will appear the same. This means the ROX mode will not
   make the volume read only. If you want read-only behavior, specify
   readOnly: in the FlexVolume driver flags.

PersistentVolumeClaim Protection

   PVC protection is a Kubernetes 1.9 alpha feature that restricts the
   user from deleting a PVC while it is being used by an active Pod. Alpha
   features are not tested for use with the volume plug-in and
   provisioner. However, without PVC protection, you should not delete a
   PVC that is still attached to Pods. If you have not turned on PVC
   protection, ensure that you do not delete PVCâ€™s that are in use. In the
   current release of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes, deleting a PVC
   causes undefined behavior.

Reclaim Policy

   The Kubernetes reclaimPolicy parameter controls what happens to a
   PersistentVolume if the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted.
   The Recycle Reclaim Policy is not supported by Kubernetes FlexVolume
   Drivers, so it cannot be used with KDF. The Retain Policy is currently
   broken in Kubernetes 1.9 StoragePolicies but not in static
   PersistentVolumes. The MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes has a workaround
   that allows Retain policy on dynamically provisioned volumes by passing
   the reclaimPolicy: in the parameters rather than in the standard place
   that FlexVolumes ignore. You can specify the reclaim policy normally
   when you configure a persistent volume.
   The following table shows the supported values for the reclaim policy:
   Reclaim Policy Value Description Support
   Delete (default value) The PersistentVolume and the MapR volume are
   deleted when the user deletes the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim.
   Supported
   Retain The PersistentVolume and the MapR volume are not deleted when
   the user deletes the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim. Supported*
   Recycle Performs a basic scrub on a PersistentVolume and makes it
   available for a new PersistentVolumeClaim. Not Supported by Kubernetes
   Flexvolumes

   *Not supported for dynamic provision without a workaround.

   For more information about the reclaim policy, see [4]Change the
   Reclaim Policy of a PersistentVolume.

Kubernetes Mount Options

   The Kubernetes mountOptions parameter is not supported for use with the
   MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes because it is not supported for use
   with the FlexVolume plug-in.
