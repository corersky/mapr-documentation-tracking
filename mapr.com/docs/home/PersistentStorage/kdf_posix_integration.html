POSIX Integration and Licensing

   The MapR POSIX client provides fast-data access between the container
   and the MapR filesystem. The POSIX client is installed onto all
   Kubernetes worker nodes when you install the volume plug-in through its
   .yaml configuration file.

   For static provisioning, the volume plug-in uses the POSIX client to
   mount the MapR filesystem. The provisioner does not use the POSIX
   client to provision volumes, but a provisioned volume is mounted
   through POSIX when the plug-in is called after PV creation.

Support for Basic and Platinum Licenses

   By default, the product includes the Basic POSIX client package, but
   you can enable the Platinum license, if needed. See [1]Enabling the
   Platinum Posix Client. Only the POSIX client is supported. NFSv3 is not
   currently supported.

   While the Platinum POSIX client offers up to five times better
   performance than the Basic POSIX client, resource utilization is
   significantly higher for the Platinum client. For a comparison of the
   Basic and Platinum packages, see [2]Preparing for Installation.

Mounting Multiple MapR Paths

   It is inefficient in both host resources and licenses to mount multiple
   MapR paths in the same Pod. Multiple mount points will consume
   additional resources on the Kubernetes host node. A more
   resource-efficient strategy is to use subpaths. See [3]Using subpaths
   in the Kubernetes documentation.
