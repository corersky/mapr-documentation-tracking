Example: Mounting a PersistentVolume for Static Provisioning Using the
FlexVolume Driver

   For static provisioning, configuring a PersistentVolume has some
   advantages over annotating Kubernetes volume information in a Pod spec:
     * The configuration file can be shared for use by multiple Pod specs.
     * The configuration file enables the PersistentVolume to be mounted
       and available even when the Pod spec that references it is removed.

   For example: A marketing volume exists in the MapR filesystem under the
   path /Departments/Marketing. An administrator wants to statically
   provision this volume and make it available to multiple users. It is
   critical that data access is as fast as possible. To make this work,
   the administrator must:
    1. Create a PersistentVolume (PV).
    2. Set the AccessMode of the PV to ReadWriteOnce.
    3. Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) spec.
    4. Set the AccessMode of the PVC to ReadWriteOnce.
    5. Create the Pod spec.
    6. Generate a MapR service ticket, and set the flexVolume securityType
       parameter to secure. For information about generating a service
       ticket, see [1]Generating a Service Ticket.
    7. Configure a Ticket Secret, and include the base64-encoded contents
       of the ticket file in the Ticket Secret. See [2]Configuring a
       Secret.
    8. Set the runAsUser and the fsGroup parameters to the UID and GID of
       the user that created the ticket.
    9. Set the platinum parameter in the Pod spec to platinum: "true". See
       [3]Enabling the Platinum Posix Client for MapR Data Fabric for
       Kubernetes FlexVolume Driver.
   10. Point the volumePath in the flexVolume setting to the desired MapR
       path.
   11. Fill in the cldbHosts and cluster information.

   PersistentVolume (PV)
   Parameter Notes
   Capacity Specifies how big the allocated storage should be. This value
   is not validated against the MapR quota or advisory quota. It is up to
   the person creating the PV to specify this value accurately.
   accessModes How the PersistentVolume is mounted on the host. All modes
   work the same. The example uses ReadWriteOnce. Note that ReadOnlyMany
   does not mount read-only. (To implement a read-only mount, use the
   Flexvolume flag for readOnly, as shown in [4]Example: Statically
   Provisioning a MapR Volume Using the FlexVolume Plug-in.) It's
   important that the PV and PVC modes are the same so that they can bind.
   For more information, see [5]Access Modes.
   persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy Specifies what happens to the volume when
   it is released by its claim. The Retain value keeps the PVC around for
   manual cleanup. Delete deletes the PV from Kubernetes.
   Note: If this volume was created using dynamic provisioning, Delete
   causes the underlying volume to be deleted. Recycle is not supported by
   Kubernetes FlexVolumes. For more information, see [6]Reclaiming.
   claimRef Specifies a default PVC to bind to. If unspecified, the PV
   selected for a PVC is randomly allocated based on the access mode and
   provides at least as much storage capacity as requested by the PVC.
   flexVolume: driver The MapR FlexVolume driver being used. Call it by
   specifying driver: mapr.com/maprfs.
   platinum If set to platinum: "true", the POSIX client uses the platinum
   driver for better performance. Note that the platinum driver consumes
   more host resources and MapR Platinum licenses.
   cluster The MapR cluster name.
   cldbHosts The hostname or IP addresses of the CLDB hosts for the MapR
   cluster. You must provide at least one CLDB host. For fault-tolerance,
   providing multiple CLDB hosts is recommended. To specify multiple
   hosts, separate each name or IP address by a space.
   volumePath The mount point within the MapR filesystem. This parameter
   specifies an existing MapR path. For example, you can specify the root
   volume as "/", providing access to the entire filesystem.
   securityType A parameter that indicates whether MapR tickets are used
   or not used. If MapR tickets are used, specify secure. Otherwise,
   specify unsecure.
   ticketSecretName The name of the Ticket Secret that contains the ticket
   to use when mounting to the MapR cluster. See [7]Configuring a Secret.
   ticketSecretNamespace The namespace that contains the Ticket Secret.
   Use the same namespace as the namespace used by the Pod.

   Pod
   Parameter Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version for the Pod spec.
   kind The kind of object being created. The example uses a naked Pod for
   clarity. Generally, it is better to use a Deployment, DaemonSet, or
   StatefulSet for high availability and ease of upgrade.
   metadata: name The Pod name.
   metadata: namespace The namespace in which the Pod runs.
   volumeMounts: mountPath A directory inside the container that is
   designated as the mount path.
   volumeMounts: name A name that you assign to the Kubernetes
   volumeMounts resource. This value should match Volumes: name.
   Volumes: name A string to identify the name of the Kubernetes volumes
   resource. This value should match volumeMounts: name.

   PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
   Parameter Notes
   AccessMode How the requested PersistentVolume is mounted on the host.
   All modes work the same. The example uses ReadWriteOnce. Note that
   ReadOnlyMany does not mount read-only. (To implement a read-only mount,
   use the Flexvolume flag for readOnly, as shown in [8]Example:
   Statically Provisioning a MapR Volume Using the FlexVolume Plug-in.)
   It's important that the PV and PVC modes are the same so that they can
   bind. For more information, see [9]Access Modes.

   Secret
   Parameter Notes
   metadata: name The name of the Ticket Secret. See [10]Configuring a
   Secret
   metadata: namespace The namespace in which the Ticket Secret runs.
   CONTAINER_TICKET The contents of the MapR ticket encoded in base64. If
   you specified secure for the securityType, you must provide the ticket.
   To encode the ticket, see [11]Converting a String to Base64. You may
   remove the ticket if the MapR cluster is not secure.
