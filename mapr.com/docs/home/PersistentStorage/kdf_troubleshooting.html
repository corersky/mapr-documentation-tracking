Troubleshooting the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes

   This section describes how to resolve common problems you might
   encounter when using the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes.

Unable to Access MapR Filesystem

   Problem
          Storage is not mounted and no errors are generated in the plugin
          or provisioner [1]logs.

   Possible Cause
          The fusermount symlink might be broken.

   Resolution
          If the symlink points to a location other than
          /opt/mapr/k8s/bin/fusermount, unlink it using the following
          command from the command line on the host:

unlink /bin/fusermount

          Then re-create the Kubernetes Pod.

Pod Container Stuck in Container Creation State During Installation

   Problem
          During installation, the Pod container can become stuck in the
          container creation state on a node, and the/opt/mapr/k8s
          directory is not created. As a result, the plug-in does not get
          copied to the node.

   Possible Cause
          Unknown.

   Resolution
          Check the installation [2]logs for an indication that the
          installation is not completed or the /opt/mapr/k8s directory is
          not created. Restart the kubelet service in the node:

systemctl restart kubelet
