Example: Statically Provisioning a MapR Volume Using the FlexVolume Plug-in

   You can designate a MapR volume for use with Kubernetes by specifying
   the MapR FlexVolume parameters directly inside the Pod spec. In the Pod
   spec, you define a Kubernetes volume and add the MapR FlexVolume
   information to it. You can supply path information by using the
   volumePath parameter. The Kubernetes volume is only as persistent as
   the Pod. By defining the volume this way, when the Pod is removed, the
   Kubernetes volume is also immediately unmounted and removed. This
   approach to static provisioning is most appropriate when you want to
   get up and running quickly or when you want the Pod and Kubernetes
   volume lifecycle to be the same.
   For example, a developer wants to get her application container up and
   running quickly with MapR. She already has a MapR path that she wants
   to use for the application. She only needs the data accessible to read.
   To make this work, she must:
    1. Generate a MapR service ticket, and set the securityType parameter
       in the Pod spec to secure. See [1]Generating a Service Ticket.
    2. Configure a Ticket Secret, and include the base64-encoded contents
       of the ticket file in the Ticket Secret. See [2]Configuring a
       Secret.
    3. Set the runAsUser and the fsGroup parameters to the UID and GID of
       the user that created the ticket.
    4. Point the volumePath in the flexVolume setting to the desired path,
       and fill in the cldbHosts and cluster information.

   Note: The following example works for on-premise deployments. For GKE
   and AWS deployments, you must set a default StorageClass to the maprfs
   StorageClass. If a default StorageClass is not provided for GKE and AWS
   deployments, the volume is created using your default StorageClass,
   which might not be a good fit. For information about changing the
   default StorageClass, see [3]Change the default StorageClass.

   The following tables describe the parameters in the example:

   Pod
   Parameter Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version for the Pod spec.
   kind The kind of object being created. For clarity, the example uses a
   naked Pod. Generally, it is better to use a Deployment, DaemonSet, or
   StatefulSet for high availability (HA) and ease of upgrade.
   metadata: name The Pod name.
   metadata: namespace The namespace in which the Pod runs.
   securityContext: runAsUser The user ID to run the container under. This
   user ID must be the same as the user ID for which the ticket was
   generated.
   securityContext: fsGroup The group ID to run the container under. This
   group ID must be the same as the group ID of the user for which the
   ticket was generated.
   volumeMounts: mountPath A directory inside the container that is
   designated as the mount path.
   volumeMounts: name A name that you assign to the Kubernetes
   volumeMounts resource. Matches with Volumes: name.
   Volumes: name A string to identify the name of the Kubernetes volumes
   resource. Matches with volumeMounts: name.
   flexVolume: driver The MapR FlexVolume driver being used. Call it using
   this driver: mapr.com/maprfs.
   flexVolume: readOnly Specifies that the FlexVolume driver should tell
   the MapR POSIX Client to mount the volume with the read-only flag.
   volumePath The mount point within the MapR filesystem. This parameter
   specifies an existing MapR path. For example, you can specify the root
   volume as "/", providing access to the entire filesystem.
   cluster The MapR cluster name.
   cldbHosts The DNS names or IP addresses of the CLDB hosts for the MapR
   cluster. You must provide at least one CLDB host. For fault-tolerance,
   providing multiple CLDB hosts is recommended. To specify multiple
   hosts, separate each name or IP address by a space.
   securityType A parameter that indicates whether MapR tickets are used
   or not used. If MapR tickets are used, specify secure. Otherwise,
   specify unsecure.
   ticketSecretName The name of the Secret that contains the ticket to use
   when mounting to the MapR cluster. See [4]Configuring a Secret.
   ticketSecretNamespace The namespace that contains the Secret. See
   [5]Configuring a Secret

   Secret
   Parameter Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version.
   kind The type of object being created.
   name A string to identify the Secret.
   namespace The namespace in which the Secret runs.
   type The type of Secret being created. For type Opaque, clients must
   treat these values as opaque and pass them unmodified back to the
   server.
   CONTAINER_TICKET The contents of the MapR ticket encoded in base64. If
   you specified secure for the securityType, you must provide the ticket.
   To encode the ticket, see [6]Converting a String to Base64. You may
   remove the ticket if the MapR cluster is not secure.
