Accessing the Zeppelin Docker Image

   To access a container image through docker, you specify the image name
   and a tag. In the case of the MapR Data Science Refinery, the tag
   specifies the operating system of the running container. This operating
   system does not need to match your host operating system.

   The image name and available tags for the latest release are the
   following:
   Image Name Operating System Version of Running Container Tag
   maprtech/data-science-refinery CentOS 7 v1.2_6.0.1_5.0.0_centos7
   Ubuntu 16 v1.2_6.0.1_5.0.0_ubuntu16

   For a complete list of all available tags, see
   [1]https://hub.docker.com/r/maprtech/data-science-refinery/tags/.
    1. Download the docker image, referencing the image name and tag. The
       following downloads the image for CentOS:
docker pull maprtech/data-science-refinery:v1.2_6.0.1_5.0.0_centos7
       Note: You should choose the image OS that matches the OS running in
       your MapR cluster. This minimizes version differences in the Python
       and R libraries running in your container vs your MapR cluster.
    2. Verify that you have downloaded the docker image by listing the
       docker images on your machine:
docker images
