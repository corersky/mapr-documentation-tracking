Running the Zeppelin Container

   To run the Apache Zeppelin container, you must access the Zeppelin
   Docker image from MapRâ€™s public repository, run the Docker image, and
   access the deployed container from your web browser. From your browser,
   you can create Zeppelin notebooks.
   To pull and run the Docker image, you must first install Docker on the
   host where you want to run the container. You can download the software
   from [1]https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/.
   Docker is a tool that you use to package an application and its
   dependencies into a virtual container. You can deploy and run the
   container on any node. MapR uses this technology to package Apache
   Zeppelin with all software you need to integrate with various engines.
   After you deploy the container, all software and services used by
   Zeppelin are started and ready for you to use.
   Important: After installing Docker, you must configure it with at least
   3.5 GB of memory. Otherwise, you may not be able to start the Zeppelin
   container or may encounter log in problems.

   See [2]https://docs.docker.com/ for additional information about Docker
   and [3]https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/ for information about
   running Docker images from cloud-based repositories.
