Installing Custom Packages for PySpark

   You can install custom Python packages either by manually installing
   packages on each node in your MapR cluster or by using Conda. Using
   Conda allows you to perform the install from your Zeppelin host node
   without having to directly access your MapR cluster. The topics in this
   section describe the instructions for each method as well as
   instructions for Python 2 vs Python 3.

   You can run only version of Python in your Zeppelin notebook.
   Important: MapR supports the Python libraries included in the Zeppelin
   container, but does not support the libraries in custom Python
   packages. You should use Python versions that match the versions
   installed on your MapR cluster nodes. Choosing a [1]Zeppelin Docker
   image OS that matches the OS running in your MapR cluster minimizes
   library version differences.
