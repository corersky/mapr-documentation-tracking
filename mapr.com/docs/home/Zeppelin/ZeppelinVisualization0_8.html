Using Visualization Packages in Zeppelin

   Apache Zeppelin supports the Helium framework. Using visualization
   packages, you can view your data through area charts, bar charts,
   scatter charts, and other displays. To use a visualization package, you
   must enable it through the Helium repository browser in the Zeppelin
   UI. Like Zeppelin interpreters, Helium is automatically installed in
   your Zeppelin container.
   The example in this section assumes that you are using Zeppelin 0.8.0
   and are enabling the ultimate-pie-chart package. Zeppelin 0.8.0 is
   supported starting in MapR Data Science Refinery 1.3. If you are using
   an earlier release of MapR Data Science Refinery, see earlier versions
   of the documentation for instructions.
   Important: The Apache Community provides and supports the visualization
   packages available through the Helium repository browser. MapR does not
   provide support for these packages.

   Follow these steps to enable a package:
    1. Open the Helium repository browser by selecting the Helium tab in
       the main menu of the Zeppelin UI:

    2. Locate your package, click Enable, and then click OK in the popup
       window:

       The time it takes to enable a package depends on your internet
       connection speed.

   After enabling the package and refreshing your browser to reload
   notebook content, you can use the package. The following shows output
   that uses the ultimate-pie-chart package:
