Configuring the JDBC Interpreter for Apache Drill and Apache Hive

   Apache Zeppelin on MapR includes custom JDBC interpreters for Apache
   Drill and Apache Hive. Fields in each interpreter are prepopulated, but
   you need to customize them for your environment.

   In particular, you must modify the JDBC URL, as described in the
   following sections.

Drill JDBC

   You must specify the Apache Drill JDBC URL in the default.url property:

   The following is an example of a URL when MapR-SASL is enabled:
jdbc:drill:drillbit=node1:31010;auth=maprsasl

   If MapR-SASL is not enabled, the URL is the following:
jdbc:drill:drillbit=node1:31010

   For non-secure clusters, default.user is prepopulated with the user
   running the container (MAPR_CONTAINER_USER). You can modify this
   property and default.password, as needed. Zeppelin submits your Drill
   queries using this user name and password (if specified).

   For secure clusters, Zeppelin always submits Drill queries using the
   user name and password from your MapR ticket. You do not need to modify
   the default.user and default.password properties.

Hive JDBC

   You must specify the Apache Hive JDBC URL in the default.url property:

   The following is an example of a URL when MapR-SASL is enabled:
jdbc:hive2://node2:10000/default;auth=maprsasl

   If MapR-SASL is not enabled, the URL is the following:
jdbc:hive2://node2:10000/default
