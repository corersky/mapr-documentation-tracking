Exposing MapR Data Science Refinery as a Service in Kubernetes

   You can expose MapR Data Science Refinery as a Kubernetes service. For
   example, if you run the service in a cloud Kubernetes deployment, you
   can expose it as a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service. This topic provides
   a sample that shows you how to do this. It also discusses the
   alternative where you are running in a non-cloud Kubernetes deployment.

   The following sample YAML file exposes a LoadBalancer service:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dsr-web-svc
  namespace: dsr-ns
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - { name: dsr-ui, port: 9995, nodePort: 32000 }

  selector:
    app: dsr-app

   If you are running in a cloud Kubernetes deployment, run the following
   command to retrieve the external IP of the LoadBalancer service:
kubectl get service -n dsr-ns

   Use the value in the EXTERNAL-IP column as the IP to connect to the
   MapR Data Science Refinery UI:
https://<EXTERNAL-IP>:9995

   If you are running in a non-cloud Kubernetes deployment, the
   EXTERNAL-IP column returns <pending>, due to unavailability of a
   LoadBalancer service. You can still connect to the MapR Data Science
   Refinery UI by using the IP of any Kubernetes worker node and the
   nodePort specified in your YAML file:
https://<k8s-worker-ip>:32000
