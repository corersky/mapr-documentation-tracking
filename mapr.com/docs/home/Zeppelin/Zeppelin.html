Zeppelin on MapR

   The MapR Data Science Refinery includes a preconfigured Apache Zeppelin
   notebook, packaged as a Docker container. Apache Zeppelin is an open
   source web-based data science notebook. You can use it with MapR
   components to conduct data discovery, ETL, machine learning, and data
   visualization.

   You can run the Zeppelin container either on your laptop or on MapR
   edge nodes. Out of box, the Zeppelin container image is integrated with
   open source data processing engines like Apache Spark, Apache Drill,
   and Apache Hive, as well as with native MapR engines (MapR Filesystem,
   MapR Database, and MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka). Using the
   notebook simply requires running the Docker image and connecting to the
   container through your browser.

   Zeppelin provides the following benefits for your data engineering and
   data science use cases:
     * An interactive development environment for writing, testing, and
       sharing data processing code snippets
     * The ability to run the notebooks in a local client environment,
       such as on a laptop
     * Support for a variety of interpreters for integrating with
       different backend components
     * Support for extensible visualization libraries

   The Zeppelin notebook included with the Data Science Refinery provides
   additional benefits:
     * A small footprint, pre-built, certified data science container that
       is easy to deploy and run
     * An isolated environment where you can experiment with libraries and
       packages without affecting other users' work
     * Secure authentication at the container level across a secure Web
       connection
     * Preconfigured JDBC interpreters for accessing query engines like
       [1]Apache Drill and [2]Apache Hive
     * The [3]MapR FUSE-Based POSIX Client, which you need to access
       [4]MapR Filesystem using shell commands
     * All client side services that you need to submit [5]Apache Spark
       jobs, including jobs that access [6]MapR Event Store For Apache
       Kafka
     * [7]MapR connectors, which you need to access [8]MapR Database (both
       binary and JSON tables)

   See [9]Zeppelin Release Notes for release specific information.

   [10]open source documentation.
