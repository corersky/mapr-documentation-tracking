Sharing Zeppelin Notebook Content

   By default, Zeppelin stores notebooks in the local file system in your
   container. An alternative is to store them in MapR Filesystem. This
   allows you to share the notebooks with other users.

   To store notebooks in MapR Filesystem, see [1]Notebook Storage.

   For information about other available storage options, see
   [2]https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/storage/storage.html.
