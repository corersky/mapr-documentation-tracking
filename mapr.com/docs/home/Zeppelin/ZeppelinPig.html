Running Pig Scripts in Zeppelin

   This section contains a sample of an Apache Pig script that you can run
   in your Apache Zeppelin notebook.
   This example reads the contents of your password file and outputs the
   first field in the file: the user name.
    1. Using the shell interpreter, copy the password file to MapR
       Filesystem:
          + [1]POSIX
          + [2]Hadoop
       To use POSIX shell commands like cp, you must have a [3]MapR
       Filesystem mount point in your container. The example below assumes
       your mount point is /mapr and your cluster name is my.cluster.com:
%sh
cp /etc/passwd /mapr/my.cluster.com/user/mapruser1
%sh
hadoop fs -put /etc/passwd /user/mapruser1/
    2. Load the password file in Pig and output the first field in each
       line in the file:
%pig
A = load 'passwd' using PigStorage(':');
B = foreach A generate $0 as id;
dump B;

   There are other examples of [4]using Pig in the Zeppelin tutorial,
   including running Pig queries.
