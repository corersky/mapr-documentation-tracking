Accessing and Creating Notebooks in Zeppelin

    1. After the Apache Zeppelin Docker image is running, access the
       Zeppelin notebook in your browser by specifying the following URL:
https://localhost:9995
       This URL loads the Zeppelin notebookâ€™s home page. You must specify
       a secure URL.
       If the Docker image is running on a remote node, such as a MapR
       edge node, replace localhost with the host name or IP address of
       the remote node. If you specified a different port number in your
       docker run command, replace 9995 with your port number.
    2. Log in to Zeppelin using the user name and password you specified
       in your docker run command:

    3. Create your notebook:

       See [1]Understanding Zeppelin Interpreters for details on
       interpreters you can use.
