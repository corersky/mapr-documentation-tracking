Running MapR Data Science Refinery as a Deployment in Kubernetes

   This topic provides a sample YAML file that shows you how to run MapR
   Data Science Refinery as a Kubernetes Deployment. Doing so enables the
   Kubernetes deployment controller to spawn a new pod when a pod is
   killed or dies.

   To run MapR Data Science Refinery as a Kubernetes Deployment, include
   the following configuration settings in your YAML file:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dsr-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
          labels:
            app: dsr-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: dsr
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        image:  maprtech/data-science-refinery:v1.3_6.1.0_6.0.0_centos7

   The remainder of your YAML file is similar to a YAML file that
   specifies a Pod. The YAML file at [1]Running MapR Data Science Refinery
   as a Kubernetes Service is an example.
