Myriad

   Note: With the MapR 6.2 release, Myriad will be deprecated and no
   longer supported.

   Myriad enables the co-existence of Apache Hadoop and Apache Mesos on
   the same physical infrastructure. By running Hadoop YARN as a Mesos
   framework, YARN applications and Mesos frameworks can run side-by-side
   while dynamically sharing cluster resources. Resource allocation and
   management of Mesos services is supported by MapR Warden. The
   configure.sh script provides additional options for configuring Myriad.
   With Apache Myriad, you can:
     * Run your operational applications (including those running in
       Docker) side-by-side with your analytic applications.
     * Achieve Hadoop multi-tenancy by provisioning logical Hadoop
       clusters for each user or group.

Key Features

     * YARN running as a Mesos Framework, with resource manager and node
       managers running inside Mesos containers.
     * YARN clusters running on Mesos that can allocate resources in one
       of the following ways:
     * Static - Administrators can use an API or a GUI to add or remove
       node managers or auxiliary services like the JobHistoryServer.
     * Fine-grained - Administrators can provision thin node managers that
       are dynamically resized based on application demand.
     * High Availability (HA) and graceful restart of YARN daemons.
     * Ability to launch multiple YARN clusters on the same set of nodes.
     * Support for YARN FairScheduler and all functionality such as
       hierarchical queues with weights. Ability to deploy YARN Resource
       Manager using Marathon. This feature leverages Marathon's dynamic
       scheduling, process supervision, and integration with service
       discovery (Mesos-DNS).
     * Ability to run MapReduce version 2 and associated libraries such as
       Hive and Pig.
