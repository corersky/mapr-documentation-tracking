Use Myriad

   The Myriad environment is established by running an initial application
   for the Resource Manager. The initial application ID is established
   when you [1]configure Myriad with /opt/mapr/services/configure.sh with
   the Resource Manager property (-RM) and the value: <RM
   app-name>>.marathon.mesos. For example, if the value of Resource
   Manager property is rm.marathon.mesos:

   rm
          The ID given to the Resource Manager when launched using
          Marathon. Mesos-DNS constructs the Resource Manager hostname
          using the ID.

   marathon
          The Mesos framework.

   If you are using Marathon, launch Marathon, and run an initial Resource
   Manager application. See [2]Starting Resource Manager for more
   information.
   Note: The Resource Manager can not be managed by the maprcli nodes
   services command.
