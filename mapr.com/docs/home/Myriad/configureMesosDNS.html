Configuring Mesos-DNS

   After installing Mesos-DNS on its master node, configure Mesos-DNS by
   updating values in the config.json file on the node where Mesos-DNS is
   installed and update the /etc/resolv.conf file on every node in the
   cluster.
   Note: The Mesos-DNS package can be installed on any node that is
   designated as its master. For more information, see
   [1]https://mesosphere.github.io/mesos-dns/docs/
   Important: The first nameserver specified in the /etc/resolv.conf file
   must be the IP address where Mesos-DNS is installed. This is to prevent
   issues associated with slow interconnectivity.
   In the following example, 10.10.100.16 is the Mesos-DNS IP address:
vi /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver 10.10.100.16
nameserver 10.10.1.10
nameserver 12.250.1.3
