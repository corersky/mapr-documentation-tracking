Launching Myriad Services

   The Myriad services are launched automatically and accessed from their
   designated ports.

   Mesos master, Mesos slave, and Mesos Marathon services are launched
   automatically after configuration (running configure.sh). Myriad is
   launched once you run an initial Resource Manager, normally form the
   Marathon UI. In a browser, Mesos, Marathon, and Myriad are accessible
   (launched) from the following ports:

   CAPTION: Table 1. Ports Used

   Application Port
   Mesos Master UI http://<hostname>:5050
   Marathon UI http://<hostname>:8080
   Myriad UI http://<hostname>:8192
   Note: The Myriad UI is available once an initial Resource Manager is
   launched.
   Note: If you have multiple nodes in your cluster, Myriad may be started
   on any one of the nodes. To obtain the Myriad host, access the Mesos UI
   and check the Active Tasks > Hosts panel.
   MapR Control System (MCS UI) http://<hostname>:8443
   Note: If your environment has both Mesos Marathon and Spark installed
   on the same node, a conflict occurs because the default port for both
   is 8080. To resolve this conflict, change the port for one of the
   applications.
