Special Considerations for FUSE POSIX Patches

   Patches for some features, such as the FUSE POSIX client, can require
   post-installation steps.
   When you install a FUSE POSIX patch, a new and backup copy of the
   fuse.conf file are created in the /opt/mapr/conf directory. These files
   are called:
     * fuse.conf.new
     * fuse.conf.old

   You can find the new parameters in the fuse.conf.new file. If needed,
   you can copy the new parameters to your existing fuse.conf file and
   restart FUSE for the settings to take effect.

   For FUSE POSIX configuration information, see [1]Configuring the MapR
   FUSE-Based POSIX Client.
