Extending a Cluster by Adding Nodes

   This section describes how to add capacity to a MapR cluster by adding
   nodes.

   You add nodes to a cluster by using the web-based MapR Installer
   (version 1.6 or later) or MapR Installer Stanzas. The nodes are added
   to a pre-existing group online without disturbing the running cluster.
   You can add nodes to on-premise clusters or to cloud-based clusters.

   You can add multiple nodes to a group in the same operation, and you
   can add nodes to custom groups. You can also add the same node to
   multiple groups. The MapR Installer installs the new nodes with the
   same patch level as the existing nodes.
   Note: Before adding nodes, use the MapR Installer to ensure that your
   cluster uses three-digit MEPs. If your cluster uses two-digit MEPs,
   adding a node can result in a version mismatch between the cluster and
   the newly added node. To change from two-digit to three-digit MEPs you
   can perform an Incremental Install using the MapR Installer. For more
   information, see [1]Understanding Two-Digit and Three-Digit MEPs.

Restrictions

   Note these restrictions for using the Extend Cluster operation. When
   adding nodes:
     * The cluster must already be installed before nodes can be added.
     * You cannot add a node to a MASTER group, since these services can
       run only on one node.
     * If you add a node to a CONTROL group that has a CLDB, you must do a
       manual, rolling restart of the entire cluster.
     * If you add a node to a group that has OpenTSDB, you must add the
       same node to the group that contains AsyncHBase (currently, the
       MapR Installer does not check to ensure that this dependency is
       met).
     * You cannot add services.
     * You cannot change the MEP version or MapR Core version.
     * You cannot add new service groups.
     * New nodes are added automatically to the DEFAULT group.
     * A node added to a MapR secure cluster will be configured for
       security automatically. If the cluster is custom secure, you cannot
       use the MapR Installer. See [2]Customizing Security in MapR.

Before Adding Nodes

    1. Determine the group(s) to which new nodes will be added.
       You can add nodes to the following types of groups:
          + CLIENT
          + DATA
          + CONTROL
          + MULTI_MASTER
          + MONITORING_MASTER
       Note: If you add a node to a group containing a CLDB, you must
       restart all the nodes except for the new node. If you add a node to
       a group containing Zookeeper (but not CLDB), you must restart
       Zookeeper on all the Zookeeper nodes except for the new node. And
       you must restart the lead Zookeeper last.
       To gather information about groups, see [3]Getting Information
       About Services and Groups.
    2. Ensure that the node(s) to be added meet the installation
       prerequisites described in the [4]MapR Installer Prerequisites and
       Guidelines.

Adding Nodes Using the MapR Installer Web Interface

    1. Use a browser to connect to the cluster using the MapR Installer
       URL:
https://<Installer Node hostname/IPaddress>:9443
    2. On the status screen, click the Extend Cluster button. The MapR
       Installer displays the Extend Cluster screen showing the currently
       configured groups and services.
       Note: If the Extend Cluster button is not visible, you might need
       to clear your browser cache and refresh the browser page.
    3. Specify the nodes to be added:
          + On-Premise Cluster
            In the Additional Nodes column, specify the host name(s) or IP
            address(es) of the nodes to be added. If you are adding
            multiple nodes, you can specify an array. The following
            example adds perfnode132.perf.lab and perfnode133.perf.lab to
            the CONTROL group and perfnode132.perf.lab to the MULTI_MASTER
            group:
            [add_node_example.png]
          + Cloud-Based Cluster
            In the Additional Nodes column, specify the number of nodes to
            be added. You do not need to specify the host name or IP
            address. The following example adds a node to each of the
            CONTROL, DATA, and CLIENT groups:
            [add_node_example_cloud.png]
    4. Click Next. The MapR Installer checks the nodes to ensure that they
       are ready for installation and displays the Authentication screen.
    5. Enter your SSH password and other authentication information as
       needed, and click Next. The installer displays the Verify Nodes
       screen.
       Note: For a cloud-based cluster, the Authentication screen requests
       information that is specific to the type of cluster (AWS or Azure).
       Use the tooltips to learn more about the authentication information
       needed for your cluster.
    6. Click a node icon to check the node status and see warnings or
       error information in the right pane. The node-icon color reflects
       the installation readiness for each node:
          + Green (ready to install)
          + Yellow (warning)
          + Red (cannot install)
       Note: If there are warnings or errors, hold your cursor over the
       warning or error in the right pane to see more information.
       Important: If node verification fails, try removing the node and
       retrying the operation. If node verification fails and you abort
       the installation, you must use the Import State command to reset
       the cluster to the last known state. Otherwise, you will not be
       able to perform subsequent MapR Installer operations. See
       [5]Importing or Exporting the Cluster State.
    7. When you are satisfied that the nodes are ready to be installed,
       click Next. The MapR Installer addes the nodes. After the nodes are
       added, you can use the MapR Control System (MCS) to view the nodes
       in the cluster.
    8. Perform any post-expansion steps. Post-expansion steps are
       necessary only if you added a node to a group containing a CLDB or
       Zookeeper.

   If you added a node to a group containing . . . Do this
   Zookeeper only One node at a time, stop and restart the Zookeeper
   service on all Zookeeper nodes, restarting the master Zookeeper node
   last. You do not need to restart the Zookeeper node that was added. See
   [6]Post-Expansion Steps for Extending a Cluster.
   Zookeeper and CLDB

   or
   CLDB only
   One node at a time, restart all services on all nodes following the
   order prescribed in [7]Manual Rolling Upgrade Description. You do not
   need to restart the node that was added. See [8]Post-Expansion Steps
   for Extending a Cluster.

Adding Nodes Using a MapR Installer Stanza

   To add nodes using a MapR Installer Stanza, you add the scaled_hosts2:
   parameter (on-premise clusters) or the scaled_count: parameter
   (cloud-based clusters) to the Stanza file for the group that you want
   to scale. Then you run the Stanza using the install command. The
   services contained in the group are configured for the added node.
   Note: If the group you are trying to scale does not contain the
   mapr-core-5.2.x service, the first group containing mapr-core-5.2.x
   will automatically get scaled.
    1. In the Stanza file, add the scaled_hosts2: or scaled_count:
       parameter:
          + On-Premise Cluster
            Add the scaled_hosts2: parameter to the group that you want to
            scale, specifying the host name(s) or IP address(s) of the
            nodes to be added. In the following example, the
            perfnode132.perf.lab node is added to the CLIENT group:

   Stanza Before Scaling Modified Stanza with scaled_hosts2 Parameter
   (On-Premise Cluster)
groups:
- hosts:
   - perfnode131.perf.lab
   label: CLIENT
- services:
    - mapr-spark-client-2.0.1
    - mapr-hive-client-1.2
    - mapr-hbase-1.1
    - mapr-asynchbase-1.7.0
    - mapr-kafka-0.9.0

groups:
- hosts:
   - perfnode131.perf.lab
   label: CLIENT
   scaled_hosts2:
   - perfnode132.perf.lab
- services:
    - mapr-spark-client-2.0.1
    - mapr-hive-client-1.2
    - mapr-hbase-1.1
    - mapr-asynchbase-1.7.0
    - mapr-kafka-0.9.0

          + Cloud-Based Cluster
            Add the scaled_count: parameter to the group that you want to
            scale. Include a number after the parameter to indicate the
            number of additional nodes to be added to the group. You do
            not need to specify the host names or IP addresses of the
            nodes to be added. In the following example, one additional
            node is added to the CLIENT group:

   Stanza Before Scaling Modified Stanza with scaled_count Parameter
   (Cloud-Based Cluster)
groups:
- hosts:
   - perfnode131.perf.lab
   label: CLIENT
- services:
    - mapr-spark-client-2.0.1
    - mapr-hive-client-1.2
    - mapr-hbase-1.1
    - mapr-asynchbase-1.7.0
    - mapr-kafka-0.9.0

groups:
- hosts:
   - perfnode131.perf.lab
   label: CLIENT
   scaled_count: 1
- services:
    - mapr-spark-client-2.0.1
    - mapr-hive-client-1.2
    - mapr-hbase-1.1
    - mapr-asynchbase-1.7.0
    - mapr-kafka-0.9.0

    2. Run the Stanza file using the install command. See [9]Installing or
       Upgrading MapR Core Using a MapR Installer Stanza. The MapR
       Installer SDK detects the new scaled_host(s) and gives you the
       option to proceed with the installation or cancel.
    3. Perform any post-expansion steps. Post-expansion steps are
       necessary only if you added a node to group containing a CLDB or
       Zookeeper.

   If you added a node to a group containing . . . Do this
   Zookeeper only One node at a time, stop and restart the Zookeeper
   service on all Zookeeper nodes, restarting the master Zookeeper node
   last. You do not need to restart the Zookeeper node that was added. See
   [10]Post-Expansion Steps for Extending a Cluster.
   Zookeeper and CLDB

   or
   CLDB only
   One node at a time, restart all services on all nodes following the
   order prescribed in [11]Manual Rolling Upgrade Description. You do not
   need to restart the node that was added. See [12]Post-Expansion Steps
   for Extending a Cluster.
