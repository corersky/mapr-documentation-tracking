Security Considerations for the MapR PACC

   This section describes key considerations for using Docker containers
   with secure and non-secure MapR clusters.

Secure Clusters

   Docker containers, like other virtualization technologies, allow client
   access from user identities that are not controlled by central IT. As a
   result, these technologies can be problematic when used with clusters
   that are not secure (where trust is based on trusting the client).
   Therefore, MapR suggests that you use secure clusters with MapR PACCs.

   MapR PACCs, and applications built from them, are launched with a MapR
   ticket that contains the application's identity from the perspective of
   the cluster. On secure clusters, the user identity, user ID (UID), and
   group ID (GID) are specified in the MapR ticket and passed to MapR file
   system for cluster communication. The ticket ensures that operations,
   such as authorization and auditing, are performed as the authenticated
   MapR user. A different ticket should be created for each container that
   is launched. The user’s identity should be the identity of the user who
   accesses data.

   All access from Docker containers to the MapR cluster requires a MapR
   ticket be present inside the container. Users or administrators should
   generate a MapR ticket for each container prior to launch, and pass the
   ticket into the container at runtime. The MapR ticket must be generated
   for the user that your applications access the cluster as. You should
   create a container user with the same MAPR_CONTAINER_USER,
   MAPR_CONTAINER_GROUP, MAPR_CONTAINER_GID, and MAPR_CONTAINER_UID
   runtime environment variables.

   Always use service or user tickets, not impersonation tickets. The
   ticket type and lifetime should consider the lifetime of the
   application being deployed. Use of impersonation tickets may allow
   rogue applications running in containers to impersonate arbitrary users
   (including root or mapr) and gain access to any data in the cluster.

   The MapR ticket file location in the container is set with the
   MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable, which is set at runtime
   for the user specified in MAPR_CONTAINER_USER. The ticket file must
   always be stored in /tmp. For example: /tmp/mapr_ticket.

   In case of loss or breach, you can revoke tickets.

Non-Secure Clusters

   On non-secure clusters, you can restrict access by running the
   application inside the container as a user with appropriate privileges
   on the MapR cluster. This is controlled using runtime environment
   variables.
   Note: MapR recommends that you do not use either mapr or root users.
     * MAPR_CONTAINER_USER and MAPR_CONTAINER_UID specify:
          + The default user invoked when starting the container
          + The user that the user application inside the container will
            run as

     * MAPR_CONTAINER_GID represents the GID that the application inside
       the Docker container will run as
     * MAPR_CONTAINER_GROUP represents the group that the application
       inside the Docker container will run as
