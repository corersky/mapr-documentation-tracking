MapR POSIX Clients

   Describes how to install POSIX and FUSE-based POSIX clients.

   This section contains instructions for installing the MapR POSIX
   Clients. The MapR software provides a POSIX loopbacknfs client package
   and FUSE-based POSIX Basic and Platinum client packages. Each
   FUSE-based POSIX client package implies a specific MapR file system
   throughput optimization of n/G per second. These clients can be
   installed and used according to the same principles as the POSIX
   loopbacknfs client.
