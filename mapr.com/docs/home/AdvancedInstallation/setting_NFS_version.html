Installing NFS Using the MapR Installer

   Using the web-based MapR Installer, you can install version 3 or
   version 4 of the Network File System (NFS) on the cluster.

   You can install NFS during a new or incremental installation of MapR
   6.1 or later. The Enable MapR NFS option appears on the Version &
   Services page of the MapR Installer.
   Note these considerations for installing NFS using the MapR Installer:
     * Previous versions of the MapR Installer installed NFS (version 3)
       by default. MapR Installer 1.10 and later do NOT install NSF by
       default. You must select the Enable MapR NFS option to instruct the
       installer to install NFS. When you select the Enable MapR NFS
       option, the NFS Version option appears. NFSv3 is always selected by
       default. NFSv4 is available as an option for MapR 6.1.0 or later
       releases.
       CAUTION:
       The MapR Installer installs but does not secure NFS. Neither NSFv3
       nor NSFv4 provides security by default. You can configure NFSv4
       server to work with Active Directory and Kerberos servers, but you
       must first install Active Directory and Kerberos servers. For more
       information, see [1]Configuring NFSv4 Server for Kerberos. NFSv3
       does not support security.
     * With the MapR 1.10 installer, if you specify a pre-MapR 6.1.0
       release, you must select the Enable MapR NFS option to install NFS.
       Selecting the option causes the installer to install NSFv3 by
       default. The NFS Version option is not available for pre-MapR 6.1.0
       releases.
     * When upgrading to MapR 6.1 or later, the MapR Installer keeps the
       NFS version at version 3. After a new installation of MapR 6.1 in
       which you specified NFSv3, or an upgrade to MapR 6.1 using the MapR
       Installer, you can switch to NFSv4 by using the [2]Incremental
       Install function of the installer.
     * MapR software supports mixed-mode NFS configurations in which some
       nodes of a cluster use NFSv3 and other nodes use NFSv4, but
       mixed-mode configurations cannot be installed using the MapR
       Installer. The MapR Installer installs all nodes as NFSv3 or all
       nodes as NFSv4.
     * NFSv3 and NFSv4 cannot be used on the same node concurrently.
     * A new installation using a MapR Installer Stanza installs NFS only
       if you set enable_NFS: true in the config section of the stanza.

   To install NFS manually, see [3]Installing MapR NFS. To learn more
   about managing and using NFS, see [4]Managing MapR NFS.
