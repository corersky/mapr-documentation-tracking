Understanding Two-Digit and Three-Digit MEPs

   Understanding the differences between the MEP directories on
   package.mapr.com can help you prevent versioning issues.

   To install or update a MapR Expansion Pack (MEP), either manually or by
   using the MapR Installer, you must first choose a MEP version. The MEP
   version that you choose has a corresponding subdirectory on
   [1]package.mapr.com from which the ecosystem packages are retrieved.
   For each released MEP, the [2]package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/ directory
   includes both two-digit and three-digit subdirectories:

   The following table compares the two-digit and three-digit
   subdirectories and describes how they are used.
   MEP Subdirectory Example Continuously Updated? Description
   2-digit MEP-3.0/ Yes Subdirectories using two digits (for example,
   MEP-3.0) contain the latest MEP and patches and are continuously
   updated. For example, if you select MEP 3.0 when using the MapR
   Installer, the installer installs or upgrades your cluster with the
   packages from the most current version of MEP 3.0.x. If the most
   current version is MEP 3.0.1, MEP 3.0.1 is installed. If the most
   current version is MEP 3.0.2, MEP 3.0.2 is installed, and so on.

   If you later decide to make changes to the cluster, the MapR Installer
   applies the packages from the most current version, which can be
   different from the version you installed originally.

   Two-digit MEP version numbers make new patches available automatically
   without the need for system reconfiguration.
   3-digit MEP-3.0.0/ No Subdirectories using three digits contain a fixed
   MEP version, including patches, and are not continuously updated. For
   example, if you select MEP 3.0.0 when using the MapR Installer, the
   installer uses the packages from the MEP-3.0.0 subdirectory and
   continues to use the MEP-3.0.0 subdirectory until you change the
   specified MEP version.

   Three-digit MEP version numbers ensure that your cluster uses only the
   specified MEP version. They are best for users who install MapR
   software manually and do not require automatic updates.

MapR Installer Use of Two-Digit and Three-Digit MEPs

   MapR Installer version 1.5 automatically uses two-digit MEPs. MapR
   Installer versions 1.6 and later use three-digit MEP versions and do
   not allow you to select two-digit MEPs.

Upgrades from MapR Installer 1.5 to 1.6 or later

   If you [3]upgrade the MapR Installer from version 1.5 to version 1.6,
   you see both two-digit and three-digit MEPs in the MEP dropdown list
   for an Incremental Install. The two-digit MEPs continue to operate as
   they did previously, installing the latest three-digit MEP with the
   same first two digits. The three-digit MEPs operate as described
   earlier on this page. MapR Installer version 1.7 displays and supports
   only three-digit MEPs.
   Note: If your cluster uses two-digit MEPs, MapR recommends that you
   upgrade to three-digit MEPs as soon as it is convenient to do so. Doing
   so enables you to use new features such as the "Extend Cluster" feature
   without introducing MEP version inconsistencies. You can upgrade by
   [4]performing an Incremental Install and selecting a three-digit MEP.
