Setting Resource Limits on CentOS/RedHat/Oracle Linux

   While you can use Warden to automatically set resource limits, you may
   want to set limits manually.

   Rather than relying on Warden to set resource file-access limits
   automatically using ulimit, you can use the following procedure to set
   the limits manually.
    1. Edit /etc/security/limits.conf and add a line to set the resource
       limits. For example, set the resource limits to 65536.
<MAPR_USER> - nofile 65536
    2. Edit /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf to add a similar line.
<MAPR_USER> - nproc 64000
    3. Check that the /etc/pam.d/su file contains the following settings:
#%PAM-1.0
auth            sufficient      pam_rootok.so
# Uncomment the following line to implicitly trust users in the "wheel" group.
#auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
# Uncomment the following line to require a user to be in the "wheel" group.
#auth           required        pam_wheel.so use_uid
auth            include         system-auth
account         sufficient      pam_succeed_if.so uid = 0 use_uid quiet
account         include         system-auth
password        include         system-auth
session         include         system-auth
session         required        pam_limits.so
session         optional        pam_xauth.so
    4. Use ulimit to verify settings.
    5. Reboot the system.
    6. Run the following command as the MapR user (not root) at a command
       line: ulimit -n
