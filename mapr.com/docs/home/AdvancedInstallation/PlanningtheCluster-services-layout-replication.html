Service Layout Guidelines for Replication

   Based on the use case, replicating MapR-DB tables and MapR-ES may
   require the installation of MapR Gateways and the HBase client on one
   or more nodes.

Guidelines for Installing Gateways

   When you configure replication for MapR-DB tables or MapR-ES, MapR
   gateways provide one-way communication between a source MapR cluster
   and a destination cluster. It is recommended to install atleast 3
   gateways on the destination cluster. Installing 2 or more gateways on a
   destination cluster allows for replication failover in the event that
   one gateway is unavailable. Installing 3 or more gateways on a large
   clusters enables better throughput for data replication.

Guidelines for Installing HBase Client

   When you configure replication for MapR-DB tables, the HBase client is
   not required by default. However, you must install the HBase client to
   replicate MapR-DB tables in the following situations:
     * You plan to perform autosetup table replication using the MapR-DB C
       API. In this case, you must install the HBase Client on the node
       where the C application will run.
     * You plan to perform autosetup table replication using the maprcli
       table replica autosetup command without directcopy. In this case,
       you must install the HBase Client on the node where you submit the
       maprcli table replica autosetup command. For more information about
       autosetup table replication, see [1]Replica Autosetup for MapR-DB
       Tables.
