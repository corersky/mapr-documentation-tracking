Service Layout Guidelines for Replication

   Based on the use case, replicating MapR Database tables and MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka may require the installation of MapR Gateways
   and the HBase client on one or more nodes.

Guidelines for Installing Gateways

   When you configure replication for MapR Database tables or MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka, MapR gateways provide one-way communication
   between a source MapR cluster and a destination cluster. It is
   recommended to install at least three gateways on the destination
   cluster. Installing two or more gateways on a destination cluster
   allows for replication failover in the event that one gateway is
   unavailable. Installing three gateways on a large cluster enables
   better throughput for data replication. Installing more than three
   gateways can improve availability but is not likely to improve
   replication performance.

Guidelines for Installing HBase Client

   When you configure replication for MapR Database tables, the HBase
   client is not required by default. However, you must install the HBase
   client to replicate MapR Database tables in the following situations:
     * You plan to perform autosetup table replication using the MapR
       Database C API. In this case, you must install the HBase Client on
       the node where the C application will run.
     * You plan to perform autosetup table replication using the maprcli
       table replica autosetup command without directcopy. In this case,
       you must install the HBase Client on the node where you submit the
       maprcli table replica autosetup command. For more information about
       autosetup table replication, see [1]Replica Autosetup for MapR
       Database Tables.
