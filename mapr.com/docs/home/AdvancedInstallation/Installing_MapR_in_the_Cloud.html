Installing MapR in the Cloud

   Provides an overview of MapR cloud installer capabilities.

   With the latest MapR Installer, you can deploy a MapR cluster in the
   cloud quickly and customize your deployment using MapR-provided
   reference templates. You can provision a cluster in Amazon AWS or in
   Microsoft Azure and take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing.
   The following diagram shows the high-level architecture for a
   cloud-based MapR cluster:

   MapR Installer tools and templates provide several options for
   provisioning the cloud and installing the cluster. These options vary
   in:
     * The time it takes to perform the installation
     * The level of customization each option supports
     * The complexity of the installation

   The following diagram shows the different options for provisioning to
   the cloud and installing the cluster. These options allow you to
   customize MapR deployments to meet your business goals and make it
   easier for you to pay for only the MapR software that you use.

Marketplace Offerings

   MapR offerings for Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure allow you to deploy
   MapR clusters quickly to test new features and software versions:
     * [1]MapR Offerings in the AWS Marketplace
     * [2]MapR Offerings in the Azure Marketplace

MapR Reference Templates

   MapR reference templates assist in provisioning. You can use the
   templates as is or modify them to control the way your installation is
   provisioned. The reference templates both provision your instance in
   the cloud and install a MapR cluster to your specifications. For more
   information, see:
     * [3]About the MapR Reference Templates for AWS
     * [4]About the MapR Reference Templates for Azure

MapR Installer Web Interface

   The MapR Installer allows you to install, add services, upgrade, scale,
   and gather information about your MapR on-premise or cloud-based
   cluster. You can use the installer after your cluster is deployed, or
   deploy just the MapR installer and use the web interface or MapR
   Installer Stanzas to customize your installation.

MapR Installer Stanzas

   MapR Installer Stanzas give you a programmatic interface to perform
   most of the functions available in the MapR Installer web insterface.
   See [5]MapR Installer Stanzas.

Custom Images

   MapR tools allow you to build custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) or
   Azure VM images to meet additional security or software requirements
   for your environment. See [6]Creating Custom Images.

Supported Operating Systems

   Supported operating systems and MapR software for the MapR cloud
   installer are:
