Step 5: Set Environment Variables

   Before starting ZooKeeper or Warden, you must complete this step.

   Set [1]Environment Variables for the cluster. The /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh
   script looks for the directory where Java is installed and sets
   JAVA_HOME automatically. However, if you need to specify a different
   location for JAVA_HOME, edit /opt/mapr/conf/env_override.sh. This
   variable must be set before starting ZooKeeper or Warden. For more
   information, see [2]About env_override.sh.
