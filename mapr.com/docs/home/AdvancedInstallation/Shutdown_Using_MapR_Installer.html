Shutting Down a Cluster Using the MapR Installer Shutdown Button

   You can use a single button to shut down MapR software on a cluster.

   The Shutdown button appears on the status page of the MapR Installer
   web interface when you connect to an installed cluster using MapR
   Installer 1.6 or later. The Shutdown button shuts down Warden and
   Zookeeper, which in turn shut down other running services that are part
   of a MapR cluster. When you use the Shutdown button, the MapR Installer
   implements the same orderly shutdown used to perform software upgrades.
   The Shutdown button works differently depending on where the cluster is
   deployed:
   Deployment Shutdown Button Behavior
   On premise Does not stop non-MapR software and does not power off the
   nodes.
   In the cloud Shuts down (but does not remove) all the nodes in the
   cluster:
     * If the installer node is part of the cluster, the installer node is
       not shut down, but Warden shuts down the services on the installer
       node.
     * To shut down the installer node, use AWS-console or Azure-portal
       commands to stop the instance.

   CAUTION: If a shutdown is initiated on an AWS cluster using an instance
   store, all data will be lost.

   To use the Shutdown button:
    1. Review [1]Shutting Down a Cluster for some pre-shutdown steps you
       may want to perform before shutting down Warden and Zookeeper.
    2. Use a browser to connect to the cluster using the MapR Installer
       URL:
https://<Installer Node hostname/IPaddress>:9443
    3. On the status screen, click the Shutdown button. The MapR Installer
       asks you if you want to continue.
    4. Click OK. The MapR Installer displays the Authentication screen.
    5. Enter your authentication information if requested, and click
       Shutdown. The installer begins the shutdown process.
    6. To restart MapR software on the cluster, see [2]Starting Up a
       Cluster Using the MapR Installer Startup Button.
       Note: Do not attempt to restart the cluster until you have
       confirmed that it is shut down. For an on-premise cluster, the
       presence of the Startup button on the MapR Installer status page
       indicates that the cluster is shut down and ready to be started.
       For a cluster deployed in the cloud, the Startup button must be
       present, and you must use the AWS or Azure console to verify that
       the servers are down before restarting.
