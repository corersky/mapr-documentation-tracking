Connectivity

   This section describes and helps you troubleshoot connectivity
   requirements.

Hostname

   Each node in the cluster must have a unique hostname, resolvable
   forward and backward with every other node with both normal and reverse
   DNS name lookup.

   Run hostname -f to check the node's hostname. For example:
$ hostname -f
node125.corp.example.com

   If hostname -f returns a name, run getent hosts `hostname` to return
   the node's IP address and fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).
$ getent hosts `hostname`
10.250.1.53     node125.corp.example.com

   To troubleshoot hostname problems, edit the /etc/hosts file as root. A
   simple /etc/hosts might contain:
127.0.0.1     localhost
10.10.5.10    mapr-hadoopn.maprtech.prv mapr-hadoopn

   A common problem is an incorrect loopback entry (127.0.x.x) that
   prevents the IP address from being assigned to the hostname. For
   example, on Ubuntu, the default /etc/hosts file might contain:
127.0.0.1     localhost
127.0.1.1     node125.corp.example.com

   A loopback (127.0.x.x) entry with the node's hostname will confuse the
   installer and other programs. Edit the /etc/hosts file and delete any
   entries that associate the hostname with a loopback IP. Only associate
   the hostname with the actual IP address.
   Note: For more information about Ubuntu's default /etc/hosts file, see
   [1]https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/871966.

   Use the ping command to verify that each node can reach the others
   using each node's hostname. For more information, see the [2]hosts(5)
   man page.

Common Users

   A user that accesses the cluster must have the same credentials and
   user ID (uid) on each node in the cluster. Every person or department
   that runs MapR jobs must have an account and must also belong to a
   common group ID (gid). The uid for each user, and the gid for each
   group, must be consistent across all nodes.

   A mapr user must exist, and have the same UID across all the cluster
   nodes. The mapr user has full privileges to administer the cluster. If
   you create the mapr user before you install MapR, you can test for
   connectivity issues. If you do not create the mapr user, installing
   MapR automatically creates the user for you. The mapr user ID is
   automatically created on each node if you do not use a directory
   service, such as LDAP.

   To create a group, add a user to the group, or create the mapr user,
   run the following command as root substituting a uid for m and a gid
   for n. (The error "cannot lock /etc/passwd" suggests that the command
   was not run as root.)
$ useradd mapr --gid n --uid m

   Example: $ groupadd -g 5000 mapr $ useradd -g 5000 -u 5000 mapr

   To verify that the users or groups were created, su mapr. Verify that a
   home directory was created (usually /home/mapr) and that the users or
   groups have read-write access to it. The users or groups must have
   write access to the /tmp directory, or Warden will fail to start
   services.

Optional: Passwordless ssh

   Setting up passwordless ssh is straightforward. On each webserver node,
   generate a key pair and append the key to an authorization file. Then
   copy this authorization file to each node, so that every node is
   available from the webserver node.

   su mapr (if you are not already logged in as mapr) ssh-keygen -t rsa -P
   '' -f ~/ filename

   The ssh-keygen command creates filename , containing the private key,
   and filename .pub, containing the public key. For convenience, you may
   want to name the file for the hostname of the node. For example, on the
   node with hostname "node10.10.1.1,"

   ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/node10.10.1.1

   In this example, append the file /home/mapr/node10.10.1.1.pub to the
   authorized_keys file.

   Append each webserver node's public key to a single file, using a
   command like cat filename .pub >> authorized_keys. (The key file is
   simple text, so you can append the file in several ways, including a
   text editor.) When every webserver node's empty passphrase public key
   has been generated, and the public key file has been appended to the
   master "authorized_keys" file, copy this master keys file to each node
   as ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, where ~ refers to the mapr user's home
   directory (typically /home/mapr).
