Troubleshooting

   Describes changes to core-site.xml file to troubleshoot issues.

fs.mapr.bind.retries Parameter

   If there are issues related to unavailability of port, set the value
   for fs.mapr.bind.retries configuration parameter in core-site.xml file
   to true. If true, the client tries to bind during client initialization
   for 5 minutes before failing. By default, the fs.mapr.bind.retries
   configuration parameter is set to false.

   For example, your entry in core-site.xml file should look similar to
   the following:
<property>
  <name>fs.mapr.bind.retries</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>Bind during client initialization for 5 minutes</description>
</property>

fs.mapr.bailout.on.library.mismatch Parameter

   When running any application with older versions of the MapR JARs, the
   system could hang if the older JARs link to the native library
   installed on cluster nodes that have been updated to a newer MapR
   version. The fs.mapr.bailout.on.library.mismatch parameter detects
   mismatched libraries, fails the job, and logs an error message. The
   parameter is enabled by default. You can disable the parameter on all
   the YARN nodes and resubmit the job for the job to continue to run. To
   disable the parameter, you must set it to false in the core-site.xml
   file.

   For example, to disable, your entry in the core-site.xml file should
   look similar to the following:
<property>
  <name>fs.mapr.bailout.on.library.mismatch</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>Disabling to continue running jobs</description>
</property>

libMapRClient.so Binary

   The libMapRClient.so binary is in /opt/mapr/lib directory and also
   bundled in maprfs-XXX.jar file. All the applications that include the
   JAR also have libMapRClient.so binary. If there are multiple
   libMapRClient.so on a machine and if you know the location of all the
   JARs, you can run the following commands to check the mapr version of a
   binary:
# jar tvf mapr-<XXX>.jar | grep libMapRClient.so
# jar xvf mapr-<XXX>.jar com/mapr/fs/native/Linux/x86_64/libMapRClient.so
# cd com/mapr/fs/native/Linux/x86_64/
# strings libMapRClient.so | grep mapr-version
# cd /opt/mapr/lib
# strings libMapRClient.so | grep mapr-version

   This is useful in determining if there are old binaries installed on
   the system.
