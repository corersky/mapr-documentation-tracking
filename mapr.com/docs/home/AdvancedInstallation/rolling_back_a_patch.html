Rolling Back a Patch

   Removing a previously installed patch must be done manually.
   Alternatively, you can revert to a previous version of the patch by
   installing over a newer version. To minimize the impact of this change
   on your cluster, contact MapR Support for technical assistance.

   Always test patch installs in a test environment before applying
   patches to production environments. If a newly installed patch for a
   given software version delivers unexpected behavior, you can remove the
   patch or install an older patch for the same MapR software version over
   the current version. The latest patch version (for example, version n)
   and the previous patch version (version n-1), are always available on
   [1]sftp.mapr.com. To log in, specify maprpatches for the Login ID, and
   leave the Password field blank.
   For technical assistance in removing a patch and restoring the
   functionality that existed before the patch was installed, open a case
   with [2]MapR Support.
   Note: Rolling back a cluster from a newer MapR version to an older
   version is not supported. See [3]Applying a Patch Manually.
