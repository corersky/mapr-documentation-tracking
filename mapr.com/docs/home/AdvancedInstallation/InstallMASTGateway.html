Installing the MAST Gateway

   Describes how to install the MapR Automated Storage Tiering (MAST)
   Gateway service.

   The MAST Gateway acts as the centralized entry point for all the
   operations that need to be performed on the tiered storage. The MAST
   Gateway can be installed (with or without MapR Filesystem) on specific
   hosts on the MapR cluster with access to the 3rd party cloud storage
   (for cold tier operations) or on the edge node. Before you install the
   MAST Gateway, review the [1]Pre-Installation Considerations.
   See [2]Configuring the MAST Gateway Service after installing the MAST
   Gateway.

Installing the MAST Gateway Using the MapR Installer

   When you install MapR 6.1 or later using the [3]MapR Installer, select
   the MapR-XD: Cloud Scale Data Platform auto-provisioning template to
   automatically install the MAST Gateway on all the nodes.

Installing the MAST Gateway from the Command-line

   Run the following command on the node where you want to install the
   MAST Gateway:
   CentOS yum install mapr-mastgateway
   Ubuntu apt-get install mapr-mastgateway
   Suse   zypper install mapr-mastgateway

Installing Additional MAST Gateways from the Command-line

   If you install a new MAST Gateway on a cluster already performing
   tiering operations (using other installed MAST Gateways), perform the
   following steps to force CLDB to rebalance utilization of all the MAST
   Gateways including the newly added MAST Gateway:
    1. Install the mapr-mastgateway package on the node.
    2. Run [4]configure.sh with the -R option to register the MAST Gateway
       with CLDB.
       For example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       After this command runs, newly created volumes are assigned to this
       MAST Gateway.
    3. Run the following command to force CLDB to reassign existing
       volumes to the least utilized MAST Gateways:
/opt/mapr/server/mrconfig mastgateway refreshvolassignment <volume-name>
       You must run this command once for each volume to reassign. MapR
       recommends running this command for all volumes if MAST Gateway is
       either newly added to the cluster or permanently removed from the
       cluster. When this command runs, CLDB reassigns the volume tiering
       operation to the least utilized MAST Gateway, which might be the
       newly added MAST Gateway, to force rebalancing.
       For more information, see [5]mastgateway refreshvolassignment.
