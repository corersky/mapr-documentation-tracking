Step 6: Configure Nodes

   Connect nodes to the cluster, configure security, and arrange node
   storage.

   You run the configure.sh script on a node to enable the node to
   communicate with the cluster. You must configure each node that is part
   of the cluster and each node that connects to the cluster as a client.

   Perform the following operations to configure a node:
   Operation Description
   [1]Prepare to run configure.sh This topic describes some information
   you will need to gather before running the configure.sh script.
   [2]Enabling Security These steps configure your cluster for security,
   enabling security for authentication, authorization, and data.
   Data-at-rest (DARE) encryption can also be enabled during this task. If
   you do not want your cluster to be secure, do not perform the steps in
   this procedure. Go to [3]Configuring Nodes without Security.
   [4]Configure nodes without security These steps configure each node to
   be a part of the cluster but do not configure security. If you want
   your cluster to be secure, do not perform this procedure. Go to
   [5]Enabling Security.
   [6]Configure storage (only if the mapr-fileserver is installed on the
   node) To configure storage on a node, you can use configure.sh to run
   disksetup, or you can manually run disksetup. You need to perform this
   step only if you chose not to configure storage when you ran
   configure.sh to configure the nodes.
