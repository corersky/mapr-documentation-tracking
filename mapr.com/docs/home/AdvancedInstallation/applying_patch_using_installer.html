Applying a Patch Using the MapR Installer

   The MapR Installer automates much of the work involved in applying MapR
   patches.
   For clusters with many nodes, using the MapR Installer can save you
   time and reduce the likelihood of errors when compared with other
   methods of applying patches. With the MapR Installer, you can apply a
   patch during a:
     * New installation of MapR software
     * Maintenance update
     * Version upgrade
     * Incremental Install

   Note: Applying a patch using the MapR Installer is an offline update
   (not a rolling update).
   To apply a patch using the MapR Installer:
    1. Obtain the patch from MapR Support.
    2. Ensure that the cluster is ready for a patch update. For more
       information, see [1]Verify Cluster Readiness for a Patch. Then
       return to this procedure.
    3. Start the MapR Installer. For more information, see [2]MapR
       Installer.
    4. Select the Patch file option:

   If . . . Then . . .
   MapR software is not yet installed on the cluster (new installation)
   Click the Patch file option under the MapR Version field on the Version
   & Services page.
   MapR software is already installed (maintenance update or version
   upgrade) Do one of the following:
          + Click the Maintenance Update button. If you are performing a
            maintenance update, the Patch file option appears on the
            Maintenance Update page. For more information, see
            [3]Performing a Maintenance Update.
          + Click the Version Upgrade button on the MapR Installer page.
            If you are performing a version upgrade, the Patch file option
            appears under the MapR version on the Upgrade Version &
            Services page.
          + Click the Incremental Install button. The Patch file option
            appears on the Version & Services page.

       The installer prompts you to select the patch.
    5. Select the patch file, and click Choose. The installer verifies
       that the mapr-core version of the installed core (or the core
       version you are upgrading to) matches the core version of the patch
       file name. The installer also ensures that the patch file starts
       with mapr-patch, ends with rpm or deb, and does not include text
       such as client or nfs (to ensure that it is a core patch file). The
       installer does not ensure that the patch you are applying is a
       patch number higher than the one that is already installed (if a
       patch is already installed).
    6. Make other installer selections as needed. The patch is uploaded
       and will be installed in the background after the installer has
       applied any core packages.
       Note: The next time you run the MapR Installer on the cluster, the
       installer shows the updated patch version on the Incremental
       Install page or, if you enable patch installation, on the Version
       Upgrade or Maintenance Update page.
