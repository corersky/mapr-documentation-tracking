Using the MapR Internet Repository

   This section describes how to make packages available through the MapR
   internet repository.

   The MapR repository on the internet provides all of the packages
   required to install a MapR cluster using native tools such as yum on
   RedHat, Oracle Linux, or CentOS, zypper on SUSE, or apt-get on Ubuntu.
   Installing from the MapR repository is generally the easiest
   installation method, but requires the greatest amount of bandwidth.
   With this method, each node is connected to the internet to download
   the required packages.

   Set up repositories by completing the steps for your RedHat/Oracle
   Linux/CentOS, SUSE, or Ubuntu distribution.
