Pre-Installation Considerations

   Before installing the MAST Gateway, review the following
   recommendations.

   By default, the MAST Gateway uses 16 threads for volume and file
   offload and recall operations and another 16 threads for handling
   internal operations and other operations such as reads (which triggers
   automatic recall requests), writes, etc. Each thread processes offload
   or recall of a container (associated with a volume). Each MAST Gateway
   can process one or more volumes (and associated containers)
   simultaneously depending on the number of threads available for
   processing the containers associated with the volumes. Each volume is
   assigned to a MAST Gateway for a tiering operation irrespective of the
   number of containers associated with the volume.

   For example, suppose a volume has 5 containers. The MAST Gateway
   allocates 5 threads, one per container, to process the offload of that
   volume’s data; the other 11 threads are available for other
   tiering-related operations on other tiering-enabled volumes. Suppose a
   volume has 20 containers. The MAST Gateway allocates all 16 threads to
   process the offload of that volume’s data and as threads are freed,
   other unprocessed containers associated with the volume are processed.
   Now, suppose that there are multiple MAST Gateways for the volume that
   has 20 containers. Volume offload is then distributed among the
   multiple MAST gateways, leading to enhanced performance of the cluster.
   If there are multiple large volumes with multiple containers, more than
   one MAST Gateway is recommended to process all the containers
   associated with all the volumes.

   If there are limited number of nodes that can access the cold tier
   (because of controlled access to WAN, proxy setup, etc.), install and
   run MAST Gateway on only those nodes and set up proxy server parameters
   in the mastgateway.conf file. See step 5 in [1]Configuring the MAST
   Gateway Service for more information on the configuration parameters to
   set for using a proxy server. On the other hand, if all the cluster
   nodes can access the tier, then consider the following before deploying
   the MAST Gateway:
    1. A single MAST Gateway can offload at around 300 MB/sec at full
       throttle. So, compute the minimum number of MAST Gateways based on
       network capacity of the connection to the tier.
    2. If you expect many volume offloads and recall operations to get
       triggered at the same time, consider installing mastgateway on a
       few more nodes or adding more MAST Gateways at a later time. See
       [2]Installing Additional MAST Gateways from the Command-line for
       information.

   In general, allocate at least 2GB of memory for the MAST Gateway
   operations. The memory consumption can increase during heavy load. See
   settings for configuring memory for MAST Gateway in Step 7 for
   [3]Configuring the MAST Gateway Service.
   Note: Before installing, ensure that the system time on all the cluster
   nodes is the same. If the system time on CLDB and file server nodes are
   different, the mtime rule for migrating data might not work as
   intended. If you see a time skew alarm in the cluster, resolve the
   alarm immediately to prevent catastropic failures.
