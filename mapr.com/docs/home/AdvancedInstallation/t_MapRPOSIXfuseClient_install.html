Install FUSE-Based POSIX Client

   This section describes how to install the POSIX Client package on your
   machine.

   To install mapr-posix-client-* on your machine, where * refers to basic
   or platinum client package, perform the steps below for your version of
   Linux, as the root user or as sudo. The package is installed to the
   /opt/mapr/bin/ directory.
    1. Run the following command to install the POSIX client package on
       your machine.
          + For CentOS, RedHat, or Oracle Linux
# yum install mapr-posix-client-*
          + For Suse
# zypper install mapr-posix-client-*
          + For Ubuntu
# sudo apt-get install mapr-posix-client-*
       Note: When you run the command, based on your license type, replace
       * with basic or platinum.
    2. Run [1]configure.sh to set this node as the client node.
       For example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N <clustername> -C <CLDBhost> -Z <ZooKeeperhost>
-c
       Note: With the configure.sh command, specify -c to set this node as
       the client node. If CLDB and Zookeeper hosts were specified
       earlier, then -R must also be specified with configure.sh. For
       example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N <clustername> -C <CLDBhost> -Z <ZooKeeperhost>
-c -R
       To use the client with a secure cluster, add the -secure option to
       configure.sh.

   To use the client:
     * [2]Configure the POSIX client.
     * [3]Start the POSIX client.
     * [4]Mount the cluster.
