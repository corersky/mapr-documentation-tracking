Install FUSE-Based POSIX Client

   Describes how to install the FUSE-based POSIX client package on your
   system.

   FUSE based POSIX clients require the FUSE kernel module. Run the
   following command to load the kernel module: modprobe fuse

   You can install the FUSE-based POSIX client on any node, including
   cluster nodes.

   To install the mapr-posix-client-* package on your machine, where *
   refers to the basic or the platinum client package, perform the
   following steps for your version of Linux, as the root user, or using
   sudo. The package is installed to the /opt/mapr/bin/ directory.
    1. Run the following command to install the POSIX client package on
       your machine.
          + For CentOS, RedHat, or Oracle Linux
# yum install mapr-posix-client-*
          + For Suse
# zypper install mapr-posix-client-*
          + For Ubuntu
# sudo apt-get install mapr-posix-client-*
       Note: Based on your license type, replace * with basic or platinum.
    2. Run [1]configure.sh to set this node as the client node.
          + For a fresh installation of the POSIX client, run configure.sh
            as follows:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N <clustername> -C <CLDBhost> -Z <ZooKeeperhost>
-c
          + When reinstalling the POSIX client, run configure.sh with the
            -R option to reuse the existing configuration.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -c -R
       Note: To use the POSIX client with a secure cluster, add the
       -secure option when running configure.sh.

   To use the client:
     * [2]Configure the POSIX client.
     * [3]Start the POSIX client.
     * [4]Mount the cluster.
