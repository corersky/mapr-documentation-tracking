Using the Enable MapR DARE Option

   You use the Enable MapR DARE option to enable data-at-rest encryption
   for MapR volumes.

   This option appears on the Version & Services page of the web-based
   MapR Installer when the Enable MapR Secure Cluster option is selected.
   The Enable MapR DARE option is deselected by default.

   For more information about data-at-rest encryption, see [1]Encryption
   in MapR.

Considerations for Enabling MapR DARE Using the MapR Installer

   Before using the Enable MapR DARE option, review these considerations:
   Important: Once enabled, the Enable MapR DARE option cannot be
   disabled, since disk encryption cannot be turned off without
   reformatting the disks.
     * The Enable MapR DARE option can only be used during the initial
       installation of a MapR cluster or during an incremental install.
     * You cannot select the Enable MapR DARE option when:
          + The Enable MapR Secure Cluster option is deselected.
          + You perform an upgrade operation using the MapR Installer.
            Security changes are not allowed during an upgrade using the
            MapR Installer.
     * If you select the Enable MapR DARE option, you can no longer
       deselect the Enable MapR Secure Cluster option during an
       Incremental Install operation.
