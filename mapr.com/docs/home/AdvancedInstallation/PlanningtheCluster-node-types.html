Node Types

   Depending on the size of your cluster, nodes may or may not perform
   specialized work.

   In a production MapR cluster, some nodes are typically dedicated to
   cluster coordination and management, and other nodes are tasked with
   data storage and processing duties. An edge node provides user access
   to the cluster, concentrating open user privileges on a single host. In
   smaller clusters, the work is not so specialized, and a single node may
   perform data processing as well as management.

Nodes Running ZooKeeper and CLDB

   High latency on a ZooKeeper node can lead to an increased incidence of
   ZooKeeper quorum failures. A ZooKeeper quorum failure occurs when the
   cluster finds too few copies of the ZooKeeper service running. If the
   ZooKeeper node is running other services, competition for computing
   resources can lead to increased latency for that node. If your cluster
   experiences issues relating to ZooKeeper quorum failures, consider
   reducing or eliminating the number of other services running on the
   ZooKeeper node.

Nodes for Data Storage and Processing

   Most nodes in a production cluster are data nodes. FileServer and
   NodeManager run on data nodes. Data nodes can be added or removed from
   the cluster as requirements change over time.

Edge Nodes

   So-called Edge nodes provide a common user access point for the MapR
   webserver and other client tools. Edge nodes may or may not be part of
   the cluster, as long as the edge node can reach cluster nodes. Nodes on
   the same network can run client services and other services, but edge
   nodes and client nodes may not host MapR Monitoring components.
