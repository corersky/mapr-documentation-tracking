Installing MapR Data Access Gateway

   This topic includes instructions for using package managers to download
   and install the MapR Data Access Gateway from the MEP repository.
   For instructions on setting up the MEP repository, see [1]Step 10:
   Install Ecosystem Components Manually.

   The MapR Data Access Gateway is included in MEP repositories beginning
   with MEP 5.0.0. The MapR Data Access Gateway is a service that acts as
   a proxy and gateway for translating requests between lightweight client
   applications and the MapR cluster. For MEP 6.0.0, the MapR Database
   JSON REST API and Python OJAI client use this service.

   In the MapR Installer, the gateway is not visible as a unique service
   but is installed when the MapR DataBase service is selected and can
   also be installed manually using this procedure. The gateway should be
   installed on at least two nodes, if possible, but not on CLDB or
   Zookeeper nodes. It is recommended to install the service on the same
   node as the gateway server.
   Run the following commands as root or using sudo.
    1. Install the MapR Data Access Gateway package:
       On Ubuntu:
apt-get install mapr-data-access-gateway
       On RedHat/ CentOS:
yum install mapr-data-access-gateway
       On SUSE:
zypper install mapr-data-access-gateway
    2. Run configure.sh -R:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       Note: Because the MapR Data Access Gateway is managed by Warden,
       you don't have to restart Warden after installing the gateway.
       Warden brings up the service after a few minutes.

   To manage and administer the gateway, see [2]Administering the MapR
   Data Access Gateway.

   To learn more about the gateway, see [3]Understanding the MapR Data
   Access Gateway.
