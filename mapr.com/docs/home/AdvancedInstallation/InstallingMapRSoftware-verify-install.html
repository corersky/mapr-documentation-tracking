Step 4: Verify Installation Success

   To confirm success, check each node.

   To verify that the software was installed successfully, check the
   /opt/mapr/roles directory on each node. The software is installed in
   the /opt/mapr directory and a file is created in /opt/mapr/roles for
   every service that installs successfully. The following example shows
   the /roles directory with services that installed successfully:

Example

# ls -l /opt/mapr/roles
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 11 07:29 cldb
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 11 07:29 fileserver
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 11 07:01 nodemanager
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 11 07:01 resourcemanager
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 11 07:29 apiserver
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul 11 07:29 zookeeper
