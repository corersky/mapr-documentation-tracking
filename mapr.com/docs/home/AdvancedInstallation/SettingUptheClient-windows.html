Installing the MapR Client on Windows

   This section describes how to install the MapR Client on Windows.

   Compatibility with Network Address Translation (NAT) Adapters

   In VM environments, the MapR Client on Windows works with a single NAT
   virtual adapter as long as it is the only virtual adapter configured
   for the VM. If you want to use more than one adapter, you must use
   other types of virtual adapters. If you use multiple NAT adapters in
   your VM environment, your jobs and file-system operations will fail.
    1. Make sure Java is installed on the computer and that the JAVA_HOME
       environment variable is set correctly.
       Note: The path that you set for the JAVA_HOME environment variable
       must not include spaces.
    2. Create the directory \opt\mapr on your c: drive (or another hard
       drive of your choosing). You can use Windows Explorer, or type the
       following at the command prompt: mkdir c:\opt\mapr
    3. Set the MAPR_HOME environment variable to c:\opt\mapr
    4. Open the command line.
    5. Use the following command to navigate to MAPR_HOME: cd %MAPR_HOME%
    6. Download the file for the version that you want to install into
       MAPR_HOME:
https://package.mapr.com/releases/<version>/windows/<package name>
    7. Extract the archive by right-clicking on the file and selecting
       Extract All...
    8. From the command line, run configure.bat to configure the client.
       In the following examples, the -N parameter specifies the cluster
       name, the -c (lowercase) parameter specifies a client
       configuration, the -secure parameter is added if the cluster is
       secure, the -C (uppercase) parameter specifies the CLDB nodes, and
       the -HS parameter specifies the HistoryServer node. To ensure that
       the client can connect in the event of a CLDB node failure, all
       CLDB nodes are specified. For more information about the syntax,
       parameters, and behavior of configure.sh, see [1]configure.sh.
       For details about the syntax, parameters, and behavior of
       configure.bat, see [2]configure.sh.

        Non-secure cluster example

server\configure.bat -N my.cluster.com -c -C mynode01:7222,mynode02:7222,mynode0
3:7222 -HS nodeA

        Secure cluster example

server\configure.bat -N my.cluster.com -c -secure -C mynode01:7222,mynode02:7222
,mynode03:7222

    9. To use this client with a secure cluster or clusters, copy the
       ssl_truststore file from the /opt/mapr/conf directory on the
       cluster to the c:\opt\mapr\conf directory on the client.
       If this client will connect to multiple clusters, you must merge
       the ssl_truststore files on the server by using the
       /opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh tool, and then copy the merged
       file to c:\opt\mapr\conf on the client. For an example of merging
       the ssl_truststore files, see step 3 in [3]Configuring Secure
       Clusters for Running Commands Remotely.
       See [4]Managing Secure Clusters for details on how to connect to a
       secure cluster.
