   MapReduce version 2 applications from a Windows Client.
   Before running any MapReduce version 2 (MRv2) applications from a
   Windows client, add the following property to the mapred-site.xml file:
<property>

   The mapred-site.xml file for MRv2 applications is located in the
   following directory:
