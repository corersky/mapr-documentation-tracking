Using the Enable MapR Secure Cluster Option

   You use the Enable MapR Secure Cluster option to control whether or not
   the cluster is configured as a secure cluster.
   This option appears on the Version & Services page of the web-based
   MapR Installer.

About the Enable MapR Secure Cluster Option

   Using this option controls [1]secure by default installation in a MapR
   cluster. When you select the option, the MapR Installer runs the
   configure.sh script on the container location database (CLDB) master to
   generate security keys and then distributes the keys to all the other
   CLDBs. The installer also distributes certificates to all the other
   nodes and activates security for the ecosystem components that support
   security.

   Certain ecosystem components either do not support security or cannot
   be secured by the MapR Installer. If you enable security, you will not
   be allowed to select services such as Impala or Sentry.

   Beginning with MapR 6.1, data-on-wire encryption is enabled by default
   for newly created volumes when the Enable MapR Secure Cluster option is
   selected. Data-on-wire encryption encrypts data in a volume during
   transmission over the wire. In a secure cluster, you can enable or
   disable data-on-wire encryption for individual volumes using MCS, the
   maprcli, or REST API commands.

Using the Option With New and Already Installed Clusters

   You can select or deselect the Enable MapR Secure Cluster option during
   a new installation or during an [2]Incremental Install.
     * For new installations:
          + The option is selected by default, meaning that new
            installations are configured with security unless you deselect
            the option.
          + Deselecting the option causes the cluster to be installed as a
            nonsecure cluster.
     * For clusters that are already installed with MEP 4.0.0 or later:
          + You can select or deselect the option during an [3]Incremental
            Install:
               o If security is not currently configured and you select
                 the option, the cluster will be configured with security.
               o If security is already configured, you can remove
                 security by deselecting the option.
                 Note: If Drill is installed, be sure to review the
                 limitations described in [4]Securing Drill before
                 removing security. Additional steps must be taken so that
                 Drill in a nonsecured cluster can access all Drill
                 znodes.

Using the Option During an Incremental Install

   Normally, Incremental Install operations are conducted online. However,
   selecting or deselecting the Enable MapR Secure Cluster option during
   an Incremental Install requires the MapR Installer to stop the Warden
   and Zookeeper services, bringing the cluster offline temporarily.

   In some instances, the Enable MapR Secure Cluster option is
   unavailable. For example, you cannot select this option during an
   upgrade of a nonsecured MapR 5.x cluster to MapR 6.0 or later. You must
   complete the upgrade to MapR 6.0 or later first and then use the
   Incremental Install function to enable security.
