Infrastructure

   This section identifies certain software and settings that contribute
   to your node's infrastructure.

Network Time

   To keep all cluster nodes time-synchronized, MapR requires software
   such as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server (or chrony for RHEL 7) to
   be configured and running on every node. If server clocks in the
   cluster drift out of sync, serious problems will occur with certain
   MapR services. MapR raises a Time Skew alarm on any out-of-sync nodes.
   For more information about obtaining and installing NTP, see
   [1]http://www.ntp.org/.

   Advanced: It is recommended to install an internal time server that the
   cluster nodes sync with directly. Using this internal time server, if
   internet connectivity is lost, the time on the cluster nodes still
   stays in sync. Refer to the preceding documentation link for NTP, for
   more details.

System Locale

   Ensure your system locale is set to en_us. For more information about
   setting the system locale, see [2]this website.

Syslog

   Syslog should be enabled on each node to preserve logs regarding killed
   processes or failed jobs. Modern versions such as syslog-ng and rsyslog
   are possible, making it more difficult to be sure that a syslog daemon
   is present. One of the following commands should suffice:
syslogd -v
service syslog status

rsyslogd -v
service rsyslog status

Default umask

   To prevent significant installation problems, ensure that the default
   umask for the root user is set to 0022 on all MapR nodes in the
   cluster. The umask setting is changed in the /etc/profile file, or in
   the .cshrc or .login file. The root user must have a 0022 umask because
   the MapR admin user requires access to all files and directories under
   the /opt/mapr directory, even those initially created by root services.

ulimit

   ulimit is a command that sets limits on the user's access to
   system-wide resources. Specifically, it provides control over the
   resources available to the shell and to processes started by it.

   The mapr-warden script uses the ulimit command to set the maximum
   number of file descriptors (nofile) and processes (nproc) to 64000.
   Higher values are unlikely to result in an appreciable performance
   gain. Lower values, such as the default value of 1024, are likely to
   result in task failures.
   Warning: The MapR recommended value is set automatically every time
   Warden is started.

   Depending on your environment, you might want to set limits manually
   for service accounts used to run I/O-heavy operations rather than
   relying on Warden to set them automatically using ulimit.

PAM

   Nodes that will run the MapR Control System can take advantage of
   [3]Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) if found. Configuration files
   in the /etc/pam.d/ directory are typically provided for each standard
   Linux command. MapR can use, but does not require, its own profile.

Security - SELinux, AppArmor

   SELinux (or the equivalent on other operating systems) must be disabled
   during the install procedure. If the extra security provided by SELinux
   is required, it can be enabled in permissive mode after installation,
   and rules can be defined by observing regular operations while the
   cluster is running. Please note that SElinux introduces significant
   complexity and should be managed by an experienced system
   administrator, outside of MapR support.

TCP Retries

   On each node, set TCP retries for net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 to 5 so that
   MapR can detect unreachable nodes with less latency.
   Note: The installation automatically sets TCP retries for
   net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries to 4 on each node.
    1. Edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf and add the following line:
       net.ipv4.tcp_retries2=5
    2. Save the file and run:
       sysctl -p

NFS

   Disable the stock Linux NFS server on nodes that will run the MapR NFS
   server. For NFSv4 to work with Kerberos, install Active Directory and
   Kerberos servers and then join all the cluster nodes to the Active
   Directory server before installing MapR NFSv4 server.

iptables/firewalld

   Enabling iptables on a node may close ports that are used by MapR. If
   you enable iptables, make sure that [4]required ports remain open.
   Check your current IP table rules with the following command:
$ service iptables status

   In CentOS 7, firewalld replaces iptables. To check your current IP
   table rules, use this command:
systemctl status firewalld

   To ensure that required ports are available, disable firewalld by using
   this command:
systemctl disable firewalld

Transparent Huge Pages (THP)

   For data-intensive workloads, MapR recommends disabling the Transparent
   Huge Pages (THP) feature in the Linux kernel.

   RHEL Example
$ echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

   CentOS 7 Example
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

   Ubuntu Example
$ echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag

Automated Configuration

   Some users find tools like Puppet or Chef useful to configure each node
   in a cluster. Make sure, however, that any configuration tool does not
   reset changes made when MapR packages are later installed.
   Specifically, do not let automated configuration tools overwrite
   changes to the following files:
     * /etc/sudoers
     * /etc/sysctl.conf
     * /etc/security/limits.conf
     * /etc/udev/rules.d/99-mapr-disk.rules
