Using a Local Repository

   This section describes how to make packages available through a local
   repository.

   You can set up a local repository on each node to provide access to
   installation packages. With this method, nodes do not require internet
   connectivity. The package manager on each node installs from packages
   in the local repository. To set up a local repository, nodes need
   access to a running web server to download the packages.

   Subsequent sections cover how to create a single repository that
   includes both MapR components and the Hadoop ecosystem components on .
