Setting Up the MapR Control System

   Describes how to configure and access the MapR Control System (MCS).

   The MapR Control System allows you to manage the cluster (including
   nodes, volumes, users, and alarms) through a comprehensive graphical
   user interface with all the functionality of the command-line or REST
   APIs.

Installing the webserver and apiserver

   In prior releases, the mapr-webserver package contained both the MCS UI
   static files and the server running the Java application. Starting from
   v6.0, the UI static files are in mapr-webserver and the mapr-apiserver
   runs the server that sends the queries. The apiserver allows you to
   perform cluster administration programmatically.

   When you install mapr-webserver, the mapr-apiserver is automatically
   installed because of the dependency on the mapr-apiserver to perform
   the queries. If mapr-webserver is installed, you can use the MCS
   graphical user interface to manage your cluster. You can also install
   the mapr-apiserver independently to run APIs or web clients that query
   or programmatically access MapR Filesystem, MapR Database, and other
   components; however, without the webserver, the MCS UI will not be
   available on this node to perform administrative tasks using the UI.

   To install the webserver and/or apiserver, see [1]Installing MapR
   and/or MapR Ecosystem Components. If you install using the MapR
   Installer, by default, the installer selects one instance of the
   mapr-webserver and mapr-apiserver to install. You can specify
   additional webserver and/or apiserver instances to install in the
   Configure Service Layout page. If you install manually, run the
   appropriate command on the node to install the mapr-webserver and/or
   mapr-apiserver packages. For more information on the command to run,
   see [2]Step 3: Install MapR Service Packages.

   For the purposes of high availability, the recommendation is to run at
   least 2 instances of the webserver and 2 instances of the apiserver.

Configuring Metrics and Logging to Enable Metrics Visualization

   During installation using the MapR Installer, you can configure metrics
   and logging using settings on the Monitoring page of the MapR Installer
   user interface. The metrics collection infrastructure must be installed
   because the MapR Control System relies on these metrics to provide
   graphs and charts. If the metrics collection infrastructure is not
   installed, you cannot visualize the metrics in the panes on the MapR
   Control System. If you did not install metrics collection or logging
   during your initial installation, you can add it later by selecting the
   feature during an [3]Incremental Install.

Browser Compatibility

   The MapR Control System is web-based, and works with the following
   browsers:
     * Chrome 58 and later
     * Safari 11.x for v6.0.1
       Safari 10.x for v6.0
       Note: Safari Private Window is not supported.
     * Firefox 53 and later
     * Microsoft Edge 15, 16, and 17

Launching MapR Control System

   To use the MapR Control System (MCS), navigate to the host that is
   running the WebServer in the cluster. MapR Control System access to the
   cluster is typically via HTTP on port 8080 or via HTTPS on port 8443.
   You should disable pop-up blockers in your browser to allow MapR to
   open help links in new browser tabs.

   The first time you open the MCS via HTTPS from a new browser, the
   browser alerts you that the security certificate is unrecognized. This
   is normal behavior for a new connection. Add an exception in your
   browser to allow the connection to continue.
