Known Issues for Cloud-Based Clusters

   Before installing a MapR cluster in the cloud, be sure to review these
   known issues:
   Issue Description
   IN-2012 An issue in the Java version used by the MapR Installer
   prevents the Installer from supporting a domain suffix that starts with
   a number. Azure generates a random string for the domain suffix, so
   this problem can occur intermittently.
   Workaround The mapr-setup.sh script checks for the DNS Suffix during
   installation and fails with an error similar to the following when the
   suffix begins with a number. If you see this error message, create new
   nodes and retry the installation with a DNS Suffix that does not start
   with a number.
ERROR: The DNS Suffix 14x325z0ek4ezp1skptqsztkyg.dx.internal.cloudapp.net starts
 with a number which is incompatible with OpenJDK keytool application. This clus
ter is invalid. Recreate the cluster again; DNS Suffix is 14x325z0ek4ezp1skptqsz
tkyg.dx.internal.cloudapp.net; First character of DNS Suffix is: 1\n\*.*

   IN-860 If you create a cluster using a MapR marketplace offering for
   Amazon AWS and use ephemeral drives, and you then shut down the
   cluster, most MapR services cannot be restarted. This happens because
   the disks are new, and the MapR cluster is not aware of the ephemeral
   drives.

   Workaround: Do not use clusters with ephemeral drives, or do not shut
   down the cluster. When the cluster is not in use, terminate it.
   IN-974 If you request public IP addresses for the MapR Installer nodes
   in Amazon AWS, the IP addresses can change after a shutdown and restart
   of the cluster, and the MapR Installer status page continues to display
   the old public IP addresses.

   Workaround: None.
