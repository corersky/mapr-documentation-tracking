Known Issues for Cloud-Based Clusters

   Before installing a MapR cluster in the cloud, be sure to review these
   known issues:
   Issue Description
   IN-860 If you create a cluster using a MapR marketplace offering for
   Amazon AWS and use ephemeral drives, and you then shut down the
   cluster, most MapR services cannot be restarted. This happens because
   the disks are new, and the MapR cluster is not aware of the ephemeral
   drives.

   Workaround: Do not use clusters with ephemeral drives, or do not shut
   down the cluster. When the cluster is not in use, terminate it.
   IN-974 If you request public IP addresses for the MapR Installer nodes
   in Amazon AWS, the IP addresses can change after a shutdown and restart
   of the cluster, and the MapR Installer status page continues to display
   the old public IP addresses.

   Workaround: None.
