Installing Spark on Mesos

   This section includes instructions to download and install Apache Spark
   on Apache Mesos.
   The MapR distribution of Spark on Mesos is only certified on CentOS.

   Spark 2.1.0 runs with Apache Mesos 1.0.0 or later. You do not need to
   apply any special patches of Mesos. If you are already running a Mesos
   cluster, you can skip this topic.

   Install Mesos following the instructions at [1]Getting Started with
   Mesos.
   Note: If you are building Mesos, execute the build steps as user
   'mapr'. Also change the owner of the directory where you have unpacked
   the Mesos archive to user and group 'mapr'.
cd /path/to/mesos
sudo chown -R mapr:mapr /path/to/mesos
