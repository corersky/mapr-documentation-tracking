Service Layout in a Cluster

   As your cluster grows, it is important to segregate some services on
   different nodes.

   How you assign services to nodes depends on the scale of your cluster
   and the MapR license level. For a single-node cluster, no decisions are
   involved. All of the services you are using run on the single node. On
   medium clusters, the performance demands of the CLDB and ZooKeeper
   services requires them to be assigned to separate nodes to optimize
   performance. On large clusters, good cluster performance requires that
   these services run on separate nodes.

   The cluster is flexible and elastic. Nodes play different roles over
   the lifecycle of a cluster. The basic requirements of a node are not
   different for management or for data nodes.

   As the cluster size grows, it becomes advantageous to locate control
   services (such as ZooKeeper and CLDB) on nodes that do not run compute
   services. The MapR Converged Community Edition does not include HA
   capabilities, which restricts how many instances of certain services
   can run. The number of nodes and the services they run will evolve over
   the life cycle of the cluster.

   The architecture of MapR software allows virtually any service to run
   on any node, or nodes, to provide a high-availability, high-performance
   cluster. Below are some guidelines to help plan your cluster's service
   layout.
   Note: It is possible to install MapR on a one- or two-node demo
   cluster. Production clusters may harness hundreds of nodes, but five-
   or ten-node production clusters are appropriate for some applications.
