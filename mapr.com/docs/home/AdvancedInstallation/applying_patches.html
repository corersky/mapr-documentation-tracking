Applying a Patch

   You can apply a patch by using the MapR Installer, by using the command
   line (a manual process), or by using a MapR Installer Stanza.

   MapR version-specific patches are available here:
   http://package.mapr.com/patches/releases/. Contact support@mapr.com if
   you need more information or if you face any problems with patch
   installation.
   Note: Beginning with MapR 5.2.1, patches are no longer published to
   [1]http://package.mapr.com/. Contact your support representative for
   patch information for MapR 5.2.1 or later.
