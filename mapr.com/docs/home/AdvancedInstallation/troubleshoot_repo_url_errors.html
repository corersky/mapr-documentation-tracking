Troubleshooting Repository URL Errors

   This page describes how to troubleshoot an issue in which an incorrect
   repository URL is stored in the MapR Installer properties.json file.

How Repository URL Errors Can Occur

   The properties.json file stores information such as the user ID of the
   cluster administrator, the user ID of the MapR Installer, the OS type,
   Internet access information, and the repository URL. Once the
   repository URL has been stored in properties.json, the MapR Installer
   assumes that the URL will not change.

   If you run mapr-setup.sh -r <url> and you make a mistake when typing
   the URL, the incorrect URL is added into the MapR Installer
   properties.json file. If you later run mapr-setup.sh -r <url> again but
   with the correct URL, the properties.json is not updated. Even
   upgrading the installer packages does not update the repository URL in
   properties.json.

   Some versions of the MapR Installer generate a warning if you try to
   correct the URL by running mapr-setup.sh -r <url> again, but older
   versions of the MapR Installer do not generate a warning. Whether or
   not a warning is generated, you can correct the issue, but how you do
   so depends on the version of the MapR Installer that is installed.

Fix Using MapR Installer 1.11 or Later

   MapR Installer 1.11 and later versions generate a warning if you run
   mapr-setup.sh -r <url> and provide a new URL. The warning describes two
   ways to change the URL currently stored in the properties.json file:
     * You can use the reload or remove command, and then specify a new
       URL:
         1. Use one of the following commands:
bash /tmp/mapr-setup.sh -R <new_url> reload
            or
bash /tmp/mapr-setup.sh remove
            Using the remove command removes properties.json, the
            installer database, and the installer packages, but not the
            setup script.
         2. Specify the new URL:
bash /tmp/mapr-setup.sh -r <new_url>
     * You can manually edit the properties.json file:
         1. Edit the properties.json file to specify the new URL:
edit /opt/mapr/installer/data/properties.json
         2. Reload the MapR Installer:
systemctl restart mapr-installer

Fix Using MapR Installer 1.10 or Earlier

   MapR Installer 1.10 and earlier do NOT generate a warning if you run
   mapr-setup.sh -r <url> and provide a new URL. To pass a new repository
   value into properties.json for MapR Installer versions 1.10 or earlier,
   you must first remove the installer files:
mapr-setup.sh remove

   Using the remove command removes properties.json, the installer
   database, and the installer packages, but not the setup script. After
   the files are removed, you can rerun mapr-setup.sh to specify the new
   repository URL:
bash /tmp/mapr-setup.sh -r <new_url>

   To run mapr-setup.sh, see [1]MapR Installer. For information about
   options you can use with mapr-setup.sh, see [2]Using mapr-setup.sh.
