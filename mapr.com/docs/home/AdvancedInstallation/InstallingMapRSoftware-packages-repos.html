Step 2: Prepare Packages and Repositories

   In order to correctly install services, each node must have access to
   the package files.

   Each node must have access to the package files. MapR separates its
   distribution into the following two repositories that contain the
   package files:
     * MapR packages. These provide core functionality for MapR clusters,
       such as the MapR file system.
     * MapR ecosystem packages. These packages are not specific to MapR.
       Examples include the packages for Hive and Pig.

   You can make packages available to each node, as described in
   subsequent sections, using MapR's internet repository, a local
   repository, or a local path with rpm or deb package files. For
   information about packages and repositories for MapR software and
   Hadoop Ecosystem tools, see [1]MapR Repositories and Packages.
