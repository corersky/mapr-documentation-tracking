Step 2: Prepare Packages and Repositories

   In order to correctly install services, each node must have access to
   the package files.

   The MapR software distribution is separated into two repositories that
   contain the package files:
     * MapR packages. These provide core functionality for MapR clusters,
       such as the MapR file system.
     * MapR ecosystem packages. These packages are not specific to MapR.
       Examples include the packages for Hive and Pig.

   Some MapR services have internal dependencies that require additional
   packages. For example, when you install the CLDB service on a node, the
   node must also have mapr-core and mapr-fileserver installed. You can
   install dependencies on each node before beginning the MapR
   installation process, or you can configure repositories and allow the
   package manager on each node to resolve the dependencies. For a list of
   package dependencies, see [1]Packages and Dependencies for MapR
   Software.

   You can make packages available to each node, as described in
   subsequent sections, using the MapR internet repository, a local
   repository, or a local path with rpm or deb package files. For
   information about packages and repositories for MapR software and
   Hadoop Ecosystem tools, see [2]MapR Repositories and Packages.
