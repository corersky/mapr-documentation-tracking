Enabling or Disabling Metrics Collection or Logging

   You can use the MapR Installer to enable or disable metrics collection
   and logging during a new or incremental installation.

   During installation using the MapR Installer, you can configure metrics
   and logging using settings on the Monitoring page of the MapR Installer
   user interface. Installing the metrics collection infrastructure is
   selected by default because the MapR Control System relies on these
   metrics to provide graphs and charts. Logging is deselected by default.

   If you did not install metrics collection or logging during your
   initial installation, you can add it later by selecting the feature
   during an [1]Incremental Install.
   If you installed metrics collection or logging during your initial
   installation but you want to disable it, you can do so by deselecting
   the feature during an [2]Incremental Install.
   Note: If you do not install (or choose to uninstall) the metrics
   collection infrastructure, the MapR Control System cannot display
   graphs and charts.
