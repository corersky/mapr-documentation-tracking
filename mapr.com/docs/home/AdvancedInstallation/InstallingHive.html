Installing Hive

   This topic includes instructions for using package managers to download
   and install Hive from the MEP repository.
   For instructions on setting up the MEP repository, see [1]Step 10:
   Install Ecosystem Components Manually
   Note: If you are installing Hive 2.1, you can use Tez instead of
   MapReduce to improve query performance. For more information, See
   [2]Hive 2.1 and Tez 0.8. A link to the steps for configuring Hive on
   Tez is provided later in this procedure.
   You can install Hive on a node in the MapR cluster or on a MapR client
   node. Installation of HiveServer2 on a client node is not supported by
   MapR. If you wish to install HS2 on a client node, note that one or
   more required JAR files may not be installed during the installation of
   mapr-client. Copy the following JAR file from a resource manager node
   to the MapR client node:
/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-<X.X.X>/share/hadoop/yarn/hadoop-yarn-server-resourceman
ager-<X.X.X>-mapr-<YYYY>.jar

   Here:
   X.X.X Refers to the version (for example, hadoop-2.7.0)
   YYYY Refers to the release tag of ecosystem component (for example,
   1602)
   Note: Copying the JAR file may allow you to work with Hive in
   non-secure mode.

   See the [3]Hive Release Notes for a list of fixes and new features.

   Hive is distributed as the following packages:
   Package Description
   mapr-hive The core Hive package.
   mapr-hiveserver2 The Hive package that enables HiveServer2 to be
   managed by the warden, allowing you to start and stop HiveServer2 using
   maprcli or the MapR Control System. The mapr-hive package is a
   dependency and will be installed if you install mapr-hiveserver2. At
   installation time, Hiveserver2 is started automatically.
   mapr-hivemetastore The Hive package that enables the Hive Metastore to
   be managed by the warden, allowing you to start and stop Hive Metastore
   using maprcli or the MapR Control System. The mapr-hive package is a
   dependency and will be installed if you install mapr-hivemetastore. At
   installation time, the Hive Metastore is started automatically.
   mapr-hivewebhcat The Hive package that enables WebHCat to be managed by
   the warden, allowing you to start and stop WebHCat using maprcli or the
   MapR Control System. The mapr-hive package is a dependency and will be
   installed if you install mapr-hivewebhcat. At installation time, the
   WebHCat is started automatically.

   Make sure the environment variable JAVA_HOME is set correctly. Example:
# export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-sun

   You can set these system variables by using the shell command line or
   by updating files such as /etc/profile or ~/.bash_profile. See the
   Linux documentation for more details about setting system environment
   variables.
   Note: The MapR cluster must be up and running before installing Hive.
   Execute the following commands as root or using sudo.
    1. On each planned Hive node, install Hive packages.
          + To install Hive:

            On CentOS / RedHat
yum install mapr-hive

            On SUSE
zypper install mapr-hive

            On Ubuntu
apt-get install mapr-hive

          + To install Hive and HiveServer2:

            On CentOS / RedHat
yum install mapr-hive

            On SUSE
zypper install mapr-hive mapr-hiveserver2

            On Ubuntu
apt-get install mapr-hive mapr-hiveserver2

          + To install Hive, HiveServer2, and HiveMetastore:

            On CentOS / RedHat
yum install mapr-hive mapr-hiveserver2 mapr-hivemetastore

            On SUSE
zypper install mapr-hive mapr-hiveserver2 mapr-hivemetastore

            On Ubuntu
apt-get install mapr-hive mapr-hiveserver2 mapr-hivemetastore

          + To install Hive, HiveServer2, HiveMetastore and WebHCat:

            On CentOS / RedHat
yum install mapr-hive mapr-hiveserver2 mapr-hivemetastore mapr-hivewebhcat

            On SUSE
zypper install mapr-hive mapr-hiveserver2 mapr-hivemetastore mapr-hivewebhcat

            On Ubuntu
apt-get install mapr-hive mapr-hiveserver2 mapr-hivemetastore mapr-hivewebhcat

       Note: If you are using derby as the underlying database to create
       metastore, do not install mapr-hiveserver2 and mapr-hivemetastore
       on the same node as mapr-hive. This configuration results in a java
       run-time exception when you attempt to start the hive CLI. In order
       to run Hive in embedded mode, do not start HiveServer2 and Hive
       Metastore; instead, make sure the underlying database is consistent
       using the schemaTool. In embedded mode, Metastore is used as
       library with Hive CLI; Hive CLI opens connection and executes all
       queries against the Metastore DB.
    2. Configure database for Hive Metastore.
       See [4]Configuring Database for Hive Metastore for more
       information.
    3. Run [5]configure.sh with the -R option.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       Starting in MEP 4.0, Hive should be configured by running the
       $MAPR_HOME/server/configure.sh script with the -R  option
       immediately after installing Hive. Hive demons will not start
       automatically if Hive is not configured correctly. See [6]Hive
       Security for more information.

   After Hive is installed, the executable is located at:
   /opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/bin/hive.

   See [7]Hive User Impersonation for the steps to configure user
   impersonation for Hive and the MapR cluster.

   To configure Hive on Tez, see [8]Configuring Hive 2.1 and Tez 0.8.
