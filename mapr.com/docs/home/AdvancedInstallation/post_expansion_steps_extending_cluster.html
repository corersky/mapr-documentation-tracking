Post-Expansion Steps for Extending a Cluster

   You must perform post-expansion steps if you added a node to a group
   containing the CLDB or Zookeeper.
   For more information about extending a cluster, see [1]Extending a
   Cluster by Adding Nodes.

Restarting Zookeeper Nodes

   If you used the MapR Installer Extend Cluster function to add a node to
   a group containing Zookeeper only, you must restart Zookeeper on all
   Zookeeper nodes except for the added node.

   One node at a time, stop and restart the Zookeeper service on all
   Zookeeper nodes, restarting the master Zookeeper node last. Use the
   restart steps below.

Restarting All Services for Zookeeper and CLDB

   If you used the MapR Installer Extend Cluster function to add a node to
   a group containing Zookeeper and CLDB, or CLDB only, you must restart
   all services on all nodes.

   One node at a time, restart all services on all nodes following the
   group upgrade order prescribed in [2]Manual Rolling Upgrade
   Description. You do not need to restart the node that was added. Use
   the restart steps below.

Restart Steps

    1. Change to the root user (or use sudo for the following commands).
    2. Stop Warden.
sudo service mapr-warden stop
    3. Stop Zookeeper.
service mapr-zookeeper stop
    4. Start the ZooKeeper on nodes where it is installed.
service mapr-zookeeper start
    5. On all nodes, start Warden. Example:
service mapr-warden start
    6. Over a period of time (depending on the cluster size and other
       factors) the cluster comes up automatically. After the CLDB
       restarts, there is a 15-minute delay before replication resumes, in
       order to allow all nodes to register and heartbeat. This delay can
       be configured using the [3]config save command to set the
       cldb.replication.manager.start.mins parameter.
