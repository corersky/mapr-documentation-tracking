Deleting a MapR Cluster in Azure

   You delete a MapR cluster in Azure by using the MapR Installer Destroy
   button or by deleting the resource group.

   The Destroy button is present when the MapR Installer detects cloud
   installations that were created using MapR scripts. Note that any data
   contained in the cluster will be lost when you use the Destroy button
   or delete the resource group.

   To remove an Azure cluster by using the Destroy button:

       password.
    3. Enter your security credentials and MapR cluster admin password,
       and click OK.
