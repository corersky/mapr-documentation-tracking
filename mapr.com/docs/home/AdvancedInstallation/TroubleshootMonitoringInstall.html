Troubleshoot MapR Monitoring Installation Errors

   Review the following solutions to errors that you may encounter when
   you run configure.sh to configure MapR Monitoring.

Elasticsearch Errors

   could not determine matching interface
          Cause: The DNS is probably not setup correctly on this node.
          Solution: Contact your DNS administrator or verify that
          /etc/hosts and /etc/nssswitch.conf are configured correctly. The
          etc/hosts file should list the host names and the hosts
          parameter in /etc/nssswitch.conf should be set to files dns.

   Failed to create <esdb directory name>
          Cause: There is not enough disk space, configure.sh was not run
          as the root user, or the index directory path is not valid.
          Solution: Complete the following steps and then re-run
          configure.sh:

          + Verify that there is enough disk space.
          + Verify that the filesystem where the index directory will be
            created is not read-only. See [1]Log Aggregation and Storage
            for more information on the index directory location.
          + If you included the -ESDB parameter, verify that the index
            directory path uses a valid format:
            /<existing_directory1>/<existing_directory2>/<new index
            directory>.

   Failed to resolve hostname
          Cause: The DNS is probably not set up correctly on this node.
          Solution: Contact your DNS administrator or verify that
          /etc/hosts and /etc/nssswitch.conf are configured correctly.
          /etc/hosts should list the host names if the DNS database is not
          updated, and the hosts parameter in /etc/nssswitch.conf should
          be set to files dns

OpenTSDB Errors

   Incompatible asynchbase jar found
          Cause:The version of asynchbase installed on this node is not
          compatible with OpenTSDB.
          Solution:Install the correct asynchbase package on each OpenTSDB
          node. See the MEP release notes to determine the compatibility
          between package versions.

   Failed to install asynchbase Jar file
          Cause: There is not enough disk space, the filesystem is
          read-only, or configure.sh was not run as the root user.
          Solution: Complete the following steps and then re-run
          configure.sh:

          + Verify that you are logged in as the root user or using sudo.
          + Verify that there is enough disk space.
          + Verify that the filesystem containing the /opt/mapr/opentsdb
            directory is mounted as read/write.

   Failed to create TSDB tables - need to rerun configure.sh -R or run
          create_table.sh as $MAPR_USER
          Cause: On a secure cluster, this issue usually occurs when you
          run configure.sh to configure the nodes to use MapR Monitoring
          without first creating MapR user tickets for the root user and
          the $MAPR_USER.
          Solution: Complete one or all of the following steps:

          + Verify that you have a MapR user ticket for both root and the
            $MAPR_USER before running configure.sh or create_table.sh. Run
            maprlogin print to verify that you have a MapR user ticket for
            the mapr user and the root user. If you need to generate a
            MapR user ticket, run maprlogin password.
          + Re-run configure.sh. For example, configure.sh -R -OT
            <comma-separate list of OpenTSDB nodes> -ES <comma-separate
            list of Elasticsearch nodes>
          + Run ${OTSDB_HOME}/share/opentsdb/tools/create_table.sh to
            create OpenTSDB tables in the mapr.monitoring volume.

Fluentd Errors

   fluentd service not enabled - missing clusterid
          Cause: The MapR cluster was not up and running before
          configure.sh was run with the options to configure MapR
          Monitoring.
          Solution: Complete the following steps and then re-run
          configure.sh:

          + Verify that the CLDB services is running. If not, start Warden
            with the following command: service mapr-warden start.
          + Verify that the $MAPR_HOME/conf/clusterid file exists.

Collectd Errors

   collectd service not enabled - missing clusterid
          Cause: The MapR cluster was not up and running before
          configure.sh was run with the options to configure MapR
          Monitoring.
          Solution: Complete one or all of the following steps and then
          re-run configure.sh:

          + Verify that the CLDB services is running. If not, start Warden
            with the following command: service mapr-warden start.
          + Verify that the $MAPR_HOME/conf/clusterid file exists.

Grafana Errors

   Failed to pick default data source host
          Cause: The OpenTSDB nodes list defined by the -OT parameter was
          incorrect.
          Solution: Check the syntax and the validity of those nodes.

   Failed to create scratch config file
          Cause: There is not enough disk space, configure.sh was not run
          as the root user, or the filesystem was mounted as read-only.
          Solution: Complete one or all of the following steps and then
          re-run configure.sh:

          + Verify that you are logged in as the root user or using sudo.
          + Verify that there is enough disk space.
          + Verify that the filesystem containing /opt/mapr/grafana is
            mounted as read/write.

   Failed to change the port
          Cause: The sed utility failed to edit a port value in the
          temporary configuration file. This may occur due to issues with
          filesystem permissions, disk space, or file corruption.
          Solution: Complete the following steps and then re-run
          configure.sh:

          + Verify that the filesystem containing /opt/mapr/grafana is
            mounted as read/write.
          + Verify that there is enough disk space.
          + Re-install the MapR Monitoring packages.

   Failed to configure ssl for grafana
          Cause: The sed utility failed to edit a port value in the
          temporary configuration file. This can occur due to issues with
          filesystem permissions, disk space, or file corruption.
          Solution: Complete the following steps and then re-run
          configure.sh:

          + Verify that the filesystem containing /opt/mapr/grafana is
            mounted as read/write.
          + Verify that there is enough disk space.
          + Re-install MapR Monitoring packages.

   ERROR: Failed to install grafana warden config file
          Cause: There is not enough disk space, configure.sh was not run
          as the root user, or the filesystem containing /opt/mapr/grafana
          is mounted as read-only.
          Solution: Complete the following steps and then re-run
          configure.sh:

          + Verify that you are logged in as the root user or using sudo.
          + Verify that there is enough disk space.
          + Verify that the filesystem containing /opt/mapr/grafana is
            mounted as read/write.

Kibana Errors

   Failed to configure elasticsearch server URL
          Cause: There is not enough disk space, configure.sh was not run
          as the root user, or the filesystem containing /opt/mapr/kibana
          is mounted read-only.
          Solution: Complete the following steps and then re-run
          configure.sh:

          + Verify that you are logged in as the root user or using sudo.
          + Verify that there is enough disk space.
          + Verify that the filesystem containing /opt/mapr/kibana is
            mounted as read/write.

   Failed to configure ssl for Kibana
          Cause: There is not enough disk space or the root user does not
          have the required directory permissions to create the file in
          the /opt/mapr/kibana/kibana-<version>/config directory.
          Solution: Complete the following steps and then re-run
          configure.sh:

          + Verify that there is enough disk space.
          + Verify that the filesystem containing /opt/mapr/kibana is
            mounted as read/write.

   Kibana logon unsuccessful because Searchguard "Service Unavailable"
          Cause: On a slower server, Kibana logons sometimes do not
          succeed because the Searchguard configuration containing the
          user names and passwords has not finished loading. You might
          notice an error like the following in the Elasticsearch
          MapRMonitoring.log:

[2018-06-30T07:47:15,062][ERROR][c.f.s.a.BackendRegistry  ] Not yet initialized
(you may need to run sgadmin)

          Solution: Try using the following command to restart
          Elasticsearch:

maprcli node services -name elasticsearch -action restart -nodes $(hostname -f)
