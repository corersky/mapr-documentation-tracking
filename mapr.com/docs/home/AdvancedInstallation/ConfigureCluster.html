Configuring the Cluster

   This section contains information on configuring MapR clusters.

   After installing the MapR core and any desired Hadoop components, you
   might need to perform additional tasks to ready the cluster for
   production.
   [1]Configure the OJAI Distributed Query Service If you want to use the
   optional [2]OJAI Distributed Query Service, you must install Drill and
   configure and register the service.
   [3]Setting up Topology The locations of nodes and racks in a cluster
   determine the location of replicated copies of data. Optimally defined
   cluster topology results in data being replicated to separate racks,
   providing continued data availability in the event of rack or node
   failure.
   [4]Setting Up Volumes Keeping volume hierarchy efficient to maximize
   data availability. Without a volume structure in place, performance
   will be negatively affected. Referring to the volume plan created in
   Planning the Cluster, use the MapR Control System or the maprcli
   command to create and mount distinct volumes to allow more granularity
   in specifying policy for subsets of data. If you do not set up volumes,
   and instead store all data in the single volume mounted at /, it
   creates problems in administering data policy later as data size grows.
   [5]Setting Up Central Configuration MapR services can be configured
   globally across the cluster, from master configuration files stored in
   a MapR-FS, eliminating the need to edit configuration files on all
   nodes individually.
   [6]Designating NICs for MapR If multiple NICs are present on nodes, you
   can configure MapR to use one or more of them, depending on the
   cluster's need for bandwidth. See [7]Cluster Design Objectives for more
   information.
   [8]Setting up MapR NFS Access data on a licensed MapR cluster, mount
   the MapR cluster, and use standard shell scripting to read and write
   live data through NFS, which can be faster than using hadoop fs
   commands.
   [9]Configuring Authentication If you use Kerberos, LDAP, or another
   authentication scheme, make sure PAM is configured correctly to give
   MapR access.
   [10]Configuring Permissions By default, users are able to log on to the
   MapR Control System, but do not have permission to perform any actions.
   You can grant specific permissions to individual users and groups.
   [11]Setting Usage Quotas You can set specific quotas for individual
   users and groups.
   [12]Configuring Alarm Notifications If an alarm is raised on the
   cluster, MapR sends an email notification. For example, if a volume
   goes over its allotted quota, MapR raises an alarm and sends email to
   the volume creator.
   [13]Setting Up the Client and[14] MapR POSIX Client You can access the
   cluster either by logging into a node on the cluster, or by installing
   MapR client software on a machine with access to the cluster's network.
   [15]Working with Mirror Volumes To access multiple clusters or mirror
   data between clusters, work with mirror volumes.
