Installing KSQL

   This topic includes instructions for using package managers to download
   and install KSQL from the MEP repository.

Preparing for Installation

   KSQL is included in MEP repositories beginning with MEP 6.0.0. For
   instructions on setting up the MEP repository, see [1]Step 10: Install
   Ecosystem Components Manually.

   The default KSQL configuration parameters are stored in
   /opt/mapr/ksql/ksql-<version>/etc/ksql.

KSQL Operational Modes

   To install KSQL, you can use the [2]MapR Installer or the manual steps
   on this page. KSQL can be used in one of two modes:
   Mode Description
   Interactive Mode This mode is non-secure and allows developers to write
   KSQL queries interactively using the KSQL CLI.
   Non-interactive Mode This mode is more secure than the Interactive mode
   and is designed for KSQL query production deployment. Since the queries
   are known ahead of time, you can run non-interactive queries with more
   restrictive permissions.

   Installation steps are the same for both modes. Run the following
   commands as root or using sudo.

Install KSQL in Interactive or Non-interactive Mode

   You can install the mapr-kafka-ksql package on as many or as few nodes
   as you want. Installing on multiple nodes can increase availability of
   the service.

   On Ubuntu:
apt-get install mapr-kafka-ksql

   On RedHat/ CentOS:
yum install mapr-kafka-ksql

   On SUSE:
zypper install mapr-kafka-ksql

Verify KSQL Installation

   To confirm successful installation, you can:
     * Check for the presence of the KSQL home folder at
       /opt/mapr/ksql/ksql-<version>.
     * Perform a test run:
         1. Start the KSQL server:
/./opt/mapr/ksql/ksql-[version]/bin/ksql-server-start /opt/mapr/ksql/ksql-<versi
on>/etc/ksql/ksql-server.properties
         2. Verify that KSQL is running by making a call to
            http://localhost:8084/info. For example:
curl http://localhost:8084/info
       The expected response is:
{"KsqlServerInfo":{"version":"(version)"}}

Configure KSQL

   To configure KSQL, see [3]KSQL Configuration.
