Creating a Key Pair

   Key pairs allow you to prove your identity electronically in AWS. Key
   pairs are region specific. You need a key pair for every region in
   which you intend to deploy. To create a key pair:
    1. In AWS, navigate to Services > EC2 > Key Pairs.
    2. Click Create Key Pair.
    3. Give the key pair a name, and click Create.
    4. Save the key-file. You will need the key-file if you need to ssh
       into any of the hosts.
