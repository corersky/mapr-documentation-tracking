Using a Local, Shared Repository With the MapR Installer

   The MapR Installer can use a local repository instead of an Internet
   repository.

   When you run the mapr-setup.sh script, it attempts to connect to
   [1]package.mapr.com and configures an Internet repository. If there is
   no Internet connectivity, the script asks for archive files so that it
   can create a local repository.
   Note: Passing -a <full path each archive file> to the mapr-setup.sh
   script bypasses the Internet connectivity check and automatically
   creates a local repository with the provided archive files.

   To install with a local, shared repository, the node that runs
   mapr-setup.sh needs the following:
     * Any OS dependencies or Java Development Kit (JDK) packages that are
       required.
     * A webserver. The script will attempt to install a webserver on the
       node if a webserver is not available. The webserver is needed to
       provide the MapR package files to each node in the cluster.
     * Archive file(s). To install MapR 5.2 and above, you need to
       download mutiple archive files. To install MapR 5.1 or 5.0, you
       need to download a single archive file.

   For MapR 5.2 and above
          + The MapR Core archive file. Download the MapR archive file
            mapr-<version>GA.<dep|rpm>.tgz from one of the following
            locations, based on the operating system of the node:
               o [2]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v.<version>/redhat/
               o [3]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v.<version>/ubuntu/
               o [4]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v.<version>/suse/
            Note: The package mapr-v<version>GA-upgrade.<rpm/deb>.tgz is
            not for use with the MapR Installer.
          + The MapR Installer archive file. Based on the operating system
            of the node, download
            mapr-installer-<version>.<yyyymmdd>.<dep|rpm>.tgz from one of
            the following locations:
               o [5]http://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/redhat
               o [6]http://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/ubuntu
          + The MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) archive file. Based on the
            operating system of the node, download
            mapr-mep-<version>.<yyyymmdd>.<dep|rpm>.tgz from one of the
            following locations:
               o [7]http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/red
                 hat
               o [8]http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/ubu
                 ntu
               o [9]http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/sus
                 e

   Note: The MEP-<version> directory can be represented by a 2-digit
   number or a 3-digit number. The 3-digit MEP directory is for users who
   do manual installations. The 2-digit MEP directory is for use by the
   MapR installer.
       For MapR 5.0 and 5.1 The MapR archive file.Download the
   mapr-5.0-5.1.<yyyymmdd><dep|rpm>.tgz archive file from one of the
   following locations, based on the operating system of the node:
          + [10]http://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/ubuntu/
          + [11]http://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/redhat/

     * The mapr-setup.sh script.

   Note: Red Hat clusters must have access to a local EPEL repository, as
   described in [12]Set Up the Internet Repository: RHEL/CentOS. The EPEL
   repository enables installation of these packages:
     * clustershell
     * pdsh
     * pdsh-rcmd-ssh
     * sshpass

   After downloading the mapr-setup.sh script and the archive files to the
   node that will run the MapR Installer, run the following command from
   the directory that contains the mapr-setup.sh script:
bash ./mapr-setup.sh â€“a <full path to the archive files>
