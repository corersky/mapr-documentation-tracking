Impala Prerequisites

   To successfully install and run Impala, verify that the system meets
   the following hardware and software requirements:

   CAPTION:

   Prerequisite Requirement
   Operating System

   MapR provides packages for the following 64-bit operating systems:
     * RHEL/CentOS 6.5, 6.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 only
     * Ubuntu and SUSE are not supported

   MapR Software Version 5.2
   MEP repository Set up the MEP respository, if you have not already done
   so. For instructions on setting up the MEP repository, see [1]Step 10:
   Install Ecosystem Components Manually
   Hive Metastore

   To use Impala for MapR, you must install and configure a Hive
   metastore. Configure the Hive metastore service and connect to a MySQL
   database through the service. For more information, see [2]Installing
   Hive.

   Note: Verify that hive-site.xml contains the hive.metastore.uris
   setting, and substitute the appropriate host name for
   metastore_server_host on every Impala server node.
   Example
<property>
 <name>hive.metastore.uris</name>
 <value>thrift://<metastore_server_host>:9083</value>
</property>

   Hive Hive 1.2 is required to run Impala 2.5.0. Earlier versions of Hive
   are not supported. If you have earlier versions of Hive installed,
   installing the Impala packages uninstalls Hive, except for the
   configuration logs and process identifiers, and updates the mapr-hive
   package with Hive 1.2. Impala must have access to the same metastore
   database that Hive uses. For Hive configuration information, see the
   [3]Hive documentation.
   MapR Database MapR Database binary tables (HBase 1.1.8 API) are
   required to run Impala. Install mapr-hbase-1.1.8 from the MEP
   repository.
   Java JDK 1.7 or 1.8
