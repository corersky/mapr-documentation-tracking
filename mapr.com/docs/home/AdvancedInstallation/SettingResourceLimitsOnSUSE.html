Setting Resource Limits on SUSE

   While you can use Warden to automatically set resource limits, you may
   want to set limits manually.

   Rather than relying on Warden to set resource limits automatically
   using ulimit, you can use the following procedure to set the limits
   manually.
    1. Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-session* files to make sure the
       following entry is present:
# end of pam-auth-update config
session       required       pam_limits.so
    2. Use ulimit to verify settings.
    3. Reboot the system.
    4. Run the following command as the MapR user (not root) at a command
       line: ulimit -n
