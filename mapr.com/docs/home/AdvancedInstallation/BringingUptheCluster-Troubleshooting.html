Troubleshooting Installation

   If you are having difficulty bringing up the cluster, you have a number
   of options.

   Difficulty bringing up the cluster seems daunting, but most cluster
   problems are easily resolved. For the latest support tips, visit the
   [1]MapR Converge Community.
     * Can each node connect with the others? For a list of ports that
       must be open, see [2]Ports Used by MapR.
     * Is the [3]Warden service running on each node? On the node, run the
       following command as root:
$ service mapr-warden status
WARDEN running as process 18732
       If the Warden service is not running, check the Warden log file,
       /opt/mapr/logs/warden.log, for clues. To restart the Warden
       service:
$ service mapr-warden start
     * The ZooKeeper service is not running on one or more nodes:
          + Check the Warden log file for errors related to resources,
            such as low memory
          + Check the Warden log file for errors related to user
            permissions
          + Check for DNS and other connectivity issues between ZooKeeper
            nodes
     * The MapR CLI program /opt/mapr/bin/maprcli won't run
          + Did you [4]configure this node?
     * Instance Mismatch Node Alarm is raised
          + Restart Warden to ensure that the number of MapR Filesystem
            instances is as configured.
     * Permission errors appear in the log
          + Check that MapR changes to the following files have not been
            overwritten by automated configuration management tools:

   CAPTION:

            /etc/sudoers
            Allows the mapr user to invoke commands as root
            /etc/security/limits.conf
   Allows MapR services to increase limits on resources such as memory,
   file handles, threads and processes, and maximum priority level
            /etc/udev/rules.d/99-mapr-disk.rules
            Covers permissions and ownership of raw disk devices

   Before contacting MapR Support, you can collect your cluster's logs
   using the [5]mapr-support-collect script.
