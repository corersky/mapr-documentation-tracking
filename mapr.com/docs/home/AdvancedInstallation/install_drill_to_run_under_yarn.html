Install Drill to Run Under YARN

   As of Drill 1.8, you can install and configure Drill to run under YARN.
   See [1]Drill-on-YARN Overview. If you are currently running Drill under
   Warden, back up the directory from your previous Drill installation,
   and migrate Drill to run under YARN. See [2]Migrate Drill to Run Under
   YARN.
   Note: Drill-on-YARN is an advanced feature used to manage a production
   Drill cluster. Only skilled Drill and MapR administrators, familiar
   with YARN, should configure Drill to run under YARN. If you are new to
   Drill, consider using Drill under Warden until you are familiar with
   Drill and the Drill cluster.
   Note: The MapR default security feature introduced in MapR 6.0 is not
   supported with Drill-on-YARN.

   Verify that your system meets the prerequisites below and then follow
   the instructions in [3]Installing Drill to Run Under YARN to install
   the mapr-drill-yarn package on the node designated as the Drill-on-YARN
   client to run Drill under YARN.

Prerequisites

   Verify that your system meets the following prerequisites before you
   install Drill to run under YARN:
     * The MapR cluster is installed and running. Installing Drill first
       can result in configuration issues
     * You have planned the YARN cluster. See [4]YARN, [5]Planning the
       Cluster, and [6]Example Cluster Designs.
     *
          + ResourceManager is installed on one node in the YARN cluster,
            and you have calculated disk requirements for the YARN
            ResourceManager.
          + NodeManager is installed on all nodes in the YARN cluster.
     * You have designated one node to act as the Drill-on-YARN client.
       This is the node on which you install the mapr-drill-yarn package.
       The Drill-on-YARN client is a command-line program that starts,
       stops, and monitors the Drill cluster. The client provides the
       information that YARN needs to start the Application Master.
     * Cluster resources can accommodate the Drill memory, CPU, and disk
       requirements.
     * The MEP repository is configured. For instructions, see [7]Step 8:
       Install Ecosystem Components Manually.

Hive and HBase Support

   Installation of a supported version of Hive and HBase is optional.
   Support differs, depending on the MapR Expansion Pack version that you
   install. See [8]MEP Components and OS Support.
