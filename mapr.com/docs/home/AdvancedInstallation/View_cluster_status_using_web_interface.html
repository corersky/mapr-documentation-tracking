Viewing the Cluster Installation Status Using the Web Interface

   Compare your cluster plan to what each service is running.
    1. Log in to the MapR Control System (MCS) using the host name of the
       node where you installed the mapr-webserver.
       Note: Because MapR Monitoring has not been installed yet and MCS
       relies on MapR Monitoring for metrics collection, some MCS
       functions will not be available, but you can still use MCS to check
       the cluster services.
    2. Click the Nodes tab to verify that all nodes are present and
       healthy (no alarms are present).
    3. Click the Services tab to check for any stopped or failed services.
