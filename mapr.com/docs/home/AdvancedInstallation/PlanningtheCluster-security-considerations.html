Security Considerations

   Planning for security will help you identify security shortcomings and
   address them before you go into production.

   MapR 6.0 and later releases provide [1]built-in security. If your
   cluster is not already secure, the MapR Converged Data Platform
   supports many different levels of security. For more information, see
   [2]Getting Started with MapR Security.

   If the cluster you are planning to install must communicate with other
   clusters, the clusters should have similar security attributes. Mixing
   secure and nonsecure clusters is not recommended. For more information,
   see [3]Setting Up Cross-Cluster Security.
