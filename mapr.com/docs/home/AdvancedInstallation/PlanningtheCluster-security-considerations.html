Security Considerations

   Planning for security will help you identify security shortcomings and
   address them before you go into production.

   MapR 6.0 and later releases provide [1]built-in security. If your
   cluster is not already secure, the MapR Converged Data Platform
   supports many different levels of security. For more information, see
   [2]Getting Started with MapR Security.

   Before installing MapR software using the published packages, make sure
   that you have reviewed the list of known vulnerabilities in [3]Security
   Vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability applies to your release, contact
   your MapR support representative for a fix, and apply the fix
   immediately, if applicable.

   If the cluster you are planning to install must communicate with other
   clusters, the clusters should have similar security attributes. Mixing
   secure and nonsecure clusters is not recommended. For more information,
   see [4]Setting Up Cross-Cluster Security.
