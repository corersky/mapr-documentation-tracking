Installing Impala

   Impala is comprised of a set of components that you install and run on
   a single node or on multiple nodes in a cluster. To run Impala in your
   cluster, you install the required Impala packages on designated nodes.
   The Impala packages contain the following Impala components:
     * Impala daemon
     * Impala statestore
     * Impala catalog
     * Impala binaries

   The following table lists the Impala packages and their descriptions:
