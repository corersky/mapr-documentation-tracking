Installing Metering Using the MapR Installer

   This section describes how to install Metering by using the MapR
   Installer.
   Metering is part of the mapr-apiserver package and is installed by
   default when you use the [1]MapR Installer to install MapR 6.1 or
   later. Metering requires a minimal level of metrics collection to be
   enabled. On the Monitoring page of the MapR Installer web interface,
   you can choose between two configuration options for metrics
   collection:
     * A "full collection configuration" installs collectd on all nodes in
       the cluster with a configuration suitable for monitoring all
       available node metrics. This configuration is the default setting.
     * A "minimum collection configuration" installs collectd on all nodes
       in the cluster with a configuration suitable for supporting
       metering metrics collection (but not MapR Database table metrics).
       Note that when you choose this option, table metrics are not
       visible in the MapR Control System.

   For more information about Metering, see [2]Metering. To get started
   using the MapR Installer, see [3]MapR Installer.
