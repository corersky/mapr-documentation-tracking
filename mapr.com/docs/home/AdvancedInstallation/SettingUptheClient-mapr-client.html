MapR Client

   Describes how to install the MapR client to run Hadoop commands, jobs,
   and applications from a client machine.

   Use the MapR client to submit MapReduce applications, to submit YARN
   applications, and to run [1]hadoop fs, and [2]hadoop mfs commands.

   The method that you use to submit the Hadoop commands on Mac and
   Windows clients is different from the method that is used on Linux
   machines. See [3]Running Hadoop Commands on a Mac and Windows Client.
