MapR Installer Containers

   This section describes how you can obtain the MapR Installer as a
   Docker container.
   A MapR Installer container is a Docker container that contains the MapR
   Installer. You can use a MapR Installer container to perform basic
   installer operations from a node that is not necessarily a part of a
   MapR cluster. For example, from a MapR Installer container, you can
   perform the following actions:
     * Start and run the web-based MapR Installer to install a new
       cluster, apply a patch, or perform an update.
     * Run [1]MapR Installer Stanza commands to probe an installed
       cluster.

   You can create your own MapR Installer container by using the
   mapr-setup.sh script. Or you can download a pre-built container image
   for the MapR Installer.
