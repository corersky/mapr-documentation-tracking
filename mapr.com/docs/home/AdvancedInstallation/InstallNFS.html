Installing MapR NFS

   You can install NFSv3 on a node. The following sections describe how to
   install the NFSv3 server and the NFS client.

Installing MapR NFSv3 Server

   Install NFSv3 server package.
   To install, run the following command:
   Red Hat or CentOS
yum install mapr-nfs

   Ubuntu
apt-get install mapr-nfs

   SUSE
zypper install mapr-nfs

   If NFS server is installed without fileserver on a node, the node will
   be in /nfsserver topology. If fileserver is installed at a later time,
   the node will be moved to /data topology, which is the default for
   fileserver nodes.

Installing NFS Client

   To install NFS client, run the following command:
   Red Hat or CentOS
sudo yum install nfs-utils

   Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install nfs-common

   SUSE
sudo zypper install nfs-client
