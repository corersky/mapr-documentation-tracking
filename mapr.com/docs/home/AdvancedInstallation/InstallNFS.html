Installing MapR NFS

   You can install NFSv3 on a node. The following sections describe how to
   install the NFSv3 server, NFSv4 server, and the NFS client.

Installing MapR NFSv3 Server

   Install NFSv3 server package.
   To install, run the following command:
   Red Hat or CentOS
yum install mapr-nfs

   Ubuntu
apt-get install mapr-nfs

   SUSE
zypper install mapr-nfs

   If NFS server is installed without fileserver on a node, the node will
   be in /nfsserver topology. If fileserver is installed at a later time,
   the node will be moved to /data topology, which is the default for
   fileserver nodes.

Installing MapR NFSv4 Server

   The MapR NFSv4 server can only be installed on MapR 6.1 or later
   clusters. Both NFSv4 and NFSv3 servers cannot run on the same node. If
   you have NFS client running on an edge node, you can use that client to
   connect to MapR NFS server on clusters running either 5.2, where NFSv3
   server can be installed, or 6.1, where NFSv4 or NFSv3 can be installed.
    1. Download, if necessary, and install the nfs-utils package, if it is
       already not installed, on the host where you plan to install the
       NFSv4 server.
    2. Modify the /etc/yum.repos.d/mapr_ecosystem.repo file on CentOS/Suse
       or /etc/apt/sources.list file on Ubuntu to add the following:
          + CentOS:
[mapr-dev-ecosystem]
name=mapr-dev-ecosystem
baseurl=http://artifactory.devops.lab/artifactory/eco-rpm/releases/opensource/re
dhat
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
          + Ubuntu:
deb http://artifactory.devops.lab/artifactory/eco-deb binary trusty
#opensource.repo
    3. Ensure that rpc.statd is running on the node.
       To verify, run the following command:
# ps -ef| grep rpc.st
rpcuser 18889 1 0 01:04 ? 00:00:00 /sbin/rpc.statd
root 27016 6933 0 01:25 pts/0 00:00:00 grep color=auto rpc.st
       If it is already not running, execute the following to start it:
# /sbin/rpc.statd
    4. Install NFSv4 server package.
       To install, run the following command:

       Red Hat or CentOS
yum install mapr-nfs4server

       Ubuntu
apt-get install mapr-nfs4server

       SUSE
zypper install mapr-nfs4server

       The mapr-nfsganesha package is also installed as a dependency
       package. If NFS server is installed without fileserver on a node,
       the node is in /nfsserver topology. If fileserver is installed at a
       later time, the node is moved to /data topology, which is the
       default for fileserver nodes.
    5. Run [1]configure.sh utility with the -u and -g options to configure
       the services to run under user mapr and the group of the mapr user.
       Important: This step is required only if you are configuring NFSv4
       server to work with Kerberos.

Installing NFS Client

   To install NFS client, run the following command:
   Red Hat or CentOS
sudo yum install nfs-utils

   Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install nfs-common

   SUSE
sudo zypper install nfs-client

   Note: NFSv3 clients cannot connect to NFSv4 server because NFSv4 server
   only supports v4 protocol.
