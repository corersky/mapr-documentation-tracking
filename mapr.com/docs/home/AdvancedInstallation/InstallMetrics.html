Step 8: Install Metrics Monitoring

   To enable [1]metering and the display of certain metrics by the MapR
   Control System (MCS), you must install collectd and OpenTSDB
   components. Metrics monitoring is part of MapR Monitoring, which also
   includes log monitoring. MapR Monitoring components are available as
   part of the MapR Ecosystem Pack (MEP) that you selected for the
   cluster.

   Complete these steps to install metrics monitoring as the root user or
   using sudo. Installing metrics monitoring components on a client node
   or edge node is not supported.
    1. For metrics monitoring, install the following packages:

   CAPTION:

   Component Requirements
   collectd Install the mapr-collectd package on each node in the MapR
   cluster.
   OpenTSDB and AsyncHBase Install the mapr-opentsdb on one or more nodes.
   To allow failover of metrics storage when one OpenTSDB node is
   unavailable, install OpenTSDB on at least three nodes in the cluster.

   Note: mapr-opentsdb depends on mapr-asynchbase, and mapr-asynchbase is
   automatically installed on the node where you install mapr-opentsdb.
   Grafana Optional: Install the mapr-grafana package on at least one node
   in the MapR cluster. Grafana does not need to be installed for metering
   and is optional for metrics monitoring in general.
       On a three node cluster, you could run the following commands to
       install metrics packages:
          + For CentOS/RedHat:
               o Node A: yum install mapr-collectd mapr-grafana
               o Node B: yum install mapr-collectd mapr-opentsdb
               o Node C: yum install mapr-collectd
          + For Ubuntu:
               o Node A: apt-get install mapr-collectd mapr-grafana
               o Node B: apt-get install mapr-collectd mapr-opentsdb
               o Node C: apt-get install mapr-collectd
          + For SUSE:
               o Node A: zypper install mapr-collectd mapr-grafana
               o Node B: zypper install mapr-collectd mapr-opentsdb
               o Node C: zypper install mapr-collectd
    2. MapR 6.0.1 and later: Configure a password for Grafana:
          + For a secured cluster, ensure that the
            /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore.pem file is present in
            /opt/mapr/conf on the Grafana nodes. If the
            /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore.pem file is not present, you
            must copy it from the CLDB master node to /opt/mapr/conf on
            the Grafana nodes.
            Note: In a secure cluster, Grafana uses PAM to authenticate
            using the cluster administrator login ID (typically the mapr
            user ID) and password, so no additional information is needed.
          + For a nonsecured cluster, you must configure a password for
            the Grafana admin user ID at the time of running configure.sh.
            If no password is provided, the password reverts to admin,
            which is the default pre-MEP 5.0.0 password. Use one of the
            following methods to pass the password to Grafana:
               o On the nodes where Grafana is installed, export the
                 password as an environment variable before calling
                 configure.sh:
export GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD="<newGrafanaPassword>"
                 Then run configure.sh as you normally would run it (go to
                 step 3).
               o Add the following options to the configure.sh command in
                 step 3. This method explicitly passes the password on the
                 configure.sh command line:
-EPgrafana '-password <newGrafanaPassword>'
               o Add the following options to the configure.sh command in
                 step 3. This method explicitly passes the password on the
                 configure.sh command line by specifying a file:
-EPgrafana '-password <name of local file containing new password>'
    3. On every cluster node, run configure.sh with the -R and -OT
       parameters, and other parameters, as needed, for the Grafana
       password. A Warden service must be running when you use
       configure.sh -R -OT.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R -OT <comma-separate list of OpenTSDB nodes>

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   -R After initial node configuration, specifies that configure.sh should
   use the previously configured ZooKeeper and CLDB nodes.
   -OT Specifies a comma-separated list of host names or IP addresses that
   identify the OpenTSDB nodes. The OpenTSDB nodes can be part of the
   current MapR cluster or part of a different MapR cluster. The list is
   in the following format:
          + hostname/IP address[:port_no] [,hostname/IP
            address[:port_no]...]

   Note: The default OpenTSDB port is 4242. If you want to use a different
   port, specify the port number when you list the OpenTSDB nodes.
       For example, to configure MapR Monitoring components you can run
       one of the following commands:
          + In this example, default ports are used for the OpenTSDB
            nodes.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R -OT NodeB
          + In this example, non-default ports are specified for the
            OpenTSDB nodes:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R -OT NodeB:4040
          + If you are installing metrics monitoring only for use with the
            Metering utility, you can use the â€‘EPcollectd option to
            collect only metering metrics and omit database metrics. See
            [2]Installing Metering Using Manual Steps.
       After you run configure.sh -R, if errors are displayed see
       [3]Troubleshoot MapR Monitoring Installation Errors.
    4. To start collecting metrics for the NodeManager and ResourceManager
       services, restart these services on each node where they are
       installed.
maprcli node services -name nodemanager -nodes <space separated list of hostname
/IPaddresses> -action restart

maprcli node services -name resourcemanager -nodes <space separated list of host
name/IPaddresses> -action restart
