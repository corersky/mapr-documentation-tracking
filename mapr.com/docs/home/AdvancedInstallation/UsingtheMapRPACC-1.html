About the MapR Persistent Application Client Container (PACC)

   This container gives you seamless access to MapR Converged Data
   Platform services.

   This topic introduces the MapR PACC, including its function, benefits,
   components, and applications.

   The MapR Persistent Application Client Container (PACC) is a
   Docker-based container image that includes a container-optimized MapR
   client. The PACC provides seamless access to MapR Converged Data
   Platform services, including MapR-FS, MapR-DB, and MapR-ES. The PACC
   makes it fast and easy to run containerized applications that access
   data in MapR.

FUSE POSIX Client for File-Based Applications

   To support persistent, file-based applications, the MapR PACC includes
   a FUSE-based MapR POSIX Client, optimized for containers, that allows
   app servers, web servers, and other applications to read and write data
   directly to MapR-FS. If your cluster has a MapR POSIX Client for
   Containers license, the PACC can connect with MapR 5.1 or later
   clusters.

   Traditionally, all file data created by containers is lost when a
   container is terminated, which can happen during an application or
   hardware failure. By using the POSIX client within the PACC,
   applications can reliably persist file data directly to MapR-FS, where
   it can be re-attached to the container in the event of application or
   hardware failure.
   Note: Starting in MapR 5.2.1, each MapR cluster contains 10 free
   licenses for using the FUSE-based POSIX client with MapR PACC for
   development purposes only.

Support for Microservice Applications

   To support stateful microservice applications, the MapR PACC also
   contains a container-optimized version of the MapR client, which
   includes libraries for accessing MapR-DB and MapR-ES.

Secure Access

   The MapR PACC is designed to provide access to a secure cluster for all
   MapR Converged Platform data services. Users can pass a MapR ticket
   file into the container at runtime. All data access, whether to
   MapR-FS, MapR-DB, or MapR-ES, is authorized and audited according to
   the authenticated identity of the ticket file.

Pre-Built and User-Created Images

   To get started with the MapR PACC, you can take advantage of pre-built
   Docker images or create your own images to include site-specific
   environmental parameters:
