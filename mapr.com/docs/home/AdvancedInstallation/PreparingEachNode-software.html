Software

   In order to run MapR software and Hadoop, you must install certain
   software on your node.

Java

   MapR core requires the Java Development Kit (JDK). Installing only the
   Java runtime environment (JRE) is not sufficient. Verify that one of
   the following JDK versions is installed on the node:

   Java Requirements for MapR Core

          + Sun Java JDK 1.8
          + OpenJDK 1.8

          Note: Make sure you have the development kit installed. Some JRE
          packages include jdk in the name, but do not provide the
          required JDK software.

   Special Requirements for Using OpenJDK
          If you use OpenJDK:

          + RedHat/CentOS must have java-<version>-openjdk-devel
            installed.
          + SUSE nodes must have java-<version>-openjdk-devel installed.
          + Ubuntu nodes must have openjdk-<version>-jdk installed.

   Note: The openjdk-devel package and openjdk-8-jdk package include the
   jps command that lists running Java processes and can show whether the
   CLDB has started. This command is not supported in the Sun Java JRE.

   To install the Oracle/Sun Java JDK:
          Obtain the Oracle/Sun Java Development Kit (JDK), available at
          [1]Oracle's Java SE website. Find Java SE 8 in the archive of
          previous versions.

   To install or update OpenJDK
          Use a package manager, such as yum (RedHat, Oracle Linux, or
          CentOS), apt-get (Ubuntu) or zypper (SUSE).

          + On RedHat, Oracle Linux, or CentOS:
# yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
          + On Ubuntu:
# apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
          + SUSE
# zypper install java-1_8_0-openjdk-devel
