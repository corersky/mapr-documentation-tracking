Online vs. Offline Operations

   Most MapR Installer operations are offline operations, meaning that the
   cluster must be brought down in order to perform the operation. But
   there are some exceptions.
   The following table shows which MapR Installer operations are offline
   and online:
   Offline Operations Online Operations
   [1]Upgrading MapR Core With the MapR Installer [2]Using the Incremental
   Install Function*
   [3]Performing a Maintenance Update [4]Extending a Cluster by Adding
   Nodes**
   [5]Applying a Patch Using the MapR Installer
   [6]Using the Enable MapR Secure Cluster Option

   *Using the Incremental Install function to apply a patch or change
   security settings is an offline operation.

   **Adding a node to a CONTROL group requires a manual, rolling restart
   of the entire cluster.
