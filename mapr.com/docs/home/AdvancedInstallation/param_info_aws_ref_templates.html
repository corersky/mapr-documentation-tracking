Parameter Information for AWS Reference Templates

   This table describes the parameters in the MapR reference templates for
   AWS. Note that different templates can display different parameters and
   may present the parameters in a different order.
   Parameter Do this . . .
   Stack name Specify the stack name. MapR resources in AWS are grouped
   together as a stack that you create and delete as a single unit. The
   stack name cannot contain spaces.
   keyName Enter the key pair that you configure in [1]Creating a Key
   Pair.
   IAMInstanceProfile Enter the role you created in [2]Creating a Role for
   the MapR Installer.
   clusterName Enter a name for the cluster.
   clusterAdminPassword Enter the password you will use to log into MCS or
   the MapR Installer. This is the password for the UID mapr.
   Note: For cloud deployments, the installer uses the Cluster Admin
   Password as the MySQL root password when it creates a MySQL database
   for certain services that require a database.
   clusterAdminPasswordConfirm Enter the clusterAdminPassword again for
   verification.
   MEP Select the MapR Expansion Pack version.
   provisioningTemplate Select from the list of auto-provisioning
   templates. For more information about the templates, see
   [3]Auto-Provisioning Templates. Some offerings are preconfigured for
   provisioning and might not display this parameter.
   nodeCount Specify the number of nodes in the cluster.
   amiID Specify the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID. Leave this field empty
   to use a default AMI.
   sshUser Specify the ssh user with sudo privilege for the AMI you
   specified in amiID.
   instanceType Select from the list of AWS instance types. MapR
   CloudFormation templates support the following instance types:
     * m4.xlarge, m4.2xlarge, m4.4xlarge, m4.10xlarge, m4.16xlarge
     * m3.xlarge, m3.2xlarge
     * c4.2xlarge, c4.4xlarge, c4.8xlarge
     * c3.2xlarge, c3.4xlarge, c3.8xlarge
     * r4.large, r4.xlarge, r4.2xlarge, r4.4xlarge, r4.8xlarge
     * r3.large, r3.xlarge, r3.2xlarge, r3.4xlarge, r3.8xlarge
     * p2.xlarge
     * g2.8xlarge
     * Local Storage Instances (Use only local disks, not EBS)
     * i3.large, i3.xlarge, i3.2xlarge, i3.4xlarge, i3.8xlarge
     * d2.xlarge, d2.2xlarge, d2.4xlarge, d2.8xlarge

   For more information about instance types, see [4]Amazon EC2 Instance
   Types.
   useInstanceStore Set this value to true if the machine type supports
   instance stores (ephemeral disks) and you want to use only those disks.
   No EBS volumes will be attached.
   Note: This field is enabled for d2.* and i3.* instance types. i3.* uses
   NVMe disks, which are added by default in AWS. If you use i3.* images,
   the option is implicitly true.
   diskCount Specify the disks per node.
   diskType Specify the disk type. For more information, see [5]Amazon EBS
   Volume Types.
   diskSize Specify the disk size.
   installerOnItsOwn Select true to configure the MapR Installer on a node
   that is not part of the cluster. When you select true, the installer is
   started on a t2.small instance. Select false to configure the installer
   on a node in the cluster. Note that if you select true, the cluster
   will consist of the nodeCount plus another node for the installer.
   useExistingSubnet Specify a subnet ID if you want to use an existing
   subnet. Leave this field empty if you would like a new BPC and subnets
   created. If you choose to use your own subnet:
     * The subnet must have access to the Internet. Hosts on that subnet
       must have transparent outbound access to the Internet with no
       additional configuration required. This means either an automatic
       VPN or public IP addresses. The system will connect to the Internet
       to update packages and software.
     * The subnet must be able to communicate to all hosts within the
       subnet on all ports.
     * You must have a mechanism to connect with the hosts on the subnet.

   securityGroups Specify the security group IDs for an existing subnet if
   you specified a subnet ID for useExistingSubnet. Leave this field empty
   to create a new VPC and subnets.
   installOpenVPN Select True if you want to install OpenVPN. For more
   information, see [6]Using OpenVPN.
   openVPNuser Specify a user name for OpenVPN if you will use OpenVPN to
   connect to the cluster. For more information, see [7]Using OpenVPN.
   openVPNpassword Specify a password for OpenVPN if you will use OpenVPN
   to connect to the cluster. For more information, see [8]Using OpenVPN
   assignPublicIP If you want to assign a public IP address to each node,
   set this value to true. If you set the value to false, you must ensure
   that you have a way to connect to the private IP addresses.
   Note: It is recommended that you enable assignPublicIP if you are not
   using your own subnet, and you are letting the template create the VPC
   and subnet.
   publicAccess CIDR If you want to restrict the IP address from which the
   stack can be accessed, specify the IP address range in this field. This
   field applies only when the template creates the VPC and subnets.
