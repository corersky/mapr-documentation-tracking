Creating a MapR PACC Image Using mapr-setup.sh

   This section describes how to download and run the mapr-setup.sh script
   to create a MapR-PACC image.

   To create a MapR PACC image using mapr-setup.sh:
    1. Before using mapr-setup.sh, review these topics to understand
       important prerequisites and security considerations:
          + [1]Before Deploying the MapR PACC
          + [2]Security Considerations for the MapR PACC
    2. Download the mapr-setup.sh script from [3]mapr.com to a Linux or
       Mac OS X platform where Docker 1.12.5 or later is installed.
       Note: Running mapr-setup.sh on Windows is not supported.
    3. Run the mapr-setup.sh script with the docker client command to
       create the Docker image:
./mapr-setup.sh docker client
    4. Answer the command-line prompts to provide the information needed
       to configure the image. The following table describes each prompt.
       If you press Enter without specifying a value, mapr-setup.sh uses
       the default value shown in the square brackets ([]):

   Parameter Notes
   Build MapR client image? (y/n) [y] Press y to continue or n to exit the
   script.
   Image OS class (centos7, ubuntu16) [<local OS>]: Specify the base
   operating system on which to build the image.

   Note: SUSE is not currently supported.
   Docker FROM base image name:tag [centos:centos7]: Specify the starting
   image used to create the new image. If necessary, you can enter your
   own tag and image name to choose a base image already created for your
   installation.
   MapR core version [6.x.x]: Specify the MapR core version that matches
   the version of the MapR cluster you want to access using the PACC. For
   the supported MapR core values, see Table 1 in [4]Extending a MapR
   PACC. If you want to install the Hadoop Client with YARN, you must
   select 5.2.1 or later.
   MapR MEP version [x.x.x]: Specify the MEP version that matches the MEP
   version of the MapR cluster you want to access using the PACC.
   Supported values are 2.0 or later. If you want to install the Hadoop
   Client with YARN, you must select MEP 3.0 or later. For more
   information about MEPs, see [5]MEP Components and OS Support.
   Install Hadoop YARN client (y/n) [n]: Choose whether to install the
   Hadoop Client with YARN. Note that the Hadoop Client with YARN requires
   MapR core version 5.2.1 and MEP 3.0 or later. If you choose No, the
   script installs the POSIX (FUSE), MapR Database, and MapR Streams
   clients. The script does not install the Hadoop Client with YARN and
   does not ask if you want to install the Hive, Pig, and Streams clients.
   Add POSIX (FUSE) client to container? (y/n) [y]: Choose whether to
   install the POSIX (FUSE) client.
   Add HBase client to container? (y/n) [n]: Choose whether to install the
   HBase client.
   Add Hive client to container? (y/n) [n]: Choose whether to install the
   Hive client.
   Add Pig client to container? (y/n) [n]: Choose whether to install the
   Pig client.
   Add Spark client to container? (y/n) [n]: Choose whether to install the
   Spark client.
   Add MapR Streams clients to container? (y/n) [y]: Choose whether to
   install the MapR Streams clients.
   MapR client image tag name [<name>]: Accept the software-provided name
   for the image, or provide your own name. This is the name you will use
   to run the image to create the MapR PACC. The script automatically
   provides a name. For example:
maprtech/pacc:6.0.0_4.0.0_centos7_yarn_fuse_hbase_hive_pig_streams

   Container network mode (bridge|host) [bridge]: Select the Docker
   network mode. For more information, see the [6]Docker documentation.
   Container memory: specify host XX[kmg] or 0 for no limit [0]: Specify
   the maximum amount of memory (in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes)
   that Docker allows the container to access. For example:
          + 2g
          + 4096m
          + 0

   Accepting the default (0), means there is no restriction on memory, and
   the container can use as much memory as the platform makes available.
    5. Press Enter after the last prompt. The script creates the image and
       notifies you of successful creation. For example:
        Complete!

        ...Success

        Stopped service mapr-posix-client-container

        Edit '/root/thinclient/docker_images/client/mapr-docker-client.sh' to se
t
       MAPR_CLUSTER and MAPR_CLDB_HOSTS and then execute it to start the contain
er
       mapr-setup.sh creates the mapr-docker-client.sh sample-run file and
       displays the location of the file:
Edit '/root/thinclient/docker_images/client/mapr-docker-client.sh' to set
MAPR_CLUSTER and MAPR_CLDB_HOSTS and then execute it to start the container
       mapr-docker-client.sh contains environment variables for the image
       and makes it easy for you to start the container.
    6. Edit the mapr-docker-client.sh script file. At a minimum, you must
       provide the MAPR_CLUSTER name and the MAPR_CLDB_HOSTS information.
       For example:
MAPR_CLUSTER=my.cluster.com
MAPR_CLDB_HOSTS=perfnode13[4-9].perf.lab
       You may wish to provide other values. You can:
          + Start the FUSE client by specifying the MAPR_MOUNT_PATH.
          + For a secure cluster, use a ticket by specifying a
            MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION. For more information about security
            parameters, see [7]Running the MapR PACC Using Docker.
          + For secure and non-secure clusters, follow security best
            practices by specifying these parameters:
               o MAPR_CONTAINER_USER
               o MAPR_CONTAINER_GROUP
               o MAPR_CONTAINER_UID
               o MAPR_CONTAINER_GID
          + Set environment variables, such as MAPR_CLASSPATH, MAPR_HOME,
            PATH, and others.
          + Set the container time zone by specifying MAPR_TZ. The default
            is UTC.
    7. Run the mapr-docker-client.sh file to start the container:
$ ./docker_images/client/mapr-docker-client.sh
       The script uses the current user name to create a user for cluster
       access. This user is created so that you can run your application
       as a MapR client user:
Testing for cluster user account...

Enter MapR cluster user name: robertjones

User 'robertjones' does not exist. Creating new cluster user account...

Enter 'robertjones' uid: 502
 Enter 'robertjones' group name: users
 Enter 'robertjones' password: <password>
...Success

    8. Use the docker ps and docker inspect commands to inspect the
       container:
$ docker ps
$ docker inspect <container-run-ID>
