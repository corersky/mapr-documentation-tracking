Configuring Storage

   This section describes how to format disks for cluster storage manually
   using disksetup.

   The [1]disksetup utility formats disks for use by the MapR cluster.
   disksetup removes all data from the specified disks. Make sure you
   specify the disks correctly, and back up any data that you want to
   save. If you are re-using a node that was used previously in another
   cluster, it is important to format the disks to remove all data from
   the old cluster. For more information about the utility, see
   [2]disksetup.
   Note: The disksetup script assumes that you have free, unmounted
   physical partitions or hard disks for use by MapR. To determine if a
   disk or partition is ready for use by MapR, see [3]Setting Up Disks for
   MapR.

disksetup and DARE

   If data-at-rest-encryption (DARE) is enabled, you must use a different
   set of steps for configuring storage using disksetup. See the
   appropriate subtopic in this section.
