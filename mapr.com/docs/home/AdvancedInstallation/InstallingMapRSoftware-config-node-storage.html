Configuring Storage on a Node

   Describes how to format disks for cluster storage manually using
   disksetup.
   Note: If you configured storage while using configure.sh to configure
   the nodes, you do not need to perform this step.

   The [1]disksetup utility formats disks for use by the MapR cluster.
   disksetup removes all data from the specified disks. Make sure you
   specify the disks correctly, and back up any data that you want to
   save. If you are re-using a node that was used previously in another
   cluster, it is important to format the disks to remove all data from
   the old cluster. For more information about the utility, see
   [2]disksetup.
   Note: The disksetup script assumes that you have free, unmounted
   physical partitions or hard disks for use by MapR. To determine if a
   disk or partition is ready for use by MapR, see [3]Setting Up Disks for
   MapR.

Manually Running disksetup

   You can create a text file that lists the disks and partitions for use
   by MapR on a node. Each line should list either a single disk or all
   applicable partitions on a single disk. When listing multiple
   partitions on a line, separate each partition with a space. For
   example:
/dev/sdb
/dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdc4
/dev/sdd

   In the following example, /tmp/disklist is a text file that lists the
   disks and partitions:
   Example
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup /tmp/disklist
