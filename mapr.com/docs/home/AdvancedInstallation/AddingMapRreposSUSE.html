Adding the MapR Repository on SUSE

   This section describes how to install the MapR internet repository.
    1. Change to the root user or use sudo.
    2. Use the following command to add the repository for MapR packages,
       replacing <version> with the version of MapR that you want to
       install:
zypper ar https://package.mapr.com/releases/v6.x.x/suse/ maprtech
    3. Use the following command to add the repository for MapR ecosystem
       packages: (See the MapR Release Notes for the correct paths for all
       past releases.)

    4. If your connection to the Internet is through a proxy server, you
       must set the http_proxy environment variable before installation:
http_proxy=http://<host>:<port>
              export http_proxy
    5. Update the system package index by running the following command:
zypper refresh
    6. MapR packages require a compatibility package in order to install
       and run on SUSE. Execute the following command to install the SUSE
       compatibility package:
zypper install mapr-compat-suse
