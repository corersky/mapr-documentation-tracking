Configuring Nodes without Security

   Describes how to configure all nodes without security during
   installation without the MapR Installer.
   Note: This step does not configure your cluster for enhanced security.
   If you want your cluster to be secure, do not perform this step. Go to
   [1]Enabling Wire-level Security.
   Run the configure.sh script with the following options on all nodes in
   the cluster:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -Z <Zookeeper_node_list> -C <CLDB_node_list> [-RM
<host>] [-HS <host>] [-L <logfile>] [-N <cluster name>] [-F <disk list>]

   where:
     * Both <Zookeeper_node_list> and <CLDB_node_list> have the form
       hostname[:port_no][,hostname[:port_no]...].
     * -N <cluster_name> can be specified if the cluster is not yet named.
