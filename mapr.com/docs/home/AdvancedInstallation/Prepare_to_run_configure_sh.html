Preparing to Run configure.sh

   Before you run configure.sh, collect the information that you need to
   run the script based on your requirements.
   The configure.sh script can configure a node for the first time or
   update existing node configurations. Therefore, it has [1]many
   configuration options that you can use.
     * Note the hostnames of the CLDB and ZooKeeper nodes. Optionally, you
       can specify the ports for the CLDB and ZooKeeper nodes as well. The
       default CLDB port is 7222. The default ZooKeeper port is 5181.
     * If a node in the cluster runs the HistoryServer, note the hostname
       for the HistoryServer. The HistoryServer node must be specified
       using the -HS parameter.
     * If one or more nodes in the cluster runs the ResourceManager, note
       the hostname or IP address for each ResourceManager node. Based on
       the version you install and your ResourceManager high availability
       requirements, you may need to specify the ResourceManager nodes
       using the -RM parameter. Starting in MapR 4.0.2, high availability
       for the ResourceManager is configured by default and does not need
       to be specified.
     * If mapr-fileserver is installed on a node, you can use configure.sh
       with the -F option to format the disks and set up partitions. The
       -F option allows you to create a text file that lists the disks and
       partitions for use by MapR on the node. configure.sh passes the
       file to the disksetup utility. Each line lists either a single disk
       or all applicable partitions on a single disk. When listing
       multiple partitions on a line, separate each partition with a
       space. For example:
/dev/sdb
/dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdc4
/dev/sdd
       Or you can manually run disksetup after you run configure.sh. See
       [2]Configuring Storage on a Node.
     * For a cluster node that is on a VM, use the --isvm parameter when
       you run configure.sh, so that the script uses less memory.
