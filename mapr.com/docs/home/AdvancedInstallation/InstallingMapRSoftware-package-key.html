Step 1: Install the MapR Package Key

   Before you install MapR packages, you must install the MapR package
   key.
   MapR packages are cryptographically signed. Before you can install MapR
   packages, you must install the MapR package key, maprgpg.key. Note: For
   SUSE only, you do not have to install the key because zypper allows
   package installation with or without the key.
   To install the MapR package key, issue the command appropriate for your
   Linux distribution:
     * CentOS/RedHat/Oracle Linux
rpm --import https://package.mapr.com/releases/pub/maprgpg.key
     * Ubuntu
wget -O - https://package.mapr.com/releases/pub/maprgpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
