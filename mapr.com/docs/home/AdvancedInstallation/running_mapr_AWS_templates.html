Running the MapR AWS Templates

   You can use this procedure to install a MapR cluster in AWS using one
   of the MapR reference templates. You can run the templates as is or
   modify them and provide the modified template as an input to this
   procedure.
    1. Sign in to the [1]AWS Management Console.
    2. Navigate to the CloudFormation console. The Stacks page is
       displayed.
    3. Click Create Stack.
    4. In the Choose a template section, select the option to upload a
       local template or specify the URL of a template on S3. For the
       locations of the MapR reference templates, see [2]About the MapR
       Reference Templates for AWS.
    5. Click Next. The MapR CloudFormation template is displayed.
    6. Fill in the parameter values. See [3]Parameter Information for AWS
       Reference Templates.
    7. Click Next. The Options section is displayed. MapR templates don't
       require any specific values in this section. However, in the
       Advanced subsection, for debugging purposes it can be useful to set
       Rollback on failure to No so that resources are not deleted in the
       event of failure.
    8. Click Next. The Review page allows you to review your selections.
       Click Previous if you need to change a selection.
    9. Otherwise, select I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might
       create IAM resources with custom names.
   10. Click Create to start the process of stack creation. The new stack
       is listed at the top of the CloudFormation console with a status of
       CREATE_IN_PROGRESS. Stack creation for a three-node cluster can
       take 15-20 minutes. Depending on the size of the cluster, stack
       creation can take longer in some cases. To view the status of stack
       creation, select the stack, and click the Events tab. You can
       expand the event message to see more information about an event.
       If there are errors during CloudFormation, see [4]CloudFormation
       Troubleshooting.
   11. When the stack creation status shows CREATE_COMPLETE, the stack is
       created. Click the Outputs tab to view the outputs. For example:

   12. If you are using an existing subnet, set up a secure connection to
       the subnet by using OpenVPN or other means. See [5]Using OpenVPN.
   13. Once you are connected, you can click the MaprInstallerUrl to start
       the installer. The installer status page shows links to resources
       you can use to get more information about the cluster.
