Installing or Upgrading MapR Core Using a MapR Installer Stanza

   Use the Stanza install command to install MapR 5.1 or later, install
   additional features, upgrade a cluster, perform a maintenance update,
   or apply a patch.
   You can use the install command of the MapR Installer Stanza command
   suite to:
     * Perform a fresh install of MapR 5.1 or later.
     * Perform an incremental install (add or upgrade services that are
       already installed on the cluster).
     * Upgrade a cluster to a newer MapR version or a newer MEP version.
     * Perform a [1]maintenance update.
     * Apply a patch (see [2]Applying a Patch Using a MapR Installer
       Stanza).
     * Extend the cluster by adding nodes (see [3]Extending a Cluster by
       Adding Nodes).

   For the install command syntax and options, see [4]MapR Installer
   Stanza Commands later in this section.
   This example installs MapR software using the parameters specified in
   the sample_basic.yaml Stanza file. To run this command, you should be
   logged in as the mapr user. The -nv option specifies that certificates
   will not be checked and the output mode is verbose. The -toption, which
   is required, specifies the use of a template file:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli install -nv -t ./examples/sample_basic.yaml

   If you are using a MapR Installer Stanza to install MapR software on a
   cluster that has never had MapR software installed (a fresh
   installation), it is recommended to create the mapr user on all nodes.
   You can create the mapr user by using the config.cluster_admin_password
   override. For example:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli install -nv -t ./examples/sample_basic.yaml -o config.c
luster_admin_password=mapr

   If you use the install command and an existing cluster is detected, the
   installer attempts an incremental install or upgrade using the
   parameters in the specified Stanza file:
     * For incremental installs, the installer does not check or verify
       the configuration.
     * You cannot add nodes or services during a version upgrade.

   Note: If the password in the Stanza file or in the command contains a
   special character, such as an exclamation point (!), you might need to
   escape the character with a backslash (\). For example:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli install -u mapr:mapr\!@localhost -nv -t ../examples/sam
ple_basic.yaml

   If you do not want to include a password in the Stanza file, you can
   specify a value contained in a secured file. This example uses a Stanza
   file (sample_nopwd.yaml) in which the ssh_password line has been
   removed. The secured file (installer.cfg) stores the value of
   ssh_password as config.ssh_password=mapr. The contents of installer.cfg
   are piped to the install command via an override (-o -). You must
   include the - after the -o; otherwise, the file contents are not read.
cat examples/installer.cfg | ./bin/mapr-installer-cli install -nv -t examples/sa
mple_nopwd.yaml -o -

   To check the progress of the installation or upgrade, see [5]Checking
   the Progress of Operations. For another example of using the install
   command, see [6]MapR Stanzas (blog).

New Installation of MapR 6.0 Secure Cluster Using Stanzas

   To install a MapR 6.0 secure cluster using Stanzas, you must add two
   parameters to the Stanza:
     * config.security: "true"
     * config.cluster_admin_password: "<mapr_user_password>"

   For example:
config:
  security: "true"
  cluster_admin_password: "mapr"

   After the installation completes, secure=true should be set in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file. This command should print the
   ticket details:
maprlogin print -ticketfile /opt/mapr/conf/mapruserticket

   Note these considerations for installing a MapR 6.0 secure cluster:
     * If you use a Stanza to perform a secure install, you must log out
       and then log in one time for the bashrc to take effect.
     * For non-bash environments, you must manually add the above epxort
       to your login profile.
     * You can use the probe command to detect whether a cluster is secure
       or not.
