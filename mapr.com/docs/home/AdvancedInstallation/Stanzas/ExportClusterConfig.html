Exporting a Cluster Configuration

   If a cluster was installed using the MapR Installer or a MapR Installer
   Stanza, you can use the export command to generate a Stanza that
   captures the state of the cluster. You can then modify the Stanza to
   perform incremental installs or upgrades.
   This example uses the export command to generate the tt.yaml Stanza
   file. The command includes -n so that certificates will not be checked:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli export -n --file /tmp/tt.yaml

   Note: The export command does not export the config.ssh_password field.
   When using the exported YAML file, you need to provide the password
   manually, pass it as an override, or specify a value contained in a
   secured file, as described in [1]Installing or Upgrading MapR Core
   Using a MapR Installer Stanza.

   For another example of using the export command, see [2]MapR Stanzas
   (blog).
