Shutting Down a Cluster Using a MapR Installer Stanza Command

   Use the Stanza shutdown command to shut down an on-premise or
   cloud-based cluster.

   The Stanza shutdown command is available with MapR Installer 1.6 or
   later. The command shuts down Warden and Zookeeper, which in turn shut
   down other running services that are part of a MapR cluster. When you
   use the shutdown command, the MapR Installer implements the same
   orderly shutdown that it uses to perform software upgrades.

   You must supply the ssh ID and password or the ssh ID and ssh_key_file.
   The shutdown command works differently for cloud-based clusters. Note
   these considerations for the behavior of the shutdown command:
   Cluster Location Shutdown Command Behavior
   On premise Does not stop non-MapR software and does not power off the
   nodes.
   In the cloud Shuts down (but does not remove) all the nodes in the
   cluster. If the installer node is part of the cluster, the installer
   node is not shut down. To shut down the installer node, use AWS-console
   or Azure-portal commands to stop the instance.

   This example shuts down a MapR cluster. The command uses an override to
   provide the ssh_id and ssh_password and includes -nv so that
   certificates will not be checked, and the output mode is verbose.
./bin/mapr-installer-cli shutdown -nv -o config.ssh-id=root -o config.ssh_passwo
rd=mapr

   This example shuts down a MapR cluster. The command uses an override to
   provide the ssh_id and ssh_key_file and includes -nv so that
   certificates will not be checked, and the output mode is verbose. The
   ssh_key_file for root normally resides in /root/.ssh. In this example,
   the file has been copied to /home/mapr/root so that the mapr user can
   access the key file.
./bin/mapr-installer-cli shutdown -nv -o config.ssh_id=root -o config.ssh_key_fi
le=/home/mapr/root_user_id_rsa
