Getting Information About Services and Groups

   Use the Stanza list command to get additional information about your
   cluster.

   You can use the list command and its arguments to get information about
   the configuration, services, groups, hosts, and services in the
   cluster. While the list command provides the state of the cluster, list
   output is not suitable for incremental installs and upgrades. You must
   use the export command if you want to generate a Stanza file that can
   be used for upgrading.
   This example displays a listing of all the services, groups, and hosts
   that were installed:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list installed -n

   This example lists all the groups:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list groups -n

   This example lists all the hosts:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list hosts -n

   This example lists the installation status for all the hosts:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list hosts_install_status -n -u https://mapr:<password>
@<installer_ip_addr>:9443

   This example lists the services by template:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list services -n --type TEMPLATE|more

   You can use the list services command to learn about different kinds of
   services. For example:
    Group Type   Example Command
   CONTROL
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list services -n --type CONTROL

   MULTI_MASTER
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list services -n --type MULTI_MASTER
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list services -n --type MONITORING_MASTER

   DATA
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list services -n --type DATA
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list services -n --type DEFAULT
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list services -n --type CLIENT

   SINGLE MASTER
./bin/mapr-installer-cli list services -n --type MASTER
