Verifying the Stanza File

   You can use the check command to verify the configuration portion of a
   Stanza file. The check command does not do any provisioning or
   installation.

   This example checks the configuration of the sample_advanced_demo.yaml
   file. The -nv option specifies that certificates will not be checked
   and the output mode is verbose. The -t option, which is required,
   specifies the use of a template file:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli check -nv -t sample_advanced_demo.yaml
