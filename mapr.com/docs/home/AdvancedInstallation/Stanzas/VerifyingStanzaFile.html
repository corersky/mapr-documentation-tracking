Verifying the Nodes

   You can use the check command to verify that the nodes specified in the
   Stanza file are ready to be installed. The check command does not check
   the Stanza file and does not do any provisioning or installation. The
   check command runs the same checks that the MapR Installer runs during
   its Verification phase. For example, it checks that the nodes have the
   right OS version, that they have enough disk space, and that they have
   enough memory to support installation or other Installer operations.

   This example verifies the nodes specified in the
   sample_advanced_demo.yaml file. The -nv option specifies that
   certificates will not be checked and the output mode is verbose. The -t
   option, which is required, specifies the use of a template file:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli check -nv -t sample_advanced_demo.yaml
