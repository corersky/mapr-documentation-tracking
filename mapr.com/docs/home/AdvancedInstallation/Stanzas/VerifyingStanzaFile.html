Verifying the Stanza File

   You can use the check command to verify the configuration portion of a
   Stanza file. The check command does not do any provisioning or
   installation. The check command generates the new.yaml file that
   contains information about the kinds of disks that are present on each
   node during a fresh install. This information could be used to perform
   an install with manual disk selection.

   This example checks the configuration of the sample_advanced_demo.yaml
   file. The -nv option specifies that certificates will not be checked
   and the output mode is verbose. The -t option, which is required,
   specifies the use of a template file:
./bin/mapr-installer-cli check -nv -t sample_advanced_demo.yaml
