Working with MapR Installer Stanza Files

   This topic describes how to use the sample Stanza files that are
   provided with the MapR Installer.

   The MapR Installer Stanza file specifies how the cluster should be
   configured, including the configuration of nodes, disks, software
   versions, and services. You must configure a Stanza file before using
   MapR Installer Stanzas to install or upgrade a cluster. Sample Stanza
   files (basic and advanced) are located in this directory:

   /opt/mapr/installer/examples
   To create your Stanza file:
    1. Make a copy of one of the sample files. For example, make a copy of
       the sample_basic or sample_advanced Stanza file, and rename the
       copy to a name of your choosing.
    2. Using any text editor, edit the Stanza file to address the needs of
       your installation. Comment out any instructions that you don't
       need.

   This table describes how to complete the fields in the Stanza file:
   Section Parameter Required/Optional Directions
   environment mapr_core_version Required Specify 5.1.0 or later. Be sure
   to include the third digit (for example, 5.1.0 or 5.2.0).
     patch_location Optional Specify the location of a MapR core patch
   file. The file name must use the format
   mapr-patch-$[mapr_core_version}. For example:
mapr-patch-5.2.0.39122.GA-4198.x86_64.rpm

   Use an absolute path to specify the patch file location.
   config hosts Required Specify the list of hosts on which you want to
   install packages. You can list the hosts on a single line as follows:
- examplenode[1-3].example.com

   Or you can use multiple lines:
- examplenode1.example.com
- examplenode2.example.com
- examplenode3.example.com

   Note:
     * The installer host must be one of the hosts in this list.
     * A comma-separated list of hosts is not supported.
     * You can override hosts and disks from the command line. The
       following example specifies installing only on hosts 01 through 04.
       To pass an array into an override, use single quotes, double
       quotes, and brackets as follows:
cli install -nv -t sample_adv.yaml -o config.hosts='["lab[01-04].yourlab.com"]'

   Note: In a command with an override, the key=value pair or pairs that
   follow -o must not contain a blank space. For more information about
   key=value pairs, see [1]MapR Installer Stanza Commands.
     ssh_id Required Specify the user ID that the installer will run under
   when it installs the packages. This user must have root access and must
   be present on every host defined in the hosts section.
     ssh_password Optional Specify the password (for use with the
   password-based login). This is the password that the installer uses to
   log into the node using ssh. Comment this line if you want to use a
   private-key-based login.
     ssh_key_file Optional Specify the path to a file that contains the
   private key (for use only with the private key-based login). Uncomment
   this line if you want to use a private-key-based login. If both the
   ssh_password and ssh_key_file lines are uncommented, the installer will
   default to the ssh_key_file.
     ssh_port Optional Uncomment this line if you need to specify a port
   other than the default, which is 22.
     license_type Required Specify M3 for the community edition or M5 for
   the enterprise edition.
     mep_version Required for MapR 5.2.0 and later Specify a currently
   supported MEP, such as 2.0. For MEP information, see [2]MEP Components
   and OS Support.
     disks Required List the disks on which the packages will be
   installed. The disk names should be the same on every node. This field
   is required, and you must use the following notation:
- /<diskname>
- /<diskname>
- /<diskname>

   A comma-separated list of disks is not supported. Not all of the disks
   need to be present, but at least one disk on each node must be present.
     disk_stripe Optional Uncomment this line if you need to specify a
   disk stripe value other than the default, which is 3.
     elasticsearch_path Optional Uncomment this line if you need to
   specify a path where elasticsearch data will be stored.
     services Optional Specify a predefined template of services. Services
   are the MapR core or ecosystem components (or tools) that run on each
   group. The installer configures default services automatically unless
   you specify a "groups" section in the Stanza file. To view the
   predefined templates, use the list command with the --type TEMPLATE
   argument.
   Note:
     * Metrics are provided by default. The metrics services apply only to
       MapR 5.2 and later.
     * Logging services, if specified, apply only to MapR 5.2 and later.
     * If you do not specify any services, the Installer will install only
       MapR Core services.
     * For an incremental install or upgrade, the Installer discovers any
       services already installed. Additional services are installed only
       if you request specific services, a MEP upgrade, or a MapR Core
       upgrade.
     * You can override services using a command such as the following:
-o config.services='{"mapr-oozie": {} , "mapr-hivemetastore":{"database": {"name
": "hive", "user": "hive", "password": "mapr"}}}'
     * In a command with an override, the string that follows -o must not
       contain a blank space.

   groups (advanced layout only)   Optional To provision the cluster
   manually, add services in groups. A group is a collection of hosts
   (nodes) that runs a specific set of services. The installer creates
   groups automatically unless you specify the groups manually (manual
   provisioning).

   To specify the groups manually, you must include a groups section and
   define the hosts, labels, and services that your cluster needs. For an
   example, see the sample_advanced Stanza file.

   The services you specify must not be of type GROUP. To view the type
   for a given service, use the list services command with the --name
   <name-of-service> argument.

   Also, when provisioning manually, you must ensure that the mapr-core
   service is present on every node.
     hosts Required (if a groups section is specified) Hosts are nodes
   that run a specific set of services.
     label Optional The label is a descriptor for each group. Use the
   label to describe the group function or some other aspect of the group
   that is meaningful to your installation. If a label is not specified,
   the installer will auto-generate a label based on the service names.
     services Required (if a groups section is specified) See the
   "Services" section earlier in this table.
