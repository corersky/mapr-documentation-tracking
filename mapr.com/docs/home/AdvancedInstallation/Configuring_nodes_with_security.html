Enabling Wire-level Security

   Describes how to enable wire-level security.

   Wire-level security encrypts data transmission between the nodes in
   your cluster.

   When you set up a cluster, run the [1]configure.sh script on each node
   that you want to add to the cluster.

Basic Procedure

   To enable wire-level encryption for the cluster, follow these steps in
   order:
    1. If the cluster is running, [2]shut it down.
    2. Delete the ssl_keystore, ssl_truststore, ssl_truststore.p12, and
       ssl_truststore.pem files on a machine where wire-level security is
       not enabled because the configure.sh script fails if you already
       have these files in the directory.
       Note: The ssl_keystore, ssl_truststore, ssl_truststore.p12, and
       ssl_truststore.pem files are generated during installation of the
       Web server even if you did not enable security.
       For example, to delete the files, run the following commands:
cd /opt/mapr/conf
/bin/rm -f ssl_keystore ssl_truststore ssl_truststore.p12 ssl_truststore.pem
       If you are re-running the script due to an invocation error from a
       previous run, the cldb.key and maprserverticket files may also have
       been created. Delete these files because the script fails if you
       already have these files in the directory. For example, run the
       following command to delete these files:
cd /opt/mapr/conf
/bin/rm -f cldb.key maprserverticket ssl_keystore ssl_truststore ssl_truststore.
p12 ssl_truststore.pem
    3. Run the configure.sh script with the -secure -genkeys options on
       the first CLDB node in your cluster:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -secure -genkeys -Z <Zookeeper_node_list> -C <CLDB
_node_list> -N <cluster_name>
       where both <Zookeeper_node_list> and <CLDB_node_list> have the form
       hostname[:port_no][,hostname[:port_no]...] and -N <cluster_name>
       specifies the cluster name.
       Important: You must run configure.sh -genkeys only once on one CLDB
       node, since the resulting files must be copied to other nodes.
       This command generates six files in the /opt/mapr/conf directory:
          + cldb.key
          + maprserverticket
          + ssl_keystore
          + ssl_truststore
          + ssl_truststore.p12
          + ssl_truststore.pem
    4. Copy the cldb.key file to any node that has the CLDB or Zookeeper
       service installed.
    5. Copy the maprserverticket, ssl_keystore, ssl_truststore,
       ssl_truststore.p12, and ssl_truststore.pem files to the
       /opt/mapr/conf directory of every node in the cluster.
    6. Verify that the files from the previous step are owned by the user
       that runs cluster services. This user is mapr by default. Also, the
       maprserverticket and ssl_keystore files must have their UNIX
       permission-mode bits set to 600, and the ssl_truststore,
       ssl_truststore.p12, and ssl_truststore.pem files must be readable
       to all users.
    7. Run configure.sh -secure on each existing node in the cluster using
       the same arguments as in Step 3 but without the -genkeys option.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -secure -Z <Zookeeper_node_list> -C <CLDB_node_lis
t> -N <cluster_name>
       The -secure option indicates that wire-level security must be
       enabled on the node where the command is run.
       Important: You must also do this on any nodes that you add to the
       cluster in the future.
    8. Copy the ssl_truststore, ssl_truststore.p12, and ssl_truststore.pem
       files to any client nodes outside the cluster.
       Important: If you run configure.sh -secure on a node before you
       copy the necessary files to that node, the command fails.
    9. Log in as the mapr superuser using the [3]maprlogin command:
       maprlogin password (in this command, password is literal text).
   10. Set the volume-level encryption flag (for the volumes whose traffic
       you wish to encrypt) using the [4]volume create or [5]volume modify
       command with the -wiresecurityenabled argument set to true.
   11. If clients will connect to multiple secure clusters, merge the
       ssl_truststore files with the /opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh
       tool. See [6]Setting Up the Client for more information on MapR
       clients.

Advanced Procedure

   In certain situations, you may opt for variant of the basic procedure.
   Such situations include, but are not limited to the following:
     * You are running the script on a host that is configured without a
       domain name.
     * You have a cluster where all the machines do not have the same
       domain name.
     * You wish to import your own custom certificates instead of the
       self-signed certificates generated by the configure.sh utility.

Running on Hosts with no Configured Domain Name

   When used without the -certdomain argument, the configure.sh script
   discovers the domain name of the node on which it is being executed
   using the hostname -d command and then creates a 100-year self-signed
   certificate using the PKCS#1 v1.5 with SHA-512 hash function
   (SHA512withRSA) with a wildcard certificate with the common name (CN)
   *.<domain>. For example, if hostname -d returns the domain name
   mycompany.com, then the CN of the certificate is *.mycompany.com. This
   certificate works for all machines within the mycompany.com domain and
   can therefore be copied to all cluster nodes as specified in Step 5 in
   the [7]Basic Procedure.

   Certificate generation fails if the host that you are running the
   script from is configured without a domain name. To fix this, modify
   your machine configuration so that hostname -d returns a non-empty
   string and then run the configure.sh script.

   Alternatively, re-run the script with the -certdomain option as shown
   in Step 3 of the [8]Basic Procedure:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -secure -genkeys -certdomain <domain_name> -Z <Zoo
keeper_node_list> -C <CLDB_node_list> [ -N <cluster_name> ]

Securing Clusters with Multiple Domain Names

   Generally, all machines within a cluster should belong to the same
   domain. In the unusual case where you have a cluster with different
   machines belonging to different domains, applications that perform
   hostname verification can fail if you run the configure.sh script (as
   described in Step 3 of the [9]Basic Procedure) to generate a
   single-domain wildcard certificate. In this case, you must provide your
   own multi-domain wildcard certificate and import the custom certificate
   into the keystore as described in [10]Importing a Certificate Authority
   Signed (CA Signed) SSL Certificate Into a MapR Cluster.

Using Custom Certificates

   To import your own custom certificates into the keystore instead of
   using the self-signed certificates, see [11]Importing a Certificate
   Authority Signed (CA Signed) SSL Certificate Into a MapR Cluster.
