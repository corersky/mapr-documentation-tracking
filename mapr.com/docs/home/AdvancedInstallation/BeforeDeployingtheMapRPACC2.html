Before Deploying the MapR PACC

   Perform a series of checks on the platform and MapR cluster before
   deploying the MapR PACC.

   Before you deploy a MapR PACC, or an application container based on the
   PACC, perform the following checks on the platform and MapR cluster.
   On the platform where you plan to deploy... On the MapR cluster...
     * Verify that Docker 1.12.5 or later is installed and the Docker
       daemon is up and running. For download instructions, see this
       [1]Docker website.
     * Verify that you have sufficient disk space for use by the
       container.
          + 1 GB for the pre-built images
          + 1.5 GB for the user-created images

     * If you plan to connect to MapR file system using the POSIX client,
       you must verify that you have a license for the MapR POSIX Client
       for Containers. No license is required to connect to MapR-DB or
       MapR-Streams. To obtain the license, do one of the following:
          + Clusters registered with the MapR Enterprise Trial license can
            connect unlimited POSIX Clients for Containers.
          + For production use of the POSIX Client for Containers, contact
            your MapR sales representative.
     * Obtain the information that you will use to set up the container.
       You need to gather:
          + The cluster name.
          + The time zone of the container. If no time zone is specified,
            the container uses UTC as the default time zone.
          + The IP addresses of the cluster nodes running the CLDB.
          + A ticket if you need to connect to a secure cluster.

Leveraging MapR-FS Storage for Application Persistence

   The data associated with containers is typically not persistent. If you
   specify a MapR mount path using MAPR_MOUNT_PATH, any data written to
   the mounted directory will be persisted to MapR file system. For
   example, you could create a symlink to the Apache log directory and
   persist all log files in MapR file system.

   If you specify a MapR mount path and if your hardware or application
   fails, re-launching the container in any location using the same Docker
   runtime environment variables will result in all pre-created data being
   available for use.

Security Considerations

   You should be aware of security considerations for secure and
   non-secure clusters when using MapR PACCs. See [2]Security
   Considerations for the MapR PACC.
