MapR Installer FAQ

   Review frequently asked questions about the MapR Installer.

General

   What is the difference between the MapR Installer and the Quick
          Installer?
          The MapR Installer is a robust, user-friendly replacement for
          the Quick Installer. You can use the MapR Installer to install a
          cluster with MapR services and ecosystem components. You can
          also use the MapR Installer to update an existing cluster with
          additional nodes, MapR services, and ecosystem components.
          However, the MapR Installer does not install the MapR client.

   Which versions of MapR can I install?
          You can use the MapR Installer to install MapR 4.1, 5.0, 5.1,
          5.2.x, and 6.x

   Can I use the MapR Installer to upgrade my cluster?
          Yes. The MapR Installer can be used to upgrade a cluster that
          was installed using the MapR Installer or a MapR Installer
          Stanza. See [1]Upgrading MapR Core With the MapR Installer for
          information about how to upgrade with the MapR Installer.

          If the cluster was manually installed, you can install the
          installer and enable it to be used with subsequent installations
          or upgrades by following the steps in [2]Using probe and import
          to Generate the Installer Database.

   Can I use the MapR Installer to install a patch?
          Yes. See [3]Applying a Patch.

Preparing to Install

   What are the MapR Installer requirements?
          See the [4]Prerequisites.

   What information should I be prepared with before I start?
          The mapr-setup.sh script requests the following information:

          + The hostname and port number that other nodes in the cluster
            can use to connect to the MapR Installer node.
          + A user for the MapR Admin user account. If the user account
            doesn't exist, the mapr-setup.sh script prompts for the UID,
            GID, group name, and password so that it can create the
            account.

          The MapR installer requests the following information:

          + The [5]MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) that you want to install on a
            5.2.x or later cluster
          + The MapR services that you want to install on the cluster
          + Hostnames of the nodes that you want to include in the cluster
          + Credentials for the root user or a user with sudo privileges
            on each node in the cluster

   What are the node requirements?
          See the [6]Prerequisites.

   What are my options if I don't want to use an Internet repository?
          See [7]Using a Local, Shared Repository With the MapR Installer.

   Can I install on nodes in the cloud?
          Yes. See [8]Installation Options.

Using the MapR Installer

   Which license edition applies to my installation?
          As of 5.1, MapR licenses are categorized by new editions and
          modules that further define the features supported by an
          edition.

          See the following table for descriptions of the new license
          options. For more information about licensing, see [9]MapR
          Software Licensing.

   License Edition Description
   Community Edition An unlimited, free, community-supported MapR edition
   with one free NFS Gateway. This edition includes Hadoop, MapR-DB, and
   MapR Event Store for Apache Kafka. However, real-time global
   replication of MapR-DB tables or MapR Event Store for Apache Kafka is
   not included.
   Enterprise Edition MapR Edition that enables enterprise-class features
   such as high availability, multi-tenancy, and disaster recovery. Each
   of the following modules for the Enterprise Edition unlocks a portion
   of the total platform capabilities:

        Analytics
                Enables enterprise-class features for analytic use cases,
                such as highly-available NFS and support for services like
                YARN and MapReduce.

        Database
                Enables enterprise-class features for operational NoSQL
                database, with MapR-DB JSON and binary tables, and
                real-time global database replication.

        Streams
                Enables enterprise-class features for publish/subscribe
                event streaming, with MapR Event Store for Apache Kafka
                and real-time global stream replication.

   For more information about MapR editions, see [10]What's Included.

   What happened to the M3, M5, M7, or Enterprise Edition licenses?
          With the release of 5.1 and MapR Streams, the licensing model
          has been simplified, allowing more choice in which specific
          features are licensed on a cluster.

          See the following table to understand how the new MapR licenses
          correspond to the legacy license editions that you are familiar
          with. For more information about licensing, see [11]MapR
          Software Licensing. For more information about MapR editions,
          see [12]What's Included.

   Legacy Edition New Edition & Module(s)
   M3 or Community Edition Community Edition. Starting in 5.1, the
   Converged Community Edition includes MapR Streams.
   M5 or Enterprise Edition Enterprise Edition with Hadoop Module
   M7 or Enterprise Database Edition Enterprise Edition with Hadoop and
   Database modules

   What expressions can I use to specify multiple nodes?
          You can enter the following types of expressions to specify
          nodes:

          + [0-99] => Expands hostnames to 0, 1, 2, ...99. The second
            delimiter allows one or more digits.

          + [00-99] => Expands hostnames to 00,01,02,...99. Allows two or
            more digits of the same length

          + [a-z] or [A-Z] => Expands hostnames to a,b,c,...z or
            A,B,C,...Z

          To group hosts based on racks for performance or reliability,
          append ":" followed by the rack name to each expression.

          Examples:

          + host1, host2, host3
          + host[A-Z][0-99] => hostA0, hostA1, hostA2 ,...hostZ99
          + host[000-333] => host000, host001, host002, ... host333
          + host[0-3],otherhost[00-05] => host0, host1, host2,...host3 and
            otherhost00,...otherhost05
          + host[0-5]:rack1,host[6-10]:rack2 => host1, host2,
            host3,...host5 on rack1. host6, host7, host8,...host10 on
            rack2

   How do I change the service layout?
          The MapR Installer uses groups to organize nodes and services. A
          group is a set of services that you can run on one or more
          nodes. A service can only be assigned to one group.

          On the Configure Service Layout page, you can use the Advanced
          Configuration option to drag and drop services between existing
          groups to specify where the services are to be installed. You
          can also create new groups or change the list of nodes assigned
          to a group.

          Note: Some services can only be assigned to one node.

   Can I install a single-master service, such as Hive, on multiple nodes?
          When you use the MapR Installer, single-master services are
          added to the default MASTER group. By design, only one node can
          be assigned to the MASTER group.

          To install a single-master service on more than one node:

         1. On the Configure Service Layout page, create a new group.
         2. Assign multiple nodes to the new group.
         3. Drag the single-master service to the new group.

   Can I install a secure MapR cluster with the MapR Installer?
          Yes. MapR Installer [13]versions 1.7 and later support
          [14]built-in security.

   Are there limitations to what you can do when you update an existing
          cluster?
          See the restrictions documented in [15]Using the Incremental
          Install Function.

   How do I uninstall the MapR Installer?
          If the installer node is part of the cluster, the MapR Installer
          packages can remain on the installer node after the cluster is
          uninstalled.

          If you have uninstalled the cluster, you can run one of the
          following commands to uninstall the MapR Installer packages from
          the installer node:

          + On CentOS / Red Hat:
yum remove 'mapr-installer*'

          + On Ubuntu:
apt-get remove 'mapr-installer*'

          + On SUSE
zypper remove 'mapr-installer*'

Troubleshooting

   What can I do if I need to rerun mapr-setup.sh with a new repository
          URL and the script still points to the old URL?
          The /opt/mapr/installer/data/properties.json file stores
          information such as the user ID of the cluster administrator,
          the user ID of the MapR Installer, the OS type, Internet access
          information, and the repository URLs for MapR core and the
          ecosystem components. Once a repository URL has been stored in
          properties.json, the MapR Installer assumes that the URL will
          not change. Rerunning the setup script does not update the URL.
          Even upgrading the installer packages does not update the
          repository URL in properties.json. To pass a new repository
          value into properties.json, you have two options:

          Option 1

          You can remove the installer files and rerun the setup script:

mapr-setup.sh remove

          Using the remove command removes properties.json, the installer
          database, and the installer packages, but not the setup script.
          After the files are removed, you can rerun the setup script to
          specify the new repository URL. For more information about
          options you can use with mapr-setup.sh, see [16]Using
          mapr-setup.sh.

          Option 2

          If you need to retain the installer database and the cluster
          state information (for example, because you need to do an
          upgrade), you can:

         1. Edit the properties.json file manually to change the
            repo_core_url and the repo_eco_url entries to the correct
            values.
         2. Restart the MapR Installer:
systemctl restart mapr-installer

   What can I do if dropdown menus aren't working?
          Try any or all of the following to correct the problem:

          + Refresh the browser page.
          + Clear the browser cache.
          + Close and restart the browser or browser tab.

   Why does the MapR Installer URL not work?
          Check that the URL you are trying to access is external. For
          example, if you install on a cluster that is in the cloud, the
          URL that the MapR Installer lists may not work if it is an
          internal URL. Try accessing the external URL that is associated
          with the internal URL.

   Why doesn't the MapR Installer list the ecosystem component that I want
          to install?
          The MapR Installer Definitions package contains the MapR
          versions and services that you can install. Once you update the
          MapR Installer Definitions, you can install ecosystem components
          that were made available after you first configured the MapR
          Installer. See [17]Update the MapR Installer.

   On the Verify Nodes page, how can I get more information about a
          warning or error?
          Hold your cursor over the warning or error in the right pane to
          see more information about the specific warning or error
          condition.

   Why are the nodes listed on the Verify Nodes page different from those
          that I chose to install on?
          If you abort an installation and then install on a different set
          of nodes, you must use the Verify Nodes page to manually remove
          nodes that were part of the aborted installation but are no
          longer part of the current installation.

   I can't log in to Hue. What credentials should I be using to log into
          Hue for the first time?
          Log in with cluster administrator username that you configured
          while running mapr-setup.sh and the password mapr.

   What should I do if rerunning mapr-setup.sh generates errors because
          the properties.json file has incorrect information?
          The properties.json file stores information such as the user ID
          of the cluster administrator, the user ID of the MapR Installer,
          the OS type, Internet access information, and the repository
          URL. Once the repository URL has been stored in properties.json,
          the MapR Installer assumes that the URL will not change.
          Rerunning mapr-setup.sh does not update the URL. Even upgrading
          the installer packages does not update the repository URL in
          properties.json. To pass a new repository value into
          properties.json, you must first remove the installer files:

mapr-setup.sh -remove

          Using the -remove command removes properties.json, the installer
          database, and the installer packages, but not the setup script.
          After the files are removed, you can rerun mapr-setup.sh to
          specify the new repository URL. See [18]MapR Installer. For more
          information about options you can use with mapr-setup.sh, see
          [19]Using mapr-setup.sh.
