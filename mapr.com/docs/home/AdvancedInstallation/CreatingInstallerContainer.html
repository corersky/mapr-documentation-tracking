Creating a MapR Installer Container Using mapr-setup.sh

   This section describes how to create a MapR Installer Container image
   by using the mapr-setup.sh script.

Creating the Image

   To create a MapR Installer image using mapr-setup.sh:
    1. Download the mapr-setup.sh script to a Linux or Mac OS X platform
       where Docker 1.12.5 or later is installed and the Docker daemon is
       up and running. Choose one of the following download options:
       Note: Running mapr-setup.sh on Windows is not supported.
          + Download the setup script directly from [1]package.mapr.com to
            the node that will run the MapR Installer:
$ wget https://package.mapr.com/releases/installer/mapr-setup.sh -P /tmp
          + Download to your local workstation, and copy to the node that
            will run the MapR Installer:
              a. On the [2]MapR Download Page, click Download, and save
                 the setup script to a location on your workstation.
              b. Use a tool such as SCP to copy the file to the node that
                 will run the MapR Installer:
$ scp mapr-setup.sh user@server /tmp
    2. Run the mapr-setup.sh script with the docker installer command to
       create the Docker image:
./mapr-setup.sh docker installer
    3. Respond to the command-line prompts to provide the information to
       configure the image. The following table describes each prompt. If
       you press Enter without specifying a value, mapr-setup.sh uses the
       default value shown in the square brackets ([]):

   Prompt Notes
   Build MapR UI Installer image? (y/n) [y] Type y to continue or n to
   exit the script.
   Image OS class (centos7, ubuntu16) [<local OS>]: Specify the base
   operating system on which to build the image.

   Note: SUSE is not currently supported.
   Docker FROM base image name:tag [centos:centos7]: Specify the starting
   image used to create the new image. If necessary, you can enter your
   own tag and image name to choose a base image already created for your
   installation. If you do not enter a name, the script provides one for
   you.
   MapR installer image tag name [<name>] Accept the software-provided
   name for the container image, or provide your own name. This is the
   name you will use to run the image to create the MapR Installer
   container.
   Container memory: specify host XX[kmg] or 0 for no limit [0]: Specify
   the maximum amount of memory (in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes)
   that Docker allows the container to access. For example:
          + 2g
          + 4096m
          + 0

   Accepting the default (0), means there is no restriction on memory, and
   the container can use as much memory as the platform makes available.
    4. After the last prompt, press Enter. The script:
          + Prepares the installer
          + Installs or verifies installer package dependencies
          + Installs installer packages
          + Cleans up unneeded files
          + Creates the mapr-docker-installer.sh sample-run file and
            displays the location of the file:
Edit '/root/docker_images/installer/mapr-docker-installer.sh' to configure setti
ngs and then execute it to start the container
            mapr-docker-installer.sh contains environment variables for
            the image and makes it easy for you to start the container.
    5. (Optional) Edit the mapr-docker-installer.sh script file if you
       want to change any environmental variables. For more information
       about the environmental variables, see [3]Environmental Variables
       for the MapR Installer Container.
    6. Run the mapr-docker-installer.sh file to start mapr-installer
       services:
$ ./docker_images/installer/mapr-docker-installer.sh
       After the installer service is started, you can issue [4]Stanza
       commands or open the web-based MapR Installer in a browser:
installer (380) started with log /opt/mapr/installer/logs/installer.log
Started service mapr-installer

...Success

    To continue installing MapR software, open the following URL in a web browse
r

              If the address '172.17.0.2' is internal and not accessible
           from your browser, use the external address mapped to it instead

                              https://172.17.0.2:9443

   Note: The MapR Installer maintains the state of the cluster. When the
   installer is run from a container, the installer database is only as
   persistent as the container itself. If you need the installer data to
   be persistent, here are some options:
     * If you shut down a MapR Installer container, use the docker start
       command (not the docker run command) to restart the same instance
       of the container. If you create a new instance of the container,
       the database will have no information.
     * Mount the /opt/mapr/ data directory outside the container to
       persistent storage to maintain the cluster state.
     * Use the Stanza export command to export the state of the cluster
       before you shut down the container. See [5]Exporting a Cluster
       Configuration.

Running the MapR Installer Container Using Stanza Commands

   You can also use the sample-run file to execute a MapR Installer Stanza
   command. In this scenario, the command creates the installer container,
   runs a Stanza command, and then shuts down the container. For example,
   the following command runs the Stanza probe command on node
   10.10.88.53:
./docker_images/installer/mapr-docker-installer.sh probe -o config.ssh_id=root c
onfig.ssh_password=mapr config.hosts='["10.10.88.53"]' -nv

   For a list of the Stanza commands, see [6]MapR Installer Stanza
   commands.
