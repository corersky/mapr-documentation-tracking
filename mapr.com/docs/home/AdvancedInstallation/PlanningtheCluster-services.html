Select Services

   This section describes some of the services that can be run on a node.

   Every installation requires services to manage jobs and applications.
   ResourceManager and NodeManager manage MapReduce version 2 and other
   applications that can run on YARN. In addition, MapR requires the
   ZooKeeper service to coordinate the cluster, and at least one node must
   run the CLDB service. The WebServer service is required if the
   browser-based MapR Control System will be used.

   After you install MapR core, you can install ecosystem components that
   belong to a MapR Expansion Pack (MEP). A MEP provides a set of
   ecosystem components that work together. When a newer version or a
   revision to a component becomes available, the MEP version is updated
   to reflect the fact that an update was made. For details on the
   ecosystem components available in each MEP and the list of MEPs
   supported by your MapR cluster version, see [1]MapR Expansion Packs
   (MEPs).

   The following table shows some of the services that can be run on a
   node:
   Service Category Service

   Description
   Management Warden

   Warden runs on every node, coordinating the node's contribution to the
   cluster. Warden is also responsible for managing the service state and
   its resource allocations on that node.
   YARN NodeManager Hadoop YARN NodeManager service. The NodeManager
   manages node resources and monitors the health of the node. It works
   with the ResourceManager to manage YARN containers that run on the
   node.
   MapR Core FileServer

   FileServer is the MapR service that manages disk storage for MapR-FS
   and MapR-DB on each node.
   MapR Core CLDB

   Maintains the [2]container location database (CLDB) service. The CLDB
   service coordinates data storage services among MapR-FS file server
   nodes, and access across MapR NFS gateways, and MapR clients.
   MapR Core NFS

   Provides read-write MapR Direct Access NFSâ„¢ access to the cluster, with
   full support for concurrent read and write access.
   Storage MapR HBase Client

   Provides access to MapR-DB binary tables via HBase APIs. Required on
   all nodes that will access table data in MapR-FS, typically all edge
   nodes for accessing table data. HBase API can also be accessed through
   the HBase Thrift and Rest Gateways.
   YARN ResourceManager Hadoop YARN ResourceManager service. The
   ResourceManager manages cluster resources, and tracks resource usage
   and node health.
   Management ZooKeeper

   Internal service. Enables high availability (HA) and fault tolerance
   for MapR clusters by providing coordination.
   YARN HistoryServer Archives MapReduce application metrics and metadata.
   Management Web Server

   Contains static MapR Control System UI pages.
   Management Apiserver Allows you to perform cluster administration
   programmatically, and supports the MapR Control System (see [3]Setting
   Up the MapR Control System).
   OJAI Distributed Query Service Drill
   Provides the distributed query service powered by [4]Apache Drill for
   MapR-DB JSON. Supports the following functionality:
     * Advanced secondary index selection
     * Sorts on large data sets
     * Parallel query execution

   See [5]OJAI Distributed Query Service for more details about the
   service.
   Application Hue [6]Hue is the Hadoop User Interface that interacts with
   Apache Hadoop and its ecosystem components, such as Hive, Pig, and
   Oozie. It also provides interactive notebook access to Spark through
   Livy.
   Application Pig

   [7]Pig is a high-level data-flow language and execution framework.
   Application Hive

   [8]Hive is a data warehouse engine that supports SQL-like ad hoc
   querying and data summarization.
   Application Flume

   [9]Flume is a service for piping and aggregating large amounts of log
   data
   Application Oozie

   [10]Oozie is a workflow scheduler system for managing Hadoop jobs.
   Application HCatalog

   [11]HCatalog provides applications with a table view of the MapR-FS
   layer of the cluster, expanding your options from read/write data
   streams to add-[Hive]-table operations such as get row and store row.
   Application Cascading

   [12]Cascading is an application framework for analyzing and managing
   big data.
   Application Myriad [13]Myriad is an application framework that enables
   YARN applications and Mesos frameworks to run side-by-side while
   dynamically sharing cluster resources.

   When using Myriad, the ResourceManager is deployed using Marathon, and
   NodeManager is run as a Mesos task.
   Application Spark [14]Spark is a processing engine for large datasets.
   While it can be deployed locally or standalone, the recommended
   deployment is on YARN. The application timeline server component
   provides a historical view of query details.
   Application Sqoop

   [15]Sqoop is a library for transferring bulk data between Hadoop and
   relational databases.
