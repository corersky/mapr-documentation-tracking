Planning the Cluster

   Describes information and factors used in planning your cluster.

   A MapR installation is usually a large-scale set of individual servers,
   called nodes, collectively called a cluster. In a typical cluster, most
   nodes are dedicated to data processing and storage, and a smaller
   number of nodes run other services that provide cluster coordination
   and management.

   The first step in deploying MapR is planning which servers will form
   the cluster, and selecting the services that will run on each node. To
   determine whether a server is capable of contributing to the cluster,
   it may be necessary to check the requirements in [1]Preparing Each
   Node. Each node in the cluster must be carefully checked against these
   requirements; unsuitability of a node is one of the most common reasons
   for installation failure.

   The objective of a cluster plan is to detail each node's set of
   services.
