Installing HBase on a Client Node

   The following instructions use the package manager to download and
   install HBase from the MEP repository on to a client node. When you
   install HBase on a client node, you can use the HBase shell from a
   machine outside the cluster.
   Before you being, verify the following prerequisites:
     * The MEP repository is set up. For instructions on setting up the
       MEP repository, see [1]Step 10: Install Ecosystem Components
       Manually
     * The MapR client must be installed on the node where you install the
       HBase client.
       For MapR client setup instructions, see [2]Setting Up the Client.
     * You must know the IP addresses or hostnames of the ZooKeeper nodes
       on the cluster.

   Execute the following commands as root or using sudo.
    1. On the client computer, install mapr-hbase:

        CentOS or Red Hat

yum install mapr-hbase

        Ubuntu

apt-get install mapr-hbase

        SUSE

zypper install mapr-hbase

    2. On all HBase nodes, run [3]configure.sh with a list of the CLDB
       nodes and ZooKeeper nodes in the cluster.
