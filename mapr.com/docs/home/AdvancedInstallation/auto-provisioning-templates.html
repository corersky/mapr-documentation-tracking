Auto-Provisioning Templates

   Describes the MapR Installer auto-provisioning templates.

   Auto-provisioning templates let you select from different provisioning
   options to address a range of computing requirements. Each template
   provides a different mix of services and capabilities. You can select
   the template you need when installing using the MapR Installer
   web-based interface, MapR Installer Stanzas, or a cloud marketplace
   offering.

   MapR Installer 1.10 provides the following auto-provisioning templates:

MapR Installer 1.9 Updates to the Auto-Provisioning Templates

   For MapR Installer 1.9, the following changes to the auto-provisioning
   templates were implemented:
     * A new auto-provisioning template was added. The Operational
       Applications with MapR Database and Distributed Query Service
       template includes the MapR DataBase and the OJAI Distributed Query
       services.
     * Other templates were changed to enable the use of Drill as an
       optional selection with the OJAI Distributed Query Service. The
       following table compares the contents of the various MapR Database
       templates:

   Template MapR-DataBase OJAI Distributed Query Service* Drill
   MapR Converged Cluster: Batch, interactive and real-time analytics Y Y
   Y
   Analytics with MapR Database Y Y Y
   Operational Applications with MapR Database Y N N
   Operational Applications with MapR Database and Distributed Query
   Service Y Y N
       *Prior to MapR Installer 1.9, this service was called the OJAI
       Query Service.
