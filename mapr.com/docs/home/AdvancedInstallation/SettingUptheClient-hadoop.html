Running Hadoop Commands on a Mac and Windows Client

   The location from which you run Hadoop commands depends on your
   machine.

   When you run hadoop commands on the Mac and Windows client, use the
   Hadoop 2 version to run MapReduce version 2 applications.
            To run the..           Run the command from this location:
   Hadoop 2 version of the command

   On Windows: %MAPR_HOME%\hadoop\hadoop-2.x.x\bin

   On Mac: /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/bin

   On Linux installations, the installer creates symlinks to the hadoop
   directories by default. On Mac, you can [1]create the symlinks. Once
   the symlinks are created, you can specify the version of the hadoop
   command as mentioned in the [2]Hadoop command documentation.
   Important: Notes Specific to Windows
     * The user that runs hadoop commands from the hadoop 2 directory
       cannot have a space or a hyphen (-) in the username.
     * The native Hadoop library is not present on Windows. Therefore, the
       hadoop fs -getmerge command is not available.
