Using the Pre-Built MapR Installer Container Images

   This section describes how to obtain and run the pre-built MapR
   Installer container images.
   Pre-built MapR Installer 1.6 container images are available on Docker
   hub. Images are available for:
     * Ubuntu 16.04
     * Ubuntu 14.04
     * CentOS 7
     * CentOS 6

   The pre-built images are about 200 MB. A sample-run script that you can
   use to start the container is available on GitHub.
   To use a pre-built image:
    1. Download the pre-built MapR Installer container image and the
       sample-run script to a Linux or Mac OS X platform where Docker
       1.12.5 or later is installed and the Docker daemon is up and
       running.
          + You can download the pre-built image from the [1]MapR public
            repository.
          + You can download the sample-run script
            (mapr-docker-installer.sh) from this [2]GitHub location.
    2. (Optional) Edit the mapr-docker-installer.sh script file if you
       want to change any environmental variables. For more information
       about the environmental variables, see [3]Environmental Variables
       for the MapR Installer Container.
    3. Run the mapr-docker-installer.sh file to start mapr-installer
       services:
$ ./docker_images/installer/mapr-docker-installer.sh
       After the installer service is started, you can issue [4]Stanza
       commands or open the web-based MapR Installer in a browser:
installer (380) started with log /opt/mapr/installer/logs/installer.log
Started service mapr-installer

...Success

    To continue installing MapR software, open the following URL in a web browse
r

              If the address '172.17.0.2' is internal and not accessible
           from your browser, use the external address mapped to it instead

                              https://172.17.0.2:9443

       The MapR Installer maintains the state of the cluster. When the
       installer is run from a container, the installer database is only
       as persistent as the container itself. If you need the installer
       data to be persistent, here are some options:
          + If you shut down a MapR Installer container, use the docker
            start command (not the docker run command) to restart the same
            instance of the container. If you create a new instance of the
            container, the database will have no information.
          + Mount the /opt/mapr/ data directory outside the container to
            persistent storage to maintain the cluster state.
          + Use the Stanza export command to export the state of the
            cluster before you shut down the container. See [5]Exporting a
            Cluster Configuration.
