Preparing each Node

   Identifies major factors in preparing each node in your cluster.

   Each node contributes to the cluster, so each must be able to run MapR
   and Hadoop software. Nodes must meet minimum requirements for operating
   system, memory and disk resources and installed software, such as Java.
   Including unsuitable nodes in a cluster is a major source of
   installation difficulty.

   CAPTION: Table 1. Node Requirements

   Component                        Requirements
   CPU       64-bit x86
   OS        RedHat, Oracle Linux, CentOS, SUSE, or Ubuntu
   Memory    16 GB minimum, more in production
   Disk      Raw, unformatted drives and no partitions
   DNS       Hostname, reaches all other nodes
   Users     Common users across all nodes; passwordless ssh (optional)
   Java      Must run Java 1.8
   Other     NTP, Syslog, PAM

   Use the subsequent sections as a checklist to make each candidate node
   suitable for its assigned roles. Once each node has been prepared or
   disqualified, install MapR software.
