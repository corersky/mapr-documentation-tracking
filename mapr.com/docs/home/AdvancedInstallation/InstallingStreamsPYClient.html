Installing MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client

   The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client is a binding for
   librdkafka that is dependent on the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C
   client (MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client is a distribution of
   librdkafka that works with MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka).

Prerequisites

   Note: As of MapR 5.2.1, you can create Python client applications for
   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka.
   Verify that the following components are installed on the node:
     * MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client (mapr-librdkafka)
     * GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is installed on the node.
     * Python 2.7.1 and above or Python 3.x
     * Python pip
     * python-devel (This is required for nodes with the Linux operating
       system.)

   Note: For instructions on setting up the MEP repository, see [1]Step
   10: Install Ecosystem Components Manually.
   Important: Because the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client
   is dependent on the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client, you
   must configure the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client before
   using the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client. See
   [2]Configuring the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client.

   Note: The Python client is available for Linux or Mac operating
   systems.
   To install the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client using
   the [3]Python Software Foundation, run the following command as root or

lib" --global-option="--include-dirs=/opt/mapr/include/" mapr-streams-python
     * On Mac:
pip install â€“-user --global-option=build_ext --global-option="--library-dirs=/op
t/mapr/lib" --global-option="--include-dirs=/opt/mapr/include/" mapr-streams-pyt

Troubleshooting Mac OS Installation

   If you install the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka Python Client on a
   Mac without the --user flag, you may encounter a "Not Permitted" error,
   signifying that you don't have permission to create a LICENSE file. The
   error will look similar to the following:
Copying LICENSE -> /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/
                error: [Error 1] Operation not permitted:
                '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/LICENS
E'

   To fix this issue, execute the following steps. These steps apply to
   users with a new Mac OS Sierra version 10.12.5.
    1. Reboot your Mac while simultaneously holding the Command and R keys
       to go into Mac OS X Recovery mode.
    2. Select Utilities, and then Terminal.
    3. Type csrutil disable. A message will pop up, informing you that
       your System Integrity Protection (SIP) has been sucessfully
       disabled.
    4. Reboot your Mac again.
    5. Go into the Terminal and execute the following command as the root
       user:
pip install --global-option=build_ext  --global-option="--library-dirs=/opt/mapr
/lib" --global-option="--include-dirs=/opt/mapr/include/" mapr-streams-python
    6. Once the script runs successfully, reboot your Mac while holding
       the Command and R keys. You will go into Mac OS X Recovery mode.
    7. Select Utilities, and then Terminal.
    8. Type csruntil enable to enable your SIP.

   Note: To avoid this error, consider using a virtual Python environment
   or the --user flag.
