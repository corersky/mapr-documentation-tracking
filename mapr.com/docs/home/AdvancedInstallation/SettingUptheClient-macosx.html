Installing the MapR Client on Mac OS X

   This section describes how to install the MapR Client on Mac OS X.
   Limitation: Under OS X, the getgroups command returns a maximum of 16
   groups for a user. If the Mac OS user for which you are installing the
   MapR Client attempts to read or write to a MapR file system resource as
   a member of a group that was not included in the list of 16 groups
   returned by getgroups, file permission errors may result.
    1. Create the directory /opt: sudo mkdir -p /opt
    2. Download the file for the version that you want to install:
https://package.mapr.com/releases/<version>/mac/<mapr-client package name>
    3. Open the Terminal application.
    4. Extract mapr-client-<version>.tar.gz into the /opt directory:
sudo tar -C /opt -zxf mapr-client-<version>.tar.gz*
    5. Before running configure.sh, make sure that JAVA_HOME is set
       correctly for the client in the following script:
       /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh
       For example:
$ export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
    6. Run [1]configure.sh to configure the client.

        Non-secure cluster example
                In the following examples, the -N parameter specifies the
                cluster name, the -c (lowercase) option specifies a client
                configuration, the -C (uppercase) parameter specifies the
                CLDB nodes, and -HS specifies the HistoryServer node:

sudo /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N my.cluster.com -c -C mynode01:7222 -HS nod
eA

        Secure cluster example
                In the following example, the -N parameter specifies the
                cluster name, the -C (uppercase) parameter specifies the
                CLDB nodes, the -c (lowercase) option specifies a client
                configuration, and -secure indicates that the cluster is
                secure:

sudo /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N my.cluster.com -c -secure -C mynode01:7222

    7. To use this client with a secure cluster or clusters, copy the
       ssl_truststore file from the /opt/mapr/conf directory on the
       cluster to the /opt/mapr/conf directory on the client.
       If this client will connect to multiple clusters, merge the
       ssl_truststore files with the /opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh
       tool. See [2]Managing Secure Clusters for details on how to connect
       to a secure cluster.
