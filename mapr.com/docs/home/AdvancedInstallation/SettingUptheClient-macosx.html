Installing the MapR Client on Mac OS X

   This section describes how to install the MapR Client on Mac OS X.
   Limitation: Under OS X, the getgroups command returns a maximum of 16
   groups for a user. If the Mac OS user for which you are installing the
   MapR Client attempts to read or write to a MapR file system resource as
   a member of a group that was not included in the list of 16 groups
   returned by getgroups, file permission errors may result.
    1. Create the directory /opt: sudo mkdir -p /opt
    2. Download the file for the version that you want to install:
https://package.mapr.com/releases/<version>/mac/<mapr-client package name>
    3. Open the Terminal application.
    4. Extract mapr-client-<version>.tar.gz into the /opt directory:
sudo tar -C /opt -zxf mapr-client-<version>.tar.gz*
    5. Before running configure.sh, make sure that JAVA_HOME is set
       correctly for the client in the following script:
       /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh
       For example:
$ export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
    6. To use this client with a secure cluster or clusters, copy the
       ssl_truststore file from the /opt/mapr/conf directory on the
       cluster to the /opt/mapr/conf directory on the client.
       If this client will connect to multiple clusters, merge the
       ssl_truststore files with the /opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh
       tool.
    7. Run [1]configure.sh to configure the client. In the following
       examples, the -N parameter specifies the cluster name, the -c
       (lowercase) parameter specifies a client configuration, the -secure
       parameter is added if the cluster is secure, the -C (uppercase)
       parameter specifies the CLDB nodes, and the -HS parameter specifies
       the HistoryServer node. To ensure that the client can connect in
       the event of a CLDB node failure, all CLDB nodes are specified. For
       more information about the syntax, parameters, and behavior of
       configure.sh, see [2]configure.sh.

        Non-secure cluster example

sudo /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N my.cluster.com -c -C mynode01:7222,mynode0
2:7222,mynode03:7222 -HS nodeA

        Secure cluster example

sudo /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N my.cluster.com -c -secure -C mynode01:7222
,mynode02:7222,mynode03:7222

       Note:
       If the cluster was configured with a cluster-admin user:group that
       is different from the default mapr:mapr value, you must include
       options to specify the cluster-admin user and group information
       when you run configure.sh to configure the client.
       If the cluster-admin user ID is present on the client node, include
       these options:
          + -u
          + -g
       If the cluster-admin user ID is not present on the client node,
       include these options:
          + -u
          + -g
          + --create-user | -a
          + -U
          + -G
