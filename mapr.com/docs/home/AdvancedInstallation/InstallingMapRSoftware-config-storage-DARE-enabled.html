Configuring Storage with DARE Enabled

   This section describes how to format disks for cluster storage manually
   using disksetup with data-at-rest encryption (DARE) enabled.

Manually Running disksetup

   You can create a text file that lists the disks and partitions for use
   by MapR on a node. Each line should list either a single disk or all
   applicable partitions on a single disk. When listing multiple
   partitions on a line, separate each partition with a space. For
   example:
/dev/sdb
/dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdc4
/dev/sdd

   In the following example, /tmp/disklist is a text file that lists the
   disks and partitions:
   Example
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup /tmp/disklist

Using disksetup with DARE-Enabled Nodes

   In a DARE-enabled cluster, you must use a different set of steps to run
   disksetup. disksetup will fail on some nodes if the DARE master key is
   not available. CLDB nodes have a local copy of the DARE master key, so
   disksetup works on CLDB nodes. Other nodes require a connection with a
   running CLDB node in order to run disksetup.
   Use these steps to run disksetup on the CLDB nodes and then start the
   CLDB nodes so that you can then run disksetup on the remaining nodes
   and start those nodes:
    1. Format the disks on the CLDB nodes (the nodes that contain the
       dare.master.key):
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup /tmp/disklist
    2. Start ZooKeeper and Warden so that other nodes can access the DARE
       master key on the CLDB nodes:
         a. Start ZooKeeper on all the ZooKeeper nodes:
service mapr-zookeeper start
         b. Start Warden on the CLDB nodes:
service mapr-warden start
    3. Format the remaining node disks:
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup /tmp/disklist
    4. Start Warden on the remaining nodes:
service mapr-warden start
