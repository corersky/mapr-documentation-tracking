MapR PACC Known Issues

   This topic describes some known issues that you should be aware of
   while troubleshooting.
   Issue Description
   DOCâ€‘148 On Mac OS X, using mapr-setup.sh to create a Docker image can
   generate the following error when the ping to a hostname fails:
ERROR: Hostname <hostname> cannot be resolved. Correct the problem and retry map
r-setup.sh

   Workaround:
   To enable remote login on the Mac, select the Remote Login option in
   System Preferences > Sharing. Then retry the mapr-setup.sh command.
   INFO-47 When running PACC or Zeppelin Docker images, starting or
   restarting the FUSE client incorrectly reports FAILED. Docker generates
   an error like the following:
mapr-posix-client-container                [FAILED]

   If you can access the MapR file system from your client, then ignore
   the error. You can also confirm a successful FUSE client start by
   checking /opt/mapr/logs/posix-client-container.log. The following shows
   a successful start:

Mon Oct 16 10:50:06 PDT 2017: posix-client-container is mounted at /mapr.

   The error is due to incorrect handling of a MapR script's return exit
   code.
