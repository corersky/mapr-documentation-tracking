Using the MapR Subnet and MapR External Advanced Options

   In the advanced options available under Node Configuration, the MapR
   Installer allows you to restrict MapR to a subset of network interface
   cards (NICs) or to specify public IP addresses that can be used with
   the cluster nodes.

   Using these options has the same effect as manually inserting the
   MAPR_SUBNETS and MAPR_EXTERNAL environment variables into the
   [1]env_override.sh file on all nodes.
   Attention: The MapR Installer does not validate the functionality of
   the subnets or IP addresses that you provide. If you provide incorrect
   values, it is possible for the installation to succeed initially and
   later develop connectivity issues. For this reason, it is critical that
   you supply accurate values for the MapR Subnet and MapR External
   advanced options.

   MapR Subnet
          Allows you to set a subnet mask to restrict MapR services to
          certain interfaces. The values specified in this field are used
          to populate the MAPR_SUBNETS environment variable.

          Specify one or more comma-separated subnet masks. For example:

10.10.15.0/24,10.10.16.0/24

          For more information about how to use the MAPR_SUBNETS
          environment variable, see [2]Designating NICs for MapR.

   MapR External
          Allows you to specify external IP addresses for the CLDB, MapR
          Filesystem, and MAST Gateway nodes.

          Do NOT use DNS names. Specify a comma-separated list of tuples
          of host names and external IP addresses. For example:

node1:1.1.1.1,node2:1.1.1.2,node3:1.1.1.3

          The specified node names need to match the host name you
          specified for the host earlier in Node Configuration. For more
          information about how to use the MAPR_SUBNETS environment
          variable, see [3]Designating NICs for MapR.
