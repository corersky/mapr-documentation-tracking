Step 11: Run configure.sh

   Run configure.sh with the -R option to complete the configuration of
   ecosystem components that were added manually.
   After installing ecosystem components manually, you must run the
   configure.sh script with the -R option on each node in the cluster:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
