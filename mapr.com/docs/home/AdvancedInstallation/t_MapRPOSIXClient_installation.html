Installing mapr-loopbacknfs Packages

   MapR POSIX clients enable app servers, web servers, and other client
   nodes and apps to read and write directly and securely to a MapR
   cluster
   The MapR POSIX client can be installed on any client node, even your
   laptop, if you have Linux installed. The feature requires a loopbacknfs
   license, which is limited to a single user.
   Note: A client node must have a supported Linux OS distribution and
   must be outside the MapR cluster, not running mapr-fileserver or other
   Hadoop services. You cannot install the MapR POSIX client on a Windows
   or Mac OS X machine.
