Installing the mapr-loopbacknfs Package

   MapR POSIX clients enable application servers, web servers, and other
   client nodes and applications to read and write directly and securely
   to a MapR cluster.
   You can install the mapr-loopbacknfs client on any client node, even
   your laptop, if you have Linux installed. This feature requires a
   loopbacknfs license, which is limited to a single user.

   A client node must have a supported Linux OS distribution and must be
   outside the MapR cluster, not running mapr-fileserver or other Hadoop
   services. You cannot install the MapR POSIX client on a Windows or Mac
   OS X machine.
   Attention: MapR does not recommend installing the mapr-loopbacknfs
   client on a cluster node.

   To install mapr-loopbacknfs on your machine, perform the following
   steps for your version of Linux, as the root user or using sudo. The
   package is installed to the /usr/local/mapr-loopbacknfs directory.
     * For CentOS, RedHat, or Oracle Linux
[root@ip-<ip_address> ~] # yum install mapr-loopbacknfs
     * For Suse
# zypper install mapr-compat-suse
# zypper install mapr-loopbacknfs
     * For Ubuntu
