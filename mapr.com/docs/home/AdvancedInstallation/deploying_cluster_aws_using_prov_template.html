Deploying a Cluster in AWS Using a Marketplace Offering

Prerequisites for Using a Marketplace Offering

   MapR marketplace offerings leverage predefined provisioning templates
   that simplify the process of provisioning the instance and installing
   the cluster. To run the predefined provisioning templates, you need to
   have the following permissions to create roles and policies in AWS:
     * iam:GetRole
     * iam:PassRole
     * iam:PutRolePolicy
     * iam:CreateRole
     * iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile
     * iam:CreateInstanceProfile

   If you do not have these permissions, consider using the MapR reference
   templates to deploy your cluster. See [1]About the MapR Reference
   Templates for AWS.

Steps for Deploying Using a Marketplace Offering

   Use these steps to deploy a cluster using one of the MapR Marketplace
   offerings for AWS:
    1. Navigate to the MapR page in the AWS Marketplace. For more
       information, see [2]MapR Offerings in the AWS Marketplace.
    2. Click the title of the MapR offering that you want to use. AWS
       displays product overview and pricing information for you to
       review.
    3. Set the region and EC2 instance type.
    4. Click Continue to Subscribe. The Subscribe to this software page
       appears.
    5. Click Continue to Configuration. The Configure this software page
       appears.
    6. In the Fulfillment Option field, select Select a CloudFormation
       template.
    7. Click Continue to launch. The Launch this software page appears.
    8. Under Choose Action, select Launch CloudFormation.
    9. Click Launch. The Create Stack page is displayed. Note that the
       Specify an Amazon S3 Template URL option is selected, and the URL
       for the MapR template is prefilled in the URL field.
   10. Click Next. The MapR CloudFormation template is displayed.
   11. Fill in the template as follows.

Filling in the Template Values

   Note: The Community Edition and bring-your-own-license (BYOL) offerings
   contain some template parameters that are not present in the Converged
   and Analytics offerings. These parameters are marked accordingly in the
   following steps.
    1. In the Specify Details section, enter a stack name in the stack
       name field. The stack name cannot contain spaces.
    2. In the Parameters section, enter a cluster name for the clusterName
       field.
    3. Enter a password for the clusterAdminPassword field. This is the
       password you will use to log into MCS or the MapR Installer.
       Note: For cloud deployments, the installer uses the Cluster Admin
       Password as the MySQL root password when it creates a MySQL
       database for services that require a database.
    4. Enter the MapR Expansion Pack version for the MEP field.
    5. In the provisioningTemplate list, select from the list of
       auto-provisioning templates. For more information about the
       templates, see [3]Auto-Provisioning Templates. This parameter is
       provided only for the BYOL / Community and Converged offerings.
    6. In the nodeCount field, specify the number of nodes in the cluster.
    7. In the installerOnitsOwn field, select true to configure the MapR
       Installer on a node that is not part of the cluster. If true is
       selected, the installer is started on a t2.small instance. Select
       false to configure the installer on a node in the cluster. If you
       select true, the cluster will consist of the nodeCount plus another
       node for the installer. This parameter is provided only for the
       BYOL / Community offerings.
    8. In the Node Configuration section, select an instance type from the
       InstanceType list. The MapR-supported instance types in AWS are:
          + m4.xlarge, m4.2xlarge, m4.4xlarge, m4.10xlarge, m4.16xlarge
          + m3.xlarge, m3.2xlarge
          + c4.2xlarge, c4.4xlarge, c4.8xlarge
          + c3.2xlarge, c3.4xlarge, c3.8xlarge
          + r4.large, r4.xlarge, r4.2xlarge, r4.4xlarge, r4.8xlarge
          + r3.large, r3.xlarge, r3.2xlarge, r3.4xlarge, r3.8xlarge
          + p2.xlarge
          + g2.8xlarge
          + Local Storage Instances (Use only local disks, not EBS)
          + i3.large, i3.xlarge, i3.2xlarge, i3.4xlarge, i3.8xlarge
          + d2.xlarge, d2.2xlarge, d2.4xlarge, d2.8xlarge
       For more information about instance types, see [4]Amazon EC2
       Instance Types.
    9. In the useinstanceStore field, set the value to true if the machine
       type supports instance stores (ephemeral disks) and you want to use
       only those disks. No EBS volumes will be attached. This parameter
       is provided only for the BYOL / Community offerings.
       Note: This field is enabled for d2.* and i3.* instance types. i3.*
       uses NVMe disks, which are added by default in AWS. If you use i3.*
       images, the option is implicitly true.
   10. In the diskCount field, specify the number of disks per node.
   11. In the diskType field, specify the disk type. For more information,
       see [5]Amazon EBS Volume Types.
   12. In the diskSize field, specify the disk size.
   13. In the AWS Infrastructure Configuration section, enter a key pair
       in the keyName field. Use the keypair that you configured in
       "Creating a Key Pair."
   14. In the useExistingSubnet field, leave this field empty if you would
       like a new VPC and subnets created. Specify a subnet ID if you want
       to use existing subnets.
       If you choose to use your own subnet:
          + The subnet must have access to the Internet.
          + The subnet must be able to communicate to all hosts within the
            subnet on all ports.
          + You must have a mechanism to connect with the hosts on the
            subnet.
   15. In the securityGroups field, specify the security group IDs for an
       existing subnet if you specified a subnet ID for useSubnet. Leave
       this field empty to create a new VPC and subnets.
   16. In the assignPublicIP field, set the value to true if you want to
       assign a public IP address to each node. Otherwise, set the value
       to false.
       Note: It is recommended that you enable assignPublicIP if you are
       not using your own subnet, and you are letting the template create
       the VPC and subnet.
   17. In the publicAccessCIDR field, specify an IP address range if you
       want to restrict the IP address from which the stack can be
       accessed. This field applies only when the template creates the VPC
       and subnets.
   18. Click Next. The Options section is displayed. MapR templates don't
       require any specific values in this section. However, in the
       Advanced subsection, for debugging purposes it can be useful to set
       Rollback on failure to No so that resources are not deleted in the
       event of failure.
   19. Click Next. The Review page allows you to review your selections.
       Click Previous if you need to change a selection.
   20. Otherwise, select I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might
       create IAM resources with custom names.
   21. Click Create to start the process of stack creation. The new stack
       is listed at the top of the CloudFormation console with a status of
       CREATE_IN_PROGRESS. To view the status of stack creation, select
       the stack, and click the Events tab.
       Note: Stack creation for a three-node cluster can take 15-20
       minutes. Depending on the size of the cluster, stack creation can
       take longer in some cases.
   22. When the stack creation status shows CREATE_COMPLETE, the stack is
       created, and the cluster is installed. Click the Outputs tab to
       view the outputs. For example:
       [outputs_tab_aws_offering.png]
   23. If stack creation generates an error, click the Events tab to get
       more information. You can expand the event message to see more
       information about the event.
   24. If you are using an existing subnet, set up a secure connection to
       the subnet by using VPN or other means.
   25. Once you are connected, you can click the MaprInstallerUrl link on
       the Outputs tab to start the web-based installer. The installer
       status page shows links to resources you can use to get more
       information about the cluster. To log on to the MapR Control System
       (MCS), click the Administration Server Link.
