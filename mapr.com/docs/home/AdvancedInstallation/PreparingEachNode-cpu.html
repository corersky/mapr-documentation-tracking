CPU and Operating System

   This section describes how to check that your processor and operating
   system are supported by MapR software.

Processor is 64-bit

   To determine the processor type, run
$ uname -m
x86_64

   If the output includes "x86_64," the processor is 64-bit. If it
   includes "i386," "i486," "i586," or "i686," it is a 32-bit processor,
   which is not supported by MapR software.

   If the results are "unknown," or none of the above, try one of these
   alternative commands.
$ uname -a
Linux mach-name 2.6.35-22-server #33-Ubuntu SMP Sun Sep 19 20:48:58 UTC 2012 x86
_64 GNU/Linux

   In the cpuinfo file, the flag 'lm' (for "long-mode") indicates a 64-bit
   processor.
$ grep flags /proc/cpuinfo
flags               : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca c
mov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss syscall nx rdtscp lm constan
t_tsc up arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good xtopology tsc_reliable nonstop_tsc aperf
mperf pni pclmulqdq ssse3 cx16 sse4_1 sse4_2 popcnt aes hypervisor lahf_lm ida a
rat

Operating System is supported

   For information on supported operating systems, see [1]Operating System
   Support Matrix.

   To determine the name and version of the installed operating system,
   run the lsb_release -a command.
   Note: If the lsb_release command reports "No LSB modules are
   available", this is not a problem.
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 10.10
Release:        10.10
Codename:       maverick

   If the lsb_release command is not found, try one of the following
   alternatives.
$ cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.6.35-22-server (build@allspice) (gcc version 4.4.5 (Ubuntu/Linar
o 4.4.4-14ubuntu4) ) #33-Ubuntu SMP Sun Sep 19 20:48:58 UTC 2012
$ cat /etc/*-release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=10.10
DISTRIB_CODENAME=maverick
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 10.10"

   If you determine that the node is running an older version of a
   supported OS, upgrade to at least a supported version and test the
   upgrade before proceeding. If you find a different Linux distribution,
   such as Fedora or Gentoo, the node must be reformatted and a supported
   distro installed.
