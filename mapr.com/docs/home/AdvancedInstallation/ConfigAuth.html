Configuring Authentication

   Both the MCS UI and apiserver (that processes REST API calls) require
   one of the following method of authentication:
     * Basic authentication (with a username and password) on secure and
       non-secure clusters. Refer to [1]documentation for information on
       setting up username, password, and permissions for accessing MCS
       and REST API calls.
     * Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) on
       secure clusters to authenticate REST calls to the MapR Control
       System (MCS) and access the resources directly. Refer to
       [2]documentation for information on configuring SPNEGO for MCS and
       REST API calls.
     * Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for password verification.
       Refer to [3]documentation for information on configuring PAM for
       MCS and REST API calls.

   For information on using the MCS UI, maprcli commands, and the REST
   APIs, refer to topics under [4]6.0 Administration.
