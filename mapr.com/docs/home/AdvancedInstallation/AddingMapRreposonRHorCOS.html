Adding the MapR repository on RedHat, CentOS, or Oracle Linux

   This section describes how to install the MapR internet repository.
    1. Change to the root user or use sudo.
    2. Create a text file called maprtech.repo in the /etc/yum.repos.d/
       directory with the following content, replacing <version> with the
       version of MapR that you want to install: (See the [1]Version 6.0.1
       Release Notes for the correct paths for all past releases.)
[maprtech]
name=MapR Technologies
baseurl=https://package.mapr.com/releases/<version>/redhat/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
protect=1

[maprecosystem]
name=MapR Technologies
baseurl=https://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/redhat
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
protect=1
    3. If your connection to the Internet is through a proxy server, you
       must set the http_proxy environment variable before installation:
       You should also set the value for the http_proxy environment
       variable by adding the following section to the /etc/yum.conf file:
http_proxy=http://<host>:<port>
export http_proxy
proxy=http://<host>:<port>
proxy_username=<username>
proxy_password=<password>
