Step 3: Install MapR Service Packages

   The installation process will vary based on the location of your
   packages and the configuration of your cluster.

   Install services based on your [1]cluster plan and service layout.
   Note: Before installing MapR software using the published packages,
   make sure that you have reviewed the list of known vulnerabilities in
   [2]Security Vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability applies to your
   release, contact your MapR support representative for a fix, and apply
   the fix immediately, if applicable.

List of Packages by Mode

   The following table lists the MapR core packages to install on cluster
   nodes:

   Installation

   YARN

   Packages to install on all [compute] cluster nodes

   mapr-fileserver

   Packages to install on designated cluster nodes

   mapr-cldb

   mapr-zookeeper

   mapr-mastgateway

   mapr-nfs^*

   mapr-webserver

   mapr-apiserver

   mapr-gateway

   mapr-resourcemanager

   mapr-nodemanager

   mapr-historyserver

   mapr-timelineserver

   Package to install on client machines that run hadoop commands that are
   not already part of the cluster
   mapr-client

   ^* When you install mapr-nfs, NFSv3 is installed. To install NFSv4, you
   must use the mapr-nfs4server package. If you wish to configure NFSv4
   server to work with Kerberos servers, you must first install Active
   Directory and Kerberos servers. For more information, see [3]Installing
   MapR NFS and [4]Configuring NFSv4 Server for Kerberos.
   Warning: This table is a rough guide and does not include the
   additional packages required for internal [5]Packages and Dependencies
   for MapR Software or Hadoop ecosystem components.

   Install the packages based on a thorough plan. For example cluster
   designs, see [6]Example Cluster Designs.

   To install MapR, select one of the installation methods in the
   subsequent topics, depending on your operating system.

Installing from a Repository

   Before installing from the repository, change to the root user or use
   sudo.
     * On RedHat, CentOS, or Oracle Linux, use the yum command to install
       the services that you want to run on the node.
       Syntax and Example
yum install <package_name> <package_name> <package_name>
yum install mapr-fileserver mapr-nodemanager
     * On SUSE, use the zypper command to install the services that you
       want to run on the node.
       Syntax and Example
zypper install <package_name> <package_name> <package_name>
zypper install mapr-fileserver mapr-nodemanager
     * On Ubuntu, use the apt-get commands to update the Ubuntu package
       cache and install the services that you want to run on the node.
         1. Update the Ubuntu package cache:
apt-get update
         2. Install the services:
            Syntax and Example
apt-get install <package_name> <package_name> <package_name>
apt-get install mapr-fileserver mapr-nodemanager

Installing from a Local Repository

   Before installing from the repository, change to the root user or use
   sudo.
     * On RedHat, CentOS, Oracle Linux, or SUSE, use rpm command to
       install the appropriate packages for the node:
         1. Change the working directory to the location where the rpm
            package files are located.
         2. Install the services:
            Syntax and Example
yum install <package_file> <package_file> <package_file>
yum install /path/to/mapr-core-<version>.x86_64.rpm mapr-cldb-<version>.x86_64.r
pm \
              mapr-resourcemanager-<version>.x86_64.rpm mapr-webserver-<version>
.x86_64.rpm \
            Note: Replace <version> with the exact version string found in
            the package filename.
     * On Ubuntu, use the dpkg command to install the appropriate packages
       for the node.
         1. Change the working directory to the location where the deb
            package files are located.
         2. Install the services:
            Syntax and Example
dpkg -i <package_file> <package_file> <package_file>
dpkg -i mapr-core-<version>.x86_64.rpm mapr-cldb-<version>.x86_64.rpm \
              mapr-resourcemanager-<version>.x86_64.rpm mapr-webserver-<version>
.x86_64.rpm \
            Note: Replace <version> with the exact version string found in
            the package filename.

Installing from Package Files

   When you install from package files, you must manually pre-install any
   dependency packages in order for the installation to succeed. Most MapR
   packages depend on the package mapr-core. Similarly, many Hadoop
   ecosystem components have internal dependencies. See [7]Packages and
   Dependencies for MapR Software for details.
