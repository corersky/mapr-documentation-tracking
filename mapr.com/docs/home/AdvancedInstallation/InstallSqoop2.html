Installing Sqoop2

   This topic includes instructions for using package managers to download
   and install Sqoop2 from the MEP repository.
   For instructions on setting up the MEP repository, see [1]Step 10:
   Install Ecosystem Components Manually.
   Sqoop2 includes two packages:
     * The client package, mapr-sqoop2-client (install on each node that
       will act as a client)
     * The server package, mapr-sqoop2-server (install on at least one
       node in the cluster)

   The Sqoop2 server also acts as a MapReduce client, so each node where
   you install the mapr-sqoop2-server package must also have Hadoop
   installed and configured. If you have a lot of client users, you can
   install multiple servers on multiple nodes, so as not to overload a
   single server.
   Warning: Sqoop2 packages cannot be installed on the same nodes as
   Sqoop1 packages. However, you can use both versions in the same Hadoop
   cluster by installing Sqoop1 and Sqoop2 on different nodes.
   Execute the following commands as root or using sudo:
    1. On each Sqoop2 server node, install mapr-sqoop2-server:

        On Ubuntu

apt-get install mapr-sqoop2-server

        On RedHat and CentOS

yum install mapr-sqoop2-server

        On SUSE

zypper install mapr-sqoop2-server

    2. On each Sqoop2 client node, install mapr-sqoop2-client:

        On Ubuntu

apt-get install mapr-sqoop2-client

        On RedHat and CentOS

yum install mapr-sqoop2-client

        On SUSE

zypper install mapr-sqoop2-client

    3. Run configure.sh -R:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
    4. Start each Sqoop server node.
maprcli node services -name sqoop2 -action start -nodes <space delimited list of
 nodes>
