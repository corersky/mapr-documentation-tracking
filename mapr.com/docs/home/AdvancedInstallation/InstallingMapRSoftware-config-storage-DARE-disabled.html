Configuring Storage with DARE Disabled

   This section describes how to format disks for cluster storage manually
   using disksetup with data-at-rest encryption (DARE) disabled.

Manually Running disksetup

   You can create a text file that lists the disks and partitions for use
   by MapR on a node. Each line should list either a single disk or all
   applicable partitions on a single disk. When listing multiple
   partitions on a line, separate each partition with a space. For
   example:
/dev/sdb
/dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdc4
/dev/sdd

   In the following example, /tmp/disklist is a text file that lists the
   disks and partitions:
   Example
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup /tmp/disklist
