Deploying a Cluster in Azure Using the MapR Marketplace Offering

   Use these steps to deploy a cluster using the MapR marketplace offering
   in Azure:

Select the Offering

    1. Navigate to the MapR page in the Azure Marketplace. For more
       information, see [1]MapR Offerings in the Azure Marketplace.
    2. Select the MapR Converged Data Platform v6 BYOL offering.
    3. Click Create.

Configure Basic Settings

    1. In the Admin username field, enter the user name for the cluster
       administrator (typically mapr). This is the operating system admin
       user name for all machines in the cluster.
    2. In the Authentication type field, select Password or SSH public
       key.
    3. In the Admin password field, enter the password for the Admin user.
       The password must be between 12 and 72 characters long and must
       have three of the following:
          + One lower case character
          + One upper case character
          + One number
          + One special character that is not "\" or "-".
       Note: For cloud deployments, the installer uses the Cluster Admin
       Password as the MySQL root password when it creates a MySQL
       database for certain services that require a database.
    4. Confirm (re-enter) the Admin password.
    5. In the Subscription field, enter the subscription option that is
       appropriate for your installation.
    6. In the Resource group field, select the option to create a new
       resource group, or select the option to use an existing group. If
       you want to create a new resource group, type the name of the
       resource group.
    7. In the Location field, select your region.
    8. Click OK.

Configure the MapR Cluster Configuration

    3. In the Public internet access CIDR field, enter the public Internet
       access CIDR. (Use * for all Internet traffic.) This field allows

       more information, see [4]Using OpenVPN.
    4. Once you are connected, you can click the MAPRINSTALLERURL to start
       the web-based installer. The installer status page shows links to
       resources you can use to get more information about the cluster. To
       log on to the MapR Control System (MCS), click the Administration
       Server link.
