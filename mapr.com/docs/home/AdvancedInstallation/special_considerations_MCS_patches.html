Special Considerations for MCS Patches

   Patches for the MapR Control System (MCS) are handled differently from
   patches for MapR data nodes and CLDB nodes.

   MCS software is updated as a package rather than a patch file. While
   MapR Core patches typically include a prefix such as mapr-patch or
   mapr-patch-client, or mapr-patch-posix-client-basic, MCS software is
   updated as a new package and does not use the MapR Core patch
   mechanism.

   To identify an MCS patch package, look for mapr-apiserver or
   mapr-webserver in the package name, and use these steps to update your
   currently installed packages:
    1. Stop the apiserver service on all MCS nodes:
$ maprcli node services -filter [csvc==apiserver] -name apiserver -action stop
    2. Upgrade the existing mapr-apiserver and mapr-webserver packages.
       For example:
          + On CentOS/Redhat or SUSE:
$ rpm -Uvh <path to new mapr-apiserver>
$ rpm -Uvh <path to new mapr-webserver>
          + On Ubuntu:
$ dpkg -i <path to new mapr-apiserver>
$ dpkg -i <path to new mapr-webserver>
    3. Run [1]configure.sh to update the configuration for the new
       packages:
$ /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R --noRecalcMem
    4. Start the apiserver service on all MCS nodes:
$ maprcli node services -filter [csvc==apiserver] -name apiserver -action start
