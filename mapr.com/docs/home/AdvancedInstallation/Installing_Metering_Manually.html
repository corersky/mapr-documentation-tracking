Installing Metering Using Manual Steps

   This section describes how to install Metering by using manual steps.
   For MapR 6.1 and later releases, no special steps are needed to install
   Metering. Following the manual installation steps in [1]Installing
   without the MapR Installer installs Metering. Note these
   considerations:
     * Metering is included in the mapr-apiserver package and is installed
       when you install or upgrade to MapR 6.1.
     * Metering requires a minimal level of metrics collection to be
       enabled. You must install collectd and OpenTSDB. See [2]Step 8:
       Install Metrics Monitoring. Grafana does not need to be installed
       for metering and is optional for metrics monitoring in general.
     * The [3]manual steps for configuring metrics collection configure
       collectd to monitor all available node metrics. You can configure
       collectd to collect only metering metrics (and omit MapR Database
       table metrics) by using the -EPcollectd -minimal option with
       configure.sh. For example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C nodeA -Z nodeB -EPcollectd -minimal
       To change from the minimal collection configuration back to the
       full collection configuration, use the â€‘EPcollectd -all option with
       configure.sh.

   To use Metering, see [4]Metering.
