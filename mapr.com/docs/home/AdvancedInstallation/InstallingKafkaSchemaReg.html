Installing Kafka Schema Registry (Developer Preview)

   This topic includes instructions for using package managers to download
   and install the Kafka Schema Registry from a MapR repository.
   The Kafka Schema Registry is a service that provides a RESTful
   interface for storing and retrieving Avro schemas.
   Note: This feature is presented as a developer preview. Developer
   previews are not tested for production environments, and should be used
   with caution.

   Because it is a developer preview feature, the Kafka Schema Registry is
   not provided in the MEP 6.1 repository. You must download the packages
   from [1]https://package.mapr.com/labs/mapr-schema-registry. Using the
   MapR Installer to install the Kafka Schema Registry is not currently
   supported.

   The Kafka Schema Registry can be installed on one or several nodes. To
   install the schema registry package on a node, use the following steps.
   Run the following commands as root or using sudo:
    1. Install the schema registry package:
       On Ubuntu:
apt-get install mapr-schema-registry
       On RedHat/ CentOS:
yum install mapr-schema-registry
       On SUSE:
zypper install mapr-schema-registry
    2. Run configure.sh -R:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       Note: Because the Kafka Schema Registry is managed by Warden, you
       don't have to restart Warden after installing the registry. Warden
       brings up the service after a few minutes.

   To manage and administer the Kafka Schema Registry, see [2]Kafka Schema
   Registry (Developer Preview).
