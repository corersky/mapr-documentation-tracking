Installing Hue

   This topic includes instructions for using package managers to download
   and install Hue from the MEP repository.
   For instructions on setting up the MEP repository, see [1]Step 10:
   Install Ecosystem Components Manually.
   Note: The Hue package, mapr-hue, can be installed on either a MapR
   cluster node (recommended) or a MapR client node. If you choose to
   install on a client node, keep in mind that Hue directories are owned
   by the user who installed Hue.
   Execute the following commands as root or using sudo.
    1. Install the Hue packages.
       On Ubuntu:
apt-get install mapr-hue
       On RedHat/ CentOS:
yum install mapr-hue
       On SUSE:
zypper install mapr-hue
    2. If the node is a MapR Client node, follow the additional
       instructions:
         a. To determine who the <INSTALL_USER> is, enter:
logname
         b. Set the following properties in hue.ini to that user.
server_user=<INSTALL_USER>
server_group=<INSTALL_USER>
default_user=<INSTALL_USER>
         c. Change the default_hdfs_superuser property to the owner of
            /var on the cluster.
            Warning: The <INSTALL_USER> must exist on the cluster on all
            nodes. It must also be set as the proxy user in all
            configuration files listed in [2]Configure Hue, depending on
            the Hue version you are installing.
    3. Run configure.sh -R:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R

   Installing Other Components

   Based on your requirements, you may also want to install the following
   components on at least one node in the cluster.
   Component Description
   MapR Database Required for access to MapR Database tables
   HttpFS Required for viewing files in MapR Filesystem through Hue file
   browser
   Sqoop2 Required to create and submit jobs to transfer bulk data between
   structured datastores and the MapR Filesystem.
   Spark Required to process data using the Notebook UI.
   Hive Required to run queries with HiveServer2.

   When you finish installing Hue, go to [3]Configure Hue to learn how to
   configure Hue.
