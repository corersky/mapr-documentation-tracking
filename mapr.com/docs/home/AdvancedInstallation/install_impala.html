Install Impala

   This topic provides instructions for using package managers to download
   and install Impala from the MEP repository.
   Install the Impala package on nodes in the cluster that you have
   designated to run Impala. Install the Impala server on every node
   designated to run impalad. Install the statestore and catalog packages
   on only one node in the cluster.
   Note: It is recommended that you install statestore and catalog
   together on a separate machine from the Impala server.

   Complete the following steps to install Impala, impala-server,
   statestore, and catalog:
    1. Install the mapr-impala package on all the nodes designated to run
       Impala. To install the package, issue the following command:
$ sudo yum install mapr-impala
    2. In /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh, complete the
       following steps:
         a. Verify that the statestore address is set to the address where
            you plan to run the statestore service.
IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST=<IP address hosting statestore>
         b. Change the catalog service address to the address where you
            plan to run the catalog service.
CATALOG_SERVICE_HOST=<IP address hosting catalog service>
         c. Add the mem_limit and num_threads_per_disk parameters to
            IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS to allocate a specific amount of memory to
            Impala, and limit the number of threads that each disk
            processes per impala server daemon. The default Impala memory
            setting is high, which can result in conflict between Impala
            and other frameworks running in the cluster. Adding these
            parameters can alleviate any potential resource conflicts.
export IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS=${IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS:- \
    -log_dir=${IMPALA_LOG_DIR} \
    -state_store_port=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_PORT} \
    -use_statestore -state_store_host=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST} \
    -catalog_service_host=${CATALOG_SERVICE_HOST} \
    -be_port=${IMPALA_BACKEND_PORT} \
    -mem_limit=<absolute notation or percentage of physical memory> \
    -num_threads_per_disk=<n>}
       See [1]Additional Impala Configuration Options for more information
       about these options and other options that you can modify in
       env.sh.
       Warning:
       The default maximum heap space allocated to the MapR-FS file server
       should provide enough memory for the MapR-FS file server to run
       concurrently with Impala, however you can modify it if needed. To
       modify the maximum heap space, navigate to
       /opt/mapr/conf/warden.conf, and change the
       service.command.mfs.heapsize.maxpercent parameter. Issue the
       following command to restart Warden after you modify the parameter:
service mapr-warden restart
       Refer to [2]warden.conf for more Warden configuration information.
    3. Verify that the following property is configured in hive-site.xml
       on all the nodes:
<property>
        <name>hive.metastore.uris</name>
        <value>thrift://<metastore_server_host>:9083</value>
</property>
    4. Install the Impala components.
         a. To install the statestore service, issue the following
            command:
$ sudo yum install mapr-impala-statestore
         b. To install the catalog service, issue the following command:
$ sudo yum install mapr-impala-catalog
         c. To install the Impala server, issue the following command:
$ sudo yum install mapr-impala-server
    5. Run configure.sh to refresh the node configuration.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
    6. If the Hive metastore has MapR-SASL enabled, copy
       $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml to $IMPALA_HOME/conf/. Repeat this
       step any time hive-site.xml is modified.

   At this point, the Impala servers, catalog, and statestore should be
   running. For instructions on how to run a simple Impala query and how
   to query MapR-DB tables, refer to [3]Example: Running an Impala SQL
   Query and [4]Query MapR-DB and HBase Tables with Impala.
