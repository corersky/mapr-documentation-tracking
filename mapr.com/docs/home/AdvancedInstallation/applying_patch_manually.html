Applying a Patch Manually

   MapR patches are version-specific and cumulative. Each patch contains
   the code fixes that were included in the previous patch for that MapR
   version.

   For patch-download information, see [1]Applying a Patch.
   Note: You can also apply a patch using the MapR Installer. See
   [2]Applying a Patch Using the MapR Installer.

   Applying a patch is a 3 step process:
   [3][USEMAP:patch_install_steps.png]

   When you apply a patch to the cluster, the patched files along with
   original files (non-patched) are copied to the /opt/mapr/.patch folder.
   In the /opt/mapr/.patch folder, the file ending with .O is the original
   file (non-patched) and the file ending with .<patch_number> is the
   patched version. Therefore, if there is a file under
   /opt/mapr/.patch/lib/, you can compare that with the corresponding file
   under /opt/mapr/lib/ by using the md5sum command to verify that the
   patch was successfully deployed.
   Note: A patch for a given software version can be removed, and an older
   patch for the same MapR software version can be installed. However,
   rolling back a cluster from a newer MapR version to an older version is
   not supported

   Contact support@mapr.com if you need more information or if you face
   any problems with patch installation.
