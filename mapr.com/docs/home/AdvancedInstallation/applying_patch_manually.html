Applying a Patch Manually

   MapR patches are version-specific and cumulative. Each patch contains
   the code fixes that were included in the previous patch for that MapR
   version.
   Before applying a patch, note these considerations:
     * For patch-download information, see [1]Applying a Patch.
     * The steps for patching the MapR Control System (MCS) are different
       from the steps for patching MapR Core. See [2]Special
       Considerations for MCS Patches.
     * You can also apply a patch using the MapR Installer. See
       [3]Applying a Patch Using the MapR Installer.
     * A patch for a given software version can be removed, and an older
       patch for the same MapR software version can be installed. However,
       rolling back a cluster from a newer MapR version to an older
       version is not supported.

   Applying a patch is a three-step process:

   When you apply a patch to the cluster, the patched files along with
   original files (non-patched) are copied to the /opt/mapr/.patch folder.
   In the /opt/mapr/.patch folder, the file ending with .O is the original
   file (non-patched) and the file ending with .<patch_number> is the
   patched version. Therefore, if there is a file under
   /opt/mapr/.patch/lib/, you can compare that with the corresponding file
   under /opt/mapr/lib/ by using the md5sum command to verify that the
   patch was successfully deployed.

   If you need more information or if you encounter any problems with
   patch installation, contact support@mapr.com.
