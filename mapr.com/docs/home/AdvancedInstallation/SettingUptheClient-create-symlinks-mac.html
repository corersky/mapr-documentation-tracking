Create Symlinks to Hadoop Directories for the Mac Client

   Run Hadoop commands using the hadoop2 keywords.
   Perform the following steps to create hadoop2 symlinks in the
   usr/local/bin directory for a MapR client on Mac OS X:
    1. Run the following commands as root to create the symlinks:
ln -s /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/bin/hadoop /usr/local/bin/hadoop2
ln -s /opt/mapr/bin/hadoop /usr/local/bin/hadoop
       Note: In the command above, replace hadoop-2.x.x with the actual
       hadoop 2 version number that you have installed.
    2. Add the Hadoop binaries to the PATH environment variable. For
       example, add the following text to the user login shell script such
       as ~/.bashrc:
export PATH=/opt/mapr/bin:/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/bin:/opt/mapr/hadoop/had
oop-0.20.2/bin:${PATH}
       Note: In the text above, replace hadoop-2.x.x with the actual
       hadoop 2 version number that you have installed.

   Now, you can [1]run hadoop commands using the hadoop1 and hadoop2
   keywords.
