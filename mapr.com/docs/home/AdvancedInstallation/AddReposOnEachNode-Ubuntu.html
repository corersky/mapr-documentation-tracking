Add the repository on each node

   Each node must contain your local repository.
    1. On each node, use one of the following methods to add the
       repository:
          + If you have installed the software-properties-common package,
            use the add-apt-repository utility to add the repository:

   CAPTION:

   MEP add-apt-repository 'deb
   https://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/ubuntu binary
   trusty'
   Core add-apt-repository 'deb
   https://package.mapr.com/releases/v<version>/ubuntu binary trusty'
          + If the software-properties-common package is not installed,
            create a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d whose content is a
            single line as follows:

   CAPTION:

   MEP deb https://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/ubuntu
   binary trusty
   Core deb https://package.mapr.com/releases/v<version>/ubuntu binary
   trusty
            Note: File names must end with .list and may only contain
            letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_), hyphen
            (-), and period (.) characters.
    2. On each node, update the package indexes (as root or with sudo).
       After performing these steps, you can use apt-get to install MapR
       software and Hadoop ecosystem components on each node from the
       local repository.
apt-get update
