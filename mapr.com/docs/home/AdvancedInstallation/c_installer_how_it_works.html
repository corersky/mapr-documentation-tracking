Using mapr-setup.sh

   This topic describes how you can use and run the MapR Installer setup
   script.

   Before you can run the MapR Installer, you must run the mapr-setup.sh
   script to set up the installation environment on a node that will be
   part of the cluster. Then, you can run the MapR Installer to perform
   the installation.

   To download and run the mapr-setup.sh script, see [1]MapR Installer.

mapr-setup.sh

   The mapr-setup.sh script performs the following steps to prepare the
   node to run the MapR Installer:
    1. Verifies and installs the operating system dependencies and Java
       requirements on the current node.
    2. Checks for Internet connectivity to the remote repository.
          + If access to [2]package.mapr.com is not available, the script
            prompts for MapR archive tarballs. Provide the full paths of
            these tarballs in a space-delimited list.
    3. Asks for the hostname and port that cluster nodes can use to
       connect to the MapR Installer node.
    4. Asks for the cluster admin user account and creates the account if
       it does not exist. This account must exist or be created on each
       node in the cluster.
    5. Sets up a custom yum or apt repository.
          + If no archive file is provided, the script configures access
            to the [3]package.mapr.com repository. For example, on RedHat
            / CentOS, the script creates the following remote repository:
            /etc/yum.repos.d/mapr.installer.repo
          + If archive files are provided, the script sets up a local
            repository.
    6. Starts the MapR Installer.

   Options

   Generally, run the mapr-setup.sh script without using any additional
   options. Only consider using the following options if you have a known
   Internet connectivity issue, your MapR Installer packages are not
   located in the default repository, or you need help with the
   installation process.
   Option Description
   docker client Use this option to create a MapR PACC image. For more
   information, see [4]Creating a MapR PACC Image Using mapr-setup.sh.
   docker installer Use this option to create a MapR Installer container.
   install Use this option to install the MapR Installer and definition
   files. If you don't specify an option for mapr-setup.sh, the install
   option is invoked by default.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh install

   reload Use this option to reinstall the MapR Installer and definition
   files. This option is helpful in debugging. No prompt is returned when
   you use this option.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh reload

   remove Use this option to remove the MapR Installer and definition
   files. This option does not remove the mapr-setup.sh script.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh remove

   update Use this option to update the installer packages. The setup
   script checks [5]package.mapr.com for new packages and installs the
   packages if they are available.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh update

   -a|--archives Use this option to bypass the Internet connectivity check
   and directly create a local repository. Specify a space-delimited list
   of the full paths to the following archive files (the order of the
   files is important) as an argument to the option:
     * MapR Installer archive
     * MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) archive
     * MapR archive for the current release

   For more information, see [6]Using a Local, Shared Repository With the
   MapR Installer.
   Note: Use this option when the MapR Installer node does not have access
   to the Internet or is behind a restricted VPN or firewall.
   Example for MapR 5.2 and later:
./mapr-setup.sh -a mapr-installer-v1.5.201705041557.deb.tgz
mapr-mep-v3.0.0.201704051422.deb.tgz mapr-v5.2.1GA.deb.tgz

   Example for MapR 5.0 and 5.1:
./mapr-setup.sh -a mapr-5.0-5.1.201705082100.deb.tar.gz

   For MapR 5.0 and 5.1, you only need to provide the MapR archive file.
   -h|--help Use this option to display the command-line help for the MapR
   Installer.
   Note: If you use this option with other options, the MapR Installer
   will ignore all options except for -h.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh -h

   -i|--install Use this option to override the MapR Installer packages
   stored in the remote or local repository. This option take a
   space-delimited list of the two local packages needed to install the
   MapR Installer (the order of the files is not important):
     * MapR Installer package
     * MapR Installer definitions package

   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh -i mapr-installer-definitions_1.5.201705021610_all.deb
mapr-installer_1.5.201705021610_all.deb

   -n|--noinet Use this option when you don't want mapr-setup.sh to fetch
   packages from the Internet. Instead of taking the files as an argument
   like -a, this option prompts you for a complete set of MapR archive
   files (the order of the files is important):
     * MapR Installer archive
     * MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) archive
     * MapR archive for the current release

   Note: Configure this option when the MapR Installer node does not have
   access to the Internet or is behind a restricted VPN or firewall. If
   you use this option together with -a, mapr-setup.sh will ignore -n.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh -n

   -p|--port This option specifies the hostname:port to use for
   installation-related communication between the MapR Installer node and
   other nodes in the cluster. The MapR Installer also adds the hostname
   provided as a default entry for the list of cluster nodes on the
   Configure Nodes page. Both the hostname and the port are not required
   when configuring this option; you can choose to configure one or both
   values.
   Note: Configure this option when the MapR Installer node has multiple
   interfaces or hostnames and the result of hostname is not a value that
   other nodes in the cluster are able to communicate with.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh -p perfnode131.perf.lab:9441

   -r|--repo When the MapR Installer packages are not located in the
   default repository, specify the top-level URL of the repository in
   which the MapR Installer packages are located. The default URL is
   [7]package.mapr.com.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh -r http://myrepo.download.pkgs/mapr/releases/

   -v Use this option when you want additional information about the setup
   process.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh -v

   -y|--yes Use this option to bypass the MapR Installer's usual prompts
   and immediately proceed with the default options. This option produces
   the same installation result as going through the mapr-setup.sh script
   prompts and choosing all of the default options, but with increased
   speed.
   Example:
./mapr-setup.sh -y

Stopping mapr-setup.sh

   If you need to stop mapr-setup.sh while it is running, press Ctrl + C.
   Depending on when you issue the Ctrl + C command, the script either
   stops or continues to execute until it is able to stop gracefully. You
   can run the script again or use the remove option, described earlier on
   this page, to remove the MapR Installer and definition files and then
   rerun the script.

   Another way to exit the script is to answer NO when the script prompts
   for a YES or NO reply. For example, when the script asks if you want to
   upgrade dependent packages, if you reply NO, the script exits.

After Running mapr-setup.sh

   To validate that the MapR Installer started correctly, do one of the
   following:
     * Log in to the MapR Installer web interface using the cluster admin
       user name and password.
     * Run the MapR Installer Stanza exportcommand using the cluster admin
       user name and password.

   If the MapR Installer does not start up correctly, check the logs. See
   [8]Logs for the MapR Installer.

   If you want to change any parameter that you provided to mapr-setup.sh
   on a previous run (for example, the repository URL, the cluster admin
   user name, or another parameter), you can safely rerun mapr-setup.sh
   with the new parameters. Doing so updates the MapR Installer
   configuration to use the new parameters. However, do not rerun
   mapr-setup.sh while an installation or a probe command is in progress.

MapR Installer Web Interface

   When you run the MapR Installer web interface, it performs the
   following tasks:
    1. Displays the MapR services and ecosystem components that you can
       install based on the MapR version that you select.
    2. Provides the option to install MapR Monitoring.
    3. Guides you through node and cluster configuration.
    4. Verifies that each node meets the node requirements.
    5. Sets a default, configurable service layout across the nodes in the
       cluster based on the requirements of each service.
    6. Installs or upgrades the MapR software and associated
       operating-system dependencies.
    7. If you chose to install a trial or community license, it will
       attempt to apply the license to your cluster.

MapR Installer Stanzas

   Running mapr-setup.sh also installs MapR Installer Stanzas. Stanzas
   give you a script-based tool to perform all the installation tasks you
   can perform using the MapR Installer web interface. See [9]MapR
   Installer Stanzas. In addition, Stanza commands make it possible to
   probe a cluster that was installed without using the MapR Installer and
   use the import command to set up the installer database. See [10]Using
   probe and import to Generate the Installer Database.

MapR Installer Components

   The MapR Installer uses the following components to set up the
   installation environment:
   Name Filename Description
   Configuration Script mapr-setup.sh Script that configures a node to run
   the MapR Installer. This includes setting up an Internet or local
   repository. The mapr-setup.sh script can also be used to create a MapR
   Persistent Application Client Container (PACC) or a MapR Installer
   Container. For more information, see
     * [11]Creating a MapR PACC Image Using mapr-setup.sh

   Installer Package mapr-installer-<version> Package that contains the
   MapR Installer.
   Installer Definitions Package mapr-installer-definitions-<version>
   Package that contains the list of MapR versions, services, and
   ecosystem components that you can install with the MapR Installer.
   MapR Service Packages various

   If you use a remote repository, the MapR Installer accesses the
   installation packages from [12]package.mapr.com.

   If you use a local repository, the MapR Installer accesses the
   installation packages from the local repository. The mapr-setup.sh
   script creates the local repository with the packages available in the
   archive files that you provide to the mapr-setup.sh script. For more
   information, see [13]Using a Local, Shared Repository With the MapR
   Installer.
