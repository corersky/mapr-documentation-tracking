Step 7: Bring up the Cluster

   Describes bringing up the cluster and adding a license.

   Bringing up the cluster involves starting ZooKeeper and Warden,
   installing a MapR license, and viewing the cluster installation status.
   Once these initial steps are done, the cluster is functional. You can
   use the MapR Control System Dashboard (MCS), or the MapR Command Line
   Interface (CLI), to examine nodes and activity on the cluster.
