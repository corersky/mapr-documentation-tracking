Step 7: Bring up the Cluster

   Before you can install metrics monitoring, log monitoring, or ecosystem
   components, you must enable the cluster by starting ZooKeeper and
   Warden and verifying the cluster installation status.

   Bringing up the cluster involves starting ZooKeeper and Warden,
   installing a MapR license, and viewing the cluster installation status.
   Once these initial steps are done, the cluster is functional. You can
   use the MapR Control System Dashboard (MCS), or the MapR Command Line
   Interface (CLI), to examine nodes and activity on the cluster.
