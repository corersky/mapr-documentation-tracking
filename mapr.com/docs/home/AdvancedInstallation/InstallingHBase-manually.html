   Service Description
   HBase Client

   After installing the HBase Client, you can use the HBase Shell to
   manipulate MapR Database tables. MapR Database also supports a number
   of HBase APIs for use with MapR Database binary tables. For information
   on installation and configuration, see [1]Installing HBase on a Client
   Node. For more information about MapR Database tables and HBase APIs,
   see [2]Developing Applications for Binary Tables.
   HBase Thrift Gateway

   HBase Thrift Gateway includes an API and a service that accepts Thrift
   requests to connect to MapR Database tables. For information on
   installation and configuration, see [3]Installing the HBase Thrift
   Gateway.
   HBase REST Gateway HBase REST Gateway includes an API and a service
   that accepts REST requests to connect to MapR Database tables. For
   information on installation and configuration, see [4]Installing the
   HBase REST Gateway.
   AsyncHBase Libraries AsyncHBase library provides asynchronous Java APIs
   to access MapR Database tables. For information on installation and
   configuration, see [5]Installing AsyncHBase Libraries.
