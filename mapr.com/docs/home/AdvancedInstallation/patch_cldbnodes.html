Step 3: Apply the Patch to CLDB Nodes

   When applying a patch manually, apply the patch to CLDB slave nodes
   prior to applying the patch on the master CLDB node. After you apply a
   patch to a CLDB node, you must verify that container 1 is fully
   replicated before proceeding to apply the patch to the next CLDB node.
   For large clusters with many containers, when you do not patch CLDB
   nodes in the prescribed order, there may be a considerable delay before
   the cluster can process client operations. For smaller clusters, this
   is not as critical as the cluster can generally start accepting client
   operations in about 5 minutes.

   Complete the following steps of each CLDB slave node and then on the
   CLDB master node:
    1. Stop the MapR Warden and ZooKeeper (if installed) services:
         a. To stop MapR Warden , run the following command:
sudo service mapr-warden stop
         b. If Zookeeper is installed on the node, run this command:
sudo service mapr-zookeeper stop
    2. If there is already a patch installed on the cluster, run one of
       the following commands to uninstall it:
          + On CentOS/Redhat: sudo rpm -e mapr-patch
          + On SUSE: sudo zypper remove mapr-patch
          + On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get -y remove mapr-patch
    3. Install the patch using one of the following commands:
          + On CentOS/RedHat: sudo rpm -ivh
            mapr-patch-<new_patch_number>.rpm
          + On SUSE: sudo zypper install mapr-patch-<new_patch_number>.rpm
          + On Ubuntu: sudo dpkg -i mapr-patch<new_patch_number>.deb
    4. Start the MapR Warden and ZooKeeper (if installed) services:
         a. If ZooKeeper is installed on the node, run this command to
            start ZooKeeper:
sudo service mapr-zookeeper start
         b. To start Warden, run this command:
sudo service mapr-warden start
    5. To verify that the patch was installed successfully, run one of the
       following commands:
          + On CentOS/Redhat or SUSE: sudo rpm -ql
            mapr-patch-<new_patch_number>
          + On Ubuntu: sudo dpkg -l | grep mapr-patch-<new_patch_number>
    6. Verify that the CLDB node that you patched is running and that
       container 1 on that node is fully replicated.
       Run maprcli dump containerinfo -ids 1 -json.
       In the output, the CLDB node that you just patched should be listed
       under ActiveServers and it should report a VALID state for
       container 1.
       For example:
...
      "data":[
             {
                "ContainerId":1,
                "Epoch":3,
                "Master":"<masterCLDB_IP>:5660--3-VALID",
                "ActiveServers":{
                  "IP:Port":[
                      "<masterCLDB_IP>:5660--3-VALID",
                      "<slaveCLDB_IP>:5660--3-VALID",
                      "<slaveCLDB_IP>:5660--3-VALID"
                   ]
              },
                  "InactiveServers":{
                   },
                  "UnusedServers":{
              },
...
       Note: The RESYNC state will display when container 1 is not fully
       replicated on that node. You must wait until the CLDB node that you
       just patched has a VALID state for container 1.
