Deleting an AWS Stack

   MapR resources in AWS are grouped together, making it easy for you to
   remove them. You can use the MapR Installer Destroy button to delete an
   AWS stack in one operation. The Destroy button appears when the MapR
   Installer detects cloud installations that were created using MapR
   scripts.

   You can also use AWS menu commands to delete an AWS stack. Because the
   MapR stack is an Auto Scaling Group, deleting it using AWS menu
   commands requires some extra steps. First, you must disable certain AWS
   processes that protect against shutting down the stack. Then you must
   delete the stack.

Delete an AWS Stack Using the Destroy Button

   To remove an AWS stack using the MapR Installer, you can use the
   Destroy button:
    1. Log in to the MapR Installer.
    2. On the status page, click the Destroy button. A confirmation box
       asks if you want to delete the MapR cluster.
    3. Click OK. The Authentication page appears:

    4. Enter your security credentials, and click Destroy. The Installer
       displays:
We will start to delete your cluster and all the resources associated with it. P
lease check the AWS console to verify that all resources were deleted successful
ly.
       You can monitor the status of stack deletion in the AWS console.

Delete Suspended Processes

   Use these steps if you want to delete your MapR stack using AWS menu
   commands. You do not need to use these steps if you use the MapR
   Installer Destroy button. To remove a MapR stack using AWS menu
   commands, you must delete suspended processes and then delete the
   stack.
    1. Click Services > EC2.
    2. In the left navigation pane, under Auto Scaling, click the link to
       Auto Scaling Groups.
    3. In the list of Auto Scaling Groups, find and select the name of
       your stack.
       Tip: Type the first few letters of the stack name in the Filter
       field to find the stack.
    4. Click the Details tab to select it.
    5. Click Edit.
    6. Scroll down to the Suspended Processes section:

    7. Click the "x" in each of the suspended processes to delete it.
    8. Click Save.

Delete the Stack

   You do not need to use these steps if you use the MapR Installer
   Destroy button. To remove an AWS stack manually, you must delete
   suspended processes and then delete the stack.
    1. Navigate to the CloudFormation section, and select your stack.
    2. From the Actions menu, select Delete Stack.
    3. To confirm the delete operation, click Yes, Delete.
