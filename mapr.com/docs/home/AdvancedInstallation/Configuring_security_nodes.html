Configuring Nodes with Security

   Describes how to configure security on all nodes during installation
   without the MapR Installer.
   Note: These steps configure your cluster for enhanced security. The
   procedure enables security for authentication, authorization, and data.
   If you do not want your cluster to be secure, do not perform the steps
   in this procedure. Go to [1]Configuring Nodes without Security.
    1. Run the configure.sh script with the -secure -genkeys options on
       the first CLDB node in your cluster:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -secure -genkeys -Z <Zookeeper_node_list> -C <CLDB
_node_list> [-RM <host>][-HS <host>][-L <logfile>][ â€‘N <cluster_name> ][ -F <dis
k_list> ]
       where:
          + Both <Zookeeper_node_list> and <CLDB_node_list> have the form
            hostname[:port_no][,hostname[:port_no]...].
          + -N <cluster_name> can be specified if the cluster is not yet
            named.
       Important: You run configure.sh -genkeys only once on one CLDB node
       because the resulting files will be copied to the other nodes.
       This command generates four files in the /opt/mapr/conf directory:
          + cldb.key
          + maprserverticket
          + ssl_keystore
          + ssl_truststore
    2. Copy the cldb.key file to any node that has the CLDB or Zookeeper
       service installed.
    3. Copy the maprserverticket, ssl_keystore, and ssl_truststore files
       to the /opt/mapr/conf directory of every node in the cluster.
    4. Verify that the files from the previous step are owned by the user
       that runs cluster services. This user is mapr by default. Also, the
       maprserverticket and ssl_keystore files must have their UNIX
       permission-mode bits set to 600, and the ssl_truststore file must
       be readable to all users.
    5. Run configure.sh -secure on all other nodes in the cluster using
       the same arguments as in Step 1 but without the -genkeys option.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -secure -Z <Zookeeper_node_list> -C <CLDB_node_lis
t> [-RM <host>][-HS <host>][-L <logfile>][ -N <cluster_name> ][ -F <disk_list> ]
       The -secure option indicates that wire-level security must be
       enabled on the node where the command is run. The -F <disk_list>
       option is needed only for nodes where the mapr-fileserver is
       installed.
       Important: You must also do this on any nodes that you add to the
       cluster in the future.
    6. Copy the ssl_truststore file to any client nodes outside the
       cluster.
       Important: If you run configure.sh -secure on a node before you
       copy the necessary files to that node, the command fails.
