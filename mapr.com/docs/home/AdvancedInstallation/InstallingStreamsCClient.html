Installing MapR-ES C Client

   The MapR-ES C Client is a distribution of librdkafka that works with
   MapR-ES.
     * For instructions on installing the MapR Client, see [1]Installing
       the MapR Client
     * For instructions on setting up the MEP repository, see [2]Step 10:
       Install Ecosystem Components Manually.

Installation

   As of MapR 6.0.1, the MapR C client is installed as part of the MapR
   Core installation and the mapr-client package installation. The MapR C
   client is available on Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems.
   Remember: Specific installation is not required as of MapR 6.0.1!
   For MapR 5.2.1 through MapR 6.0.0, the MapR C client must be installed.
   The MapR C client is available on Linux and Mac operating systems. As
   root or using sudo, install the mapr-librdkafka package on nodes where
   you want to run or build applications.
     * On Ubuntu:
apt-get install mapr-librdkafka
     * On RedHat/CentOS:
yum install mapr-librdkafka
     * On SUSE:
zypper install mapr-librdkafka
     * On Mac OS:
         1. Download the following TAR file:
            http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/<MEP version>/<operating
            system>/<package>.tar.gz
         2. Extract the TAR file under /opt/mapr:
tar -C /opt/mapr/ -zxf <librdkafka_tarFile_location>

   Note: The mapr-librdkafka package pulls in the mapr-client as a
   dependency if the node does not have the mapr-client or mapr-core
   package installed.

Configuration

   For MapR 6.0.1 and higher, use the following configuration
   instructions.

   Linux
          For Linux installations, add /opt/mapr/lib to the end of
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mapr/lib

   Mac
          For Mac installations, add /opt/mapr/lib to the end of
          DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/mapr/lib

   Windows
          For Windows installations, no additional configuration is
          required. Link your application and run your programs against
          the MapR Client dynampic link libraries (dll) located at:
          C:\opt\mapr\lib. The corresponding librdkafka header is
          C:\opt\mapr\include\librdkafka.

   Attention: For MapR 6.0.0 and earlier, see [3]Configuring the MapR-ES C
   Client for instructions on configuring the client.
