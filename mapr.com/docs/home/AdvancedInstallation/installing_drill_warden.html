Installing Drill to Run Under Warden

   This document provides instructions for manually installing the latest
   version of Drill to run under the MapR Warden service on the MapR
   Converged Data Platform.
   Note: Starting in Drill 1.11, Drill is automatically secured when
   installed in a 6.x MapR cluster with the default MapR security
   configuration. The default security configuration uses MapR security
   (mapr tickets) to provide authentication, authorization, and encryption
   for cluster security. See [1]Securing Drill amd [2]Component Versions
   for Released MEPs for more information.

   Complete the following steps as root or using sudo to install Drill on
   a client or server node:
    1. To install Drill, issue the command appropriate for your system:

        RedHat/CentOS

yum install mapr-drill

        Ubuntu

apt-get install mapr-drill

        SUSE

zypper install mapr-drill

       Note: SUSE is supported as of Drill 1.9.0-1703 and Drill
       1.10.0-1703.
    2. Run the configuration script to update the node configuration, as
       shown:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       Note: See [3]configure.sh for more information about the script.
    3. Verify that Drill is configured and running on the node. You can
       use one of the following methods to verify that the Drillbit
       service is running on the node:
          + Issue the following command to verify the status of the
            Drillbit service from the command line:
jps
          + Log in to the MCS at https://<host_name>:8443 to verify the
            status of the Drillbit service.
            Note: You should see the Drillbit listed as a service running
            on the node.
    4. Optionally, modify the Drill configuration. For example, you can
       change the log file directory, increase heap space and direct
       memory, or configure the MapR Filesystem as the persistent
       configuration storage. See [4]Configuring Drill.
       Note: You must restart the drillbit for the new configuration to
       take effect.
    5. Repeat steps 1 through 3 on any other nodes designated to run
       Drill.
       Note:
       You can start|stop|restart the Drillbit service on one or more
       nodes using the MCS or the following command:
$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action start|restart|stop -nodes <node
 host names separated by a space>
       Use the host name if possible. Using host names instead of IP
       addresses is a best practice.
       You can access the Drill log files in
       /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/logs/drillbit.log.
