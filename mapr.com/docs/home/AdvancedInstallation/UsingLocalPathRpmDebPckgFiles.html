Using a Local Path with rpm or deb Package Files

   This section describes how to make packages available through a local
   path.
   You can download package files, store them locally, and then install
   MapR from the files. This option is useful for clusters that are not
   connected to the internet.
   Warning: This method requires that you pre-install the MapR package
   dependencies on each node in order for MapR installation to succeed.

   See [1]Packages and Dependencies for MapR Software (MapR 6.0.0) for a
   list of the dependency packages required for the MapR services that you
   are installing. Manually download the packages and install them.

   To install MapR from downloaded package files, complete the following
   steps:
    1. Using a machine connected to the internet, download the tarball for
       the MapR components and the Hadoop ecosystem components,
       substituting the appropriate <platform>, <version>, and
       <datestamp>:
          + [2]http://package.mapr.com/releases/v6.x.x/<platform>/mapr-v<v
            ersion>GA.rpm.tgz (or .deb.tgz)
          + [3]http://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/MEP-<version>/<platfor
            m>/mapr-mep-<version>-<datestamp>.rpm.tgz (or .deb.tgz) (See
            [4]MapR Repositories and Package Archives for the correct
            paths for all past releases.)
    2. Extract the tarball to a local directory, either on each node or on
       a local network accessible by all nodes.
tar -xvzf mapr-<version>GA.rpm.tgz
tar -xvzf mapr-mep-<version>-<datestamp>.rpm.tgz
