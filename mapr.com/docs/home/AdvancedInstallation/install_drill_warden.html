Install Drill to Run Under Warden

   Verify that your system meets the prerequisites listed below and then
   follow the instructions listed in [1]Installing Drill to Run Under
   Warden to install the mapr-drill package on all nodes designated to run
   Drill under the MapR Warden service.
   Note: See [2]Component Versions for Released MEPs for version support
   in each MEP release.

Prerequisites

   Before you install Drill, read [3]Installing Drill, and verify that the
   system meets the following prerequisites:
     * The MapR cluster is installed and running. Installing Drill first
       can result in configuration issues
     * The MEP repository is configured. For instructions, see [4]Step 9:
       Install Ecosystem Components Manually.

   Refer to the [5]Apache Drill Release Notes and [6]Drill Release Notes
   for a list of known issues.

Hive and HBase Support

   Installation of a supported version of Hive is optional. Support
   differs, depending on the MapR Ecosystem Pack version that you install.
   See [7]Component Versions for Released MEPs for version support in each
   MEP release.
   Note: As of MapR 6.0, HBase is not supported.
