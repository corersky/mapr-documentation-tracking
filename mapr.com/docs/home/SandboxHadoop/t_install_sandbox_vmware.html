Installing the Sandbox on VMware Player or VMware Fusion

   Download the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop, and import the virtual machine
   into the VMware Player. Configure the network setting, and start the
   MapR Sandbox for Hadoop to access the MapR Control System and Hue
   interfaces.
   Complete the following steps to install and run the MapR Sandbox for
   Hadoop:
    1. Download the MapR Sandbox for Hadoop file to a directory on your
       machine. To access the file, go to
       [1]https://package.mapr.com/releases/, and select the directory for
       the latest MapR release. The file is located in the sandbox/
       directory for the release, as shown:
[2]https://package.mapr.com/releases/v6.1.0/sandbox/MapR-Sandbox-For-Hadoop-6.1.
0-vmware.ova
    2. Open the VMware Player, and select the Open a Virtual Machine
       option. If you are running VMware Fusion, select Import.
    3. Go to the directory where you downloaded the MapR Sandbox for
       Hadoop file, and select
       MapR-Sandbox-For-Hadoop-<version>-vmware.ova. The Import Virtual
       Machine window appears.
    4. In the Import Virtual Machine window, click Import. The virtual
       machine player imports the sandbox.
    5. Select Edit virtual machine settings and then select the Network
       Adapter option.
       Note: The correct setting depends on your network connectivity when
       you run the sandbox. In general, if you are going to use a wired
       Ethernet connection, select NAT. If you use ODBC or JDBC on a
       remote host, select Bridged Adapter. If you are going to use a
       wireless network, select Host-only or Bridged Adapter.
    6. Click OK to save the settings.
    7. Select the MapR-Sandbox-For-Hadoop-<version>_VM, and click Play
       virtual machine.
    8. When you see the maprdemo login:_ prompt, enter mapr and then enter
       mapr as the password.
       The message, Welcome to your MapR Demo virtual machine, appears.
    9. Verify that a DNS entry was created on the host machine for the
       virtual machine. If not, create the entry.
          + For Linux and Mac, create the entry in /etc/hosts.
          + For Windows, create the entry in the
            %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file. To edit and save the
            hosts file on Windows, you may need to log on as administrator
            and run an editor, such as Notepad.
       Example: 127.0.0.1 maprdemo
   10. Enter the following URLs in your browser address bar to access the
       Hue and MapR Control System interfaces, and enter mapr as the
       username and password:
          + MapR Control System - Enter https://localhost:8443 or
            https://127.0.0.1:8443 in the address bar.
            Note: If you encounter a warning message stating that your
            connection is not private, select the option to accept and
            continue to the MapR Control System.
          + Hue - Enter http://localhost:8888 or http://127.0.0.1:8888 in
            the address bar.
            Note: If you used a bridged adapter, the network generates and
            assigns an IP to the sandbox that you must use in place of
            127.0.0.1 or localhost in the URL. To get the IP address, log
            in to the sandbox, using Alt+F2 on Windows or Option+F5 on Mac
            or Linux. Enter root as the username and mapr as the password.
            Run the ifconfig command to get the sandbox IP address. The IP
            address is located in the inet address field. You can access
            the MCS and Hue interfaces using the IP address, as shown in
            the following examples:
               o MCS - https://192.168.1.104:8443
               o Hue - http://192.168.1.104:8888
       Alternatively, you can access the host via SSH using ssh
       mapr@localhost -p 2222.
