   Enhancements to Parallelism in Drill 1.11
          In previous versions of Drill, parallelism correlated with the
          number of tablets (table partitions) that MapR Database split a
          table into, and each tablet stored up to 4 GB of data. One minor
          fragment ran for each tablet. As of MapR 6.0 and Drill 1.11,
          parallelism correlates with the amount of data instead of the
          number of tablets. One minor fragment is created for
          approximately every 128 MB of data. For example, Drill creates
          32 minor fragments for 4 GB of data. The planner.slice_target
          option determines the number of minor fragments that run in
          parallel.
