What's New in MEP 3.0

   Provides a summary of the new functionality in MEP 3.0.

   MEP 3.0 provides a series of stability and security fixes for Spark and
   improves the speed of ETL and batch processing with a faster version of
   Hive.

New Features and Additions

   MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark
          The MapR-DB OJAI Connector for Apache Spark is a new API that
          makes it easier to build real-time or batch pipelines between
          your data and MapR-DB and leverage Spark within the pipeline.
          This feature includes:

          + Two new APIs that allow you to load data from a MapR-DB JSON
            table to a Spark RDD or save a Spark RDD to a MapR-DB JSON
            table
          + A custom partitioner that allows you to partition data for
            better performance
          + Data locality: when the connector reads data from MapR-DB, it
            uses the data locality feature of MapR-DB to spawn the Spark
            executors

          For more information, see [1]Understanding the MapR-DB OJAI
          Connector for Spark.

   MapR-DB Binary Connector for Apache Spark
          The new MapR-DB Binary Connector for Apache Spark allows you to
          write applications that consume HBase binary tables and use them
          in Spark. Features include:

          + Writing directly to HBase HFiles for bulk insertion into HBase
          + Spark SQL can draw on tables that are represented in HBase

          For more information, see [2]MapR-DB Binary Connector for Apache
          Spark.

   MapR-ES C Applications (librdkafka)
          As of MapR maintenance release 5.2.1, you can develop C
          applications for MapR-ES. The MapR-ES C Client is a distribution
          of librdkafka that integrates with MapR Streams.

          For more information, see [3]MapR-ES C Applications.

   MapR-ES Python Applications
          As of MapR 5.2.1, you can create Python applications for MapR-ES
          using the MapR Streams Python client. The Streams Python client
          is a binding for librdkafka and contains support for high-level
          consumers.

          For more information, see [4]MapR-ES Python Applications.

Key Upgrades

   Apache Spark 2.1.0
          Spark 2.1 in the MapR converged data platform brings
          improvements in enterprise-ready stability and security,
          including:

          + More than 1200 fixes on the Spark 2.x line
          + MapR-SASL support for encrypted Thrift-server connections
          + Scalable partition handling
          + Stable data-type APIs

          For more information, see [5]Spark Feature Support.

   Apache Hive 2.1.1
          MEP 3.0 provides a faster version of Hive to improve the speed
          of data-processing tasks, to reduce latency for interactive
          queries, and to increase throughput for batch queries. Key
          improvements include:

          + 2x faster ETL through an enhanced cost-based optimizer (CBO),
            faster type conversions, and dynamic partition pruning
          + New HiveServer UI with new diagnostics and monitoring tools
          + Dynamically partitioned hash joins, which provide unsorted
            inputs in order to eliminate the sorting step.
          + Vectorized query execution that greatly reduces the CPU usage
            for typical query operations, like scans, filters, aggregates,
            and joins

          For more information, see [6]Hive.

   Apache Drill 1.10
          Continuing on the iterative releases, Drill 1.10 is another
          important milestone for Apache Drill. Numerous enhancements have
          been added to this release for BI tool integration, end-to-end
          security, performance, and usability enhancements. Highlights of
          this release include:

          + Tableau native connectivity
          + Support for Kerberos and MapR-SASL authentication between the
            client and Drillbit
          + Support for the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE AS (CTTAS) command
          + Ability to query data with Hue 3.12 (experimental only)
          + Improved compatibility with Hive/Spark-generated Parquet files

          For more information, see the [7]Drill Introduction.
