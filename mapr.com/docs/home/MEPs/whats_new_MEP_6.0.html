What's New in MEP 6.0.0

   Provides a summary of the new functionality in MapR Ecosystem Pack
   (MEP) 6.0.0.

   MEP 6.0.0 provides you with support for MapR 6.1.0 and new features in
   MapR Database JSON; Amazon S3 API; and Apache Hadoop YARN, Kafka,
   Spark, Hive, Tez, Hue, Livy, Flume, Oozie, and Sqoop.

New Features in MapR Database JSON

   Node.js and Python OJAI Clients
          With MEP 6.0.0, you can use the Node.js and Python OJAI clients
          to write MapR Database JSON applications. These clients provide
          lightweight libraries that support the OJAI API and alternatives
          to the Java OJAI client. You can connect to MapR Database JSON
          from middleware components, and add, update, and query documents
          in a MapR Database JSON table. Both clients tailor their
          features to developers of those respective languages.

          The following topics provide more information about these
          clients:

          + [1]Using the Node.js OJAI Client
          + [2]Using the Python OJAI Client

New Features in Apache Kafka

   Support for Apache Kafka Streams
          Kafka Streams is a programming library that enables you to
          create Java or Scala streaming applications and, specifically,
          building streaming applications that transform input topics into
          output topics.

          Kafka Streams enables you to build moderately complex
          operational streaming applications faster by offloading common
          functions such as failure recovery, joins and enrichment, and
          aggregations and windowing.

          See [3]Kafka Streams and [4]Kafka Streams 1.1-1808 Release Notes
          for more information.

   Support for Apache Kafka KSQL
          Streaming SQL for Apache Kafka (KSQL) is an open source
          streaming SQL engine that implements continuous, interactive
          queries. KSQL enables you to query, read, write, and process
          data in real time and scale, using SQL commands. KSQL interacts
          directly with the Kafka Streams API, removing the requirement of
          building a Java application. See [5]KSQL and [6]KSQL 4.1.1-1808
          Release Notes for more information.

New Ecosystem Component

   Support for MapR Object Store with S3-Compatible API
          The MapR Object Store with S3-Compatible API (MapR Object Store)
          provides you with a REST interface compatible with the Amazon S3
          API standard to store and retrieve data from the MapR platform
          object store in the form of files. For more information, see
          [7]MapR Object Store with S3-Compatible API.

New Features in YARN

   YARN Resource Calculation Based on Labels
          MEP 6.0.0 implements correct steady and instantaneous fair
          shares, headroom, and maximum resource calculation for queues
          with label-based scheduling (LBS). For more information, see
          [8]YARN Resource Calculation Based on Labels.

   Support for Azure Data Lake Store
          You can use Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS) as an input source or
          an output destination for all applications. For more
          information, see [9]Support for ADLS.

New Features in Spark

   New Spark Version
          MEP 6.0.0 includes support for Spark 2.3.1. For more
          information, see [10]Spark 2.3.1-1808 (MEP 6.0.0) Release Notes.

New Features in Hive and Tez

   New Hive and Tez Versions
          MEP 6.0.0 includes support for Hive 2.3 and Tez 0.9. For more
          information, see [11]Hive 2.3 and Tez 0.9. You can also refer to
          [12]Hive 2.3.3-1808 (MEP 6.0.0) Release Notes and [13]Tez
          0.9.1-1808 (MEP 6.0.0) Release Notes.

   Support for UPDATE, INSERT INTO, and MERGE statements in Hive

          + You can use the UPDATE statement to update primitive, complex,
            and complex nested data types in MapR Database JSON tables,
            using the Hive connector.
            For more information, see [14]Understanding the UPDATE
            Statement.
          + You can use the INSERT INTO statement to insert or overwrite
            rows in nested MapR Database JSON tables, using the Hive
            connector.
            For more information, see [15]Understanding the INSERT INTO
            Statement.
          + You can use the MERGE statement to efficiently perform
            record-level INSERT and UPDATE operations within Hive tables.
            For more information, see [16]Understanding the MERGE
            Statement.

   Support for Splitting Hive Log Files
