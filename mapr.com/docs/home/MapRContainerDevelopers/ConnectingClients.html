Connecting Clients to the MapR Container for Developers

   You can access the MapR cluster running in the MapR Container for
   Developers from your laptop. Simply issue client commands from your
   laptop.

Setting up New Users

   The MapR Container for Developers is setup with only users mapr and
   root. If you want to connect clients as some other user, you must add
   your user name and group to the container.

   For example, if running the id command on your laptop returns the
   following:
uid=5001(mapruser) gid=5000(maprgroup)

   Then, run the following commands to add your user name and group to the
   container:
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
groupadd -g 5000 maprgroup
useradd -m -u 5001 -gmaprgroup mapruser

Accessing the File System

   The following command lists the files in MapR file system on the
   cluster:
/opt/mapr/bin/hadoop fs -ls /

Accessing MapR Database

   To access MapR Database, you can use MapR Database shell:
/opt/mapr/bin/mapr dbshell

   In MapR Database shell, you can create a table, insert into the table,
   and read from the table:
create /tmp/t1
insert /tmp/t1 --v '{"a":"ABC"}' --id "ID1"
find /tmp/t1

Accessing Drill

   The MapR client downloaded in the [1]Prerequisites to Running the MapR
   Container for Developers topic includes a minimum set of clients. To
   run other clients, you must first copy the client software to your
   laptop.

   The following example shows how to do this for Apache Drill 1.14.0:
    1. Determine your Docker <container-id> by examining the output of the
       docker ps command
    2. Copy Drill from your container to your laptop specifying the
       <container-id>:
docker cp <container-id>:/opt/mapr/drill /opt/mapr/drill
    3. Connect to Drill as user mapr through JDBC by running sqlline:
/opt/mapr/drill/drill-1.14.0/bin/sqlline -u "jdbc:drill:drillbit=localhost" -n m
apr
       Note: If you are using a different version of Drill, replace the
       version string with your version.
    4. Run a SQL query in sqlline:
select * from cp.`employee.json` limit 10;

Demo Applications

   Sample applications are available at
   [2]https://github.com/mapr-demos/mapr-db-60-getting-started. The
   applications show you how to access a MapR Database JSON table using
   the following programming interfaces:
     * [3]Drill JDBC
     * [4]OJAI
     * [5]Understanding the MapR Database OJAI Connector for Spark

   See the [6]README file in the github repository for detailed steps on
   how to create the data used in the applications and how to run the
   applications.
