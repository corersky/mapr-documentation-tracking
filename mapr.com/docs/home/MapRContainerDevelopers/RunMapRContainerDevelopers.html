Running the MapR Container for Developers Script

   The MapR Container for Developers script,
   mapr_devsandbox_container_setup.sh, downloads the docker image
   associated with the container and launches the container image that
   starts the MapR cluster. It also performs the configuration steps
   needed to connect local MapR clients to the MapR cluster running in the
   container.
    1. Download mapr_devsandbox_container_setup.sh from
       [1]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mapr-demos/mapr-db-60-getting-
       started/master/mapr_devsandbox_container_setup.sh
    2. Modify the script so it is executable:
chmod +x mapr_devsandbox_container_setup.sh
    3. Run the script:
./mapr_devsandbox_container_setup.sh
       Note: The script may take 5-10 minutes to run the first time run
       it. It requires downloading the docker image from the docker
       repository.
    4. When the docker image is running, you will see the following
       output:
Docker Container is coming up....
Mac Client has been configured with the docker container.

Please login to the container using (root password mapr): ssh root@localhost -p
2222
Login to MCS at https://localhost:8443
    5. Log in to the docker container:
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
    6. Wait for the AdminApplication java process to start by viewing the
       output from jps:
root@maprdemo:~# jps
3472 WardenMain
28369 Jps
5105 CLDB
13810 RunJar
28259 FsShell
13235 AdminApplication
3232 QuorumPeerManager
12280 Drillbit
14122 RunJar
    7. When AdminApplication is running, you can access the MapR Control
       System (MCS) in your browser using the following URL:
https://localhost:8443
    8. After all MapR services are running, you can access MapR-FS using
       POSIX commands, with /mapr as your mount point. The following steps
       show you how to determine that all services are running:
         a. Determine the id of your docker container by examining the
            output from the following command:
docker ps
         b. Examine the contents of the docker logs using the container id
            from Step 8a:
docker logs ca2c94d9e822
         c. It may take a few minutes for all services to initialize,
            depending on the load in your environment. Output similar to
            the following in your log output indicates that all services
            are running:
This container IP : 172.17.0.2
         d. Log in to the container using the command from Step 5
         e. Run the following command to access MapR-FS using ls:
root@maprdemo:~# ls /mapr

   Note: Whenever you change your network environment, you must
   reconfigure your container. Rerun the
   mapr_devsandbox_container_setup.sh script and select option 2 when the
   script shows the following prompt:
MapR sandbox container is already running.
1. Kill the earlier run and start a fresh instance
2. Reconfigure the client and the running container for any network changes
Please enter choice 1 or 2 :
