MapR Container for Developers

   The MapR Container for Developers is a Docker container that enables
   you to create a single-node MapR cluster. The container is lightweight
   and designed to run on your laptop. It requires no additional
   configuration for you to connect your clients, also running on your
   laptop, to the cluster.

   The MapR cluster created by the Docker image includes the following
   components:
     * MapR Core 6.1
          + [1]MapR XD Distributed File and Object Store
          + [2]MapR Database
          + [3]MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
          + [4]MapR Control System
          + [5]MapR NFS
     * Apache Drill 1.14.0-1808
     * Apache Spark 2.3.1-1808

   You can run the container only on Mac OS X. Other operating systems are
   not supported.

   After you deploy the container, the environment inside the container
   runs Ubuntu16 and JDK 8. By default, the MapR cluster is configured as
   non-secure.

   The MapR Container for Developers is provided as is for development
   purposes. MapR technical support is not available for this product.
   However, users may post questions or comments on the [6]MapR Community.
