MapR Container for Developers

   The MapR Container for Developers is a Docker container that enables
   you to create a single node MapR cluster. The container is lightweight
   and designed to run on your laptop. It requires no additional
   configuration for you to connect your clients, also running on your
   laptop, to the cluster.

   The MapR cluster created by the Docker image includes the following
   components:
     * MapR Core 6.0
          + [1]MapR-XD
          + [2]MapR Database
          + [3]MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
          + [4]MapR Control System
          + [5]MapR NFS
     * Apache Drill 1.11.0-1710
     * Apache Spark 2.1.0-1710

   The container runs Ubuntu16 and JDK 8. By default, the cluster is
   configured as non-secure.

   The container currently runs only on Mac OS X.
