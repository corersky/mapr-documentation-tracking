Troubleshooting the MapR Container for Developers

   This section describes problems you may encounter when deploying,
   running, and accessing the MapR Container for Developers. It also
   includes steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problems.

Docker Login Problems

   Problem
          Attempting to log in to your Docker container returns the
          following error:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!    @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

   Possible Cause
          You have an old ssh key in your .ssh/known_hosts file

   Solution
          Replace the old ssh key with the correct key:

ssh-keygen -R [localhost]:2222

Docker Failures

   Problem
          Docker fails to run the container

   Possible Cause
          Docker encounters problems starting Zookeeper or Warden

   Solution

         1. Determine your Docker <container-id> by examining the output
            of the docker ps command
         2. Examine the Docker log files by running:
docker logs <container-id>
         3. Examine the MapR log files specified in the output for further
            diagnostics. You need to log in to the container to see those
            files.

   Problem
          Docker completes its startup as shown by the following output
          from Docker logs:

This container IP : 172.17.0.2

          But Docker is killed before MapR processes are running.

   Possible Cause
          You have not allocated enough memory to Docker

   Solution
          Make sure you have configured Docker with at least 6 GB of
          memory as described at [1]Step 2c at Prerequisites to Running
          the MapR Container for Developers.

MapR Connection Problems

   Problem
          Unable to connect to MCS in your browser

   Possible Cause Solution
   The AdminApplication process is not running yet

   Run jps and wait for AdminApplication to appear in the list of running
   java processes
   You are accessing an older, cached copy of the MCS URL Clear your
   browser cache and retry connecting to the URL

Unable to Access MapR Database Table

   Problem
          You cannot access a MapR Database table

   Possible Cause
          You do not have permissions on the volume where the table is
          stored

   Solution
          When creating a volume, make sure you set up the user access
          controls appropriately. See [2]Creating a Volume for details.

Unable to run OJAI Queries Due to Query Service Errors

   Problem
          When running an OJAI query, you encounter an error indicating
          that the Query Service is not enabled.

   Possible Cause
          The MapR cluster running in the container is setup with only
          users mapr and root. You are running as some other user and your
          query requires the [3]OJAI Distributed Query Service.

   Solution
          Add your user name to the MapR cluster node by running useradd
          as described at [4]Managing Users and Groups.
