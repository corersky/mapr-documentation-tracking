configure.sh

   Run configure.sh to [1]set up a MapR cluster node, or to [2]set up a
   MapR client node for communication with one or more clusters. You can
   also run configure.sh to update the configuration of a node. For
   example, you can use configure.sh to [3]change the services running on
   a node or specify the [4]user that runs MapR services.
   Note: On a Windows client, the configure.sh script is named
   configure.bat. It requires the -c parameter and does not accept the -Z
   parameter, but otherwise works in a similar way.

Steps Performed by configure.sh

   Each time configure.sh is run, it performs the following steps:
     * Updates /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf with the cluster name. It
       creates or modifies a line in /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf
       containing a cluster name followed by a list of CLDB nodes. New
       entries are added to mapr-clusters.conf when the cluster name
       passed to the -N parameter is different from the existing cluster
       name in that file.
     * Checks that the node has at least 4GB of RAM and that the /tmp and
       /opt partitions each have at least 1 GB of free space. If these
       conditions are not met, the script asks for confirmation before
       continuing.
     * Disables standard NFS daemons. If the node has the mapr-nfs role,
       the script disables the standard Linux NFS daemon because both NFS
       processes cannot run on the same node.
     * Updates additional *.conf and *.xml files related to the cluster
       and the services running on the node. For example, yarn-site.xml,
       warden.conf, and cldb.conf may be updated based on input to
       configure.sh.
     * On cluster nodes, it creates a group named shadow, adds the MapR
       user to this group, and then enables members of the shadow group to
       view the etc/shadow file. Read access to the etc/shadow file
       enables MapR users to authenticate with the MapR cluster.
     * Starts newly installed services. As long as Warden is running at
       the time you run configure.sh, new services are started.
     * All changes of configuration options or system files are logged to
       /opt/mapr/logs/configure.log. You can use the -L parameter to
       specify a different log file name.

   When you include disk-setup options (-D or -F) on nodes with the
   mapr-fileserver role, the script also performs the following steps:
     * Runs disksetup to create the disktab file. configure.sh takes the
       values you specify in the -disk-opts option and passes the value to
       disksetup. For example, if you include -disk-opts FW5 when you run
       configure.sh, configure.sh runs disksteup -F -W5. If disksetup
       fails, configure.sh exits with an error.
     * Starts Zookeeper and Warden. When the configure.sh script starts
       services, the message starting <servicename> is echoed to the
       standard output, to enable the user to see which services are
       starting. When Warden starts, Warden and ZooKeeper services are
       added to the inittab file as the first available inittab IDs,
       enabling these services to restart automatically upon failure.
       Note: You can specify the -no-autostart option to prevent the
       script from starting Zookeeper or Warden when you run configure.sh
       with the -F or -D options.

Options

   Option Description
   -C Use the -C option only for CLDB servers that have a single IP
   address each. This option takes a list of the CLDB nodes that this
   machine uses to connect to the MapR cluster. The list is in the
   following format:
hostname[:port_no][,hostname[:port_no]...]

   -c Specifies client setup. The -C option is required and -Z is
   optional. See [5]Setting Up the Client.
   -EZ The -EZ option is optional when configuring the cluster and is not
   applicable when configuring a client. This option takes a
   comma-separated list of the external IP addresses of the ZooKeeper
   nodes in the cluster. The list is in the following format:
hostname[:port_no][,hostname[:port_no] ...]

   -M Use the -M option only for multihomed CLDB servers that have more
   than one IP address. This option takes a list of the multihomed CLDB
   nodes that this machine uses to connect to the MapR cluster. The list
   is in the follwing format:
hostname[:port_no][,[hostname[:port_no]...]]

   -R After initial node configuration, specifies that configure.sh should
   use the previously configured ZooKeeper and CLDB nodes. The -C and -Z
   parameters are not required when -R is specified. When -R is specified,
   the CLDB credentials are read from mapr-clusters.conf and the ZooKeeper
   credentials are read from warden.conf. Use the -R option when you make
   changes to the services configured on a node without changing the CLDB
   and ZooKeeper nodes. Specify the --noRecalcMem parameter to skip
   recalculating memory settings when refreshing roles.
   -Z The -Z option is required unless -c (lowercase) or -R is specified.
   This option takes a list of the ZooKeeper nodes in the cluster. The
   list is in the following format:
hostname[:port_no][,hostname[:port_no]...]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   -certdomain Specifies a DNS domain for generated SSL wildcard
   certificates. This domain overrides the default DNS domain.
   --create-user | -a Create a local user to run MapR services, using the
   specified user from -u or the environment variable $MAPR_USER.
   -D Specifies a comma-delimited [6]list of disks to use with the MapR
   file system. With the -D option, you cannot specify partitions. By
   default, the configure.sh script automatically starts cluster services
   after configuration finishes successfully. If you do not want cluster
   services to be restarted, include the -no-autostart option along with
   the -D option.
   -d The host and port of the MySQL database to use for storing MapR
   Metrics data.
   -dare Enables on-disk encryption at the cluster-level. When run on the
   first CLDB node with the -genkeys option, the utility generates the
   data-at-rest encryption master key file at
   /opt/mapr/conf/dare.master.key.
   -defaultdb Sets the default database (HBase or MapR Database) that
   HBase clients connect to. Since Apache HBase is deprecated, there will
   be no HBase services (mapr-hbase-regionserver, mapr-hbase-master)
   installed on the cluster; therefore, this parameter will default to
   MapR Database.
   -disk-opts Enables you to specify a series of [7]disksetup formatting
   options. Do not include spaces or commas between the disksetup options.
   For example, you can specify -disk-opts FW5 to format the disks (F) and
   configure five disks per storage pool (W5).
   -dp Specifies the password for logging into the MySQL database used for
   storing MapR Metrics data.
   -ds Specifies the name of the database schema to use for the MySQL
   database used for storing MapR Metrics data. The default schema name is
   metrics.
   -du Specifies the username for logging into the MySQL database used for
   storing MapR Metrics data.
   -EC Specifies a host or hosts that contain the Hive Metastore. Use this
   parameter and the ‑hiveMetastoreHost argument to configure an ecosystem
   component, such as Drill, to communicate with the Hive Metastore. You
   can specify a single host or a comma-separated list of hosts. The list
   of hosts should use the following format:
hostname[:port_no][,hostname[:port_no]...]

   See the -EC parameter example later on this page. If you do not specify
   a host port number, Drill uses the default Hive Metastore port number
   (9083) for every host.
   -EP Specifies an option that is passed directly to an ecosystem
   configure.sh script. These commands follow the form ‑EP<ecosystem
   component name> <option>. In general, ‑EP options are not documented
   and should be used only if the documentation specifically instructs you
   to use them.
   In MapR 6.0 and later, some ecosystem components have their own
   configure.sh scripts, and the server configure.sh script or a user can
   pass options directly to the ecosystem component by using the ‑EP
   syntax. For example, in this command:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R -EPkibana '-kibanaPort 5610'

   -EPkibana '-kibanaPort 5610' changes the default port for Kibana to
   5610.

   Because ecosystem components are updated more frequently than MapR Core
   (which contains the server configure.sh script) implementing some
   configure.sh functions through an ecosystem configure.sh can accelerate
   the introduction of new features.
   -ES Specifies a comma-separated list of host names or IP addresses that
   identify the Elasticsearch nodes. The Elasticsearch nodes can be part
   of the current MapR cluster or part of a different MapR cluster. Do not
   use this option when you configure a node for the first time. Use this
   option along with the -R parameter.
   The list is in the following format:
hostname/IPaddress[:port_no][,hostname/IPaddress[:port_no]...]

   Note: The default Elasticsearch port is 9200. If you want to use a
   different port, specify the port number when you list the Elasticsearch
   nodes.
   -ESDB Specifies a non-default location for writing index data on
   Elasticsearch nodes. In order to configure an index location, you only
   need to include this parameter on Elasticsearch nodes.
   Note: Elasticsearch requires a lot of disk space. Therefore, a separate
   file system for the index is recommend. It is not recommended to store
   index data under the / or the /var file system.
   For more information, see [8]Log Aggregation and Storage
   -F Specifies a path to a text file that [9]specifies the disks and
   partitions to use with the MapR file system. By default, the
   configure.sh script automatically starts cluster services after
   configuration finishes successfully. If you do not want cluster
   services to be restarted, include the -no-autostart option along with
   the -F option.
   -f Specifies that the node should be configured without the system
   prerequisite check.
   ‑forceSecurityDefaults Instructs configure.sh to undo any custom
   security settings for a cluster and reconfigure security to the default
   MapR values for -unsecure or -secure. You must specify either the
   -secure or the -unsecure option. Using the ‑forceSecurityDefaults
   option causes the /opt/mapr/conf/.customSecure file to be removed. Use
   this syntax:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -forceSecurityDefaults [ -unsecure | -secure ] -C
<CLDB_node> -Z <ZK_node>

   For more information, see [10]Customizing Security in MapR.
   Important: It is possible that the -forceSecurityDefaults operation
   might not undo all custom security settings since configure.sh cannot
   know all of the custom settings that were implemented. Therefore, some
   hand editing of configuration files and settings might be required to
   restore the cluster to full functionality.
   -G The group ID to use when creating $MAPR_USER with the -create-user
   or -a option; corresponds to the -g or -gid option of the useradd
   command in Linux.
   -g The group name under which MapR services will run.
   -genkeys Generates needed keys and certificates for the initial CLDB
   node in a secure cluster. If specified with the -dare option, on the
   first CLDB node, generates a master key at
   /opt/mapr/conf/dare.master.key. Without the master key, the cluster
   cannot be started and data cannot be accessed.
   -H Specifies the HTTPS port number for connecting to the CLDB. The
   default port is 7443.
   -HS Specifies the IP or hostname of the node in the cluster that has
   the HistoryServer role. This parameter is required when a node in the
   cluster contains the HistoryServer role. In MapR 5.1 and later, this
   parameter is expanded to support the Mesos DNS-style name with format
   for Job History. The format is <myriad-fwk-name>.mesos. For example, if
   the -MF parameter is myriadA, the name is: jobhistory.myriadA.mesos.
   --isvm Specifies the virtual machine setup. Required when configure.sh
   is run on a cluster node that is on a virtual machine. This option
   configures the script to use less memory.
   -J Specifies the [11]JMX port for the CLDB. Default: 7220
   -K | -kerberosEnable Indicates that [12]Kerberos security has been
   enabled. Kerberos security is disabled by default.
   -L Specifies a log file. If not specified, configure.sh logs errors to
   /opt/mapr/logs/configure.log.
   -logHTTPFS Specifies the hostname to enable centralized logging via
   fluentd.
   -MCL Specifies the top-level directory where all the staging data as
   well as shuffle data is written for a specific Myriad framework. Used
   when multiple clusters are implementing Myriad.
   -MF Specifies the name of the Myriad framework that is displayed in the
   Mesos UI.
   -MHA Enables Myriad high availability.
   -M7 Deprecated as of MapR 4.0.1.
   -maprpam When specified, the configure.sh script installs the MapR
   version of Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This option is
   ignored if -S is not set.
   -N

   Specifies the cluster name. If you do not specify a name, configure.sh
   applies a default name (my.cluster.com) to the cluster. Whenever you
   run configure.sh, be aware of the existing cluster name or names in
   mapr-clusters.conf and specify the -N parameter accordingly. If you
   specify a name that does not exist, a new line is created in
   mapr-clusters.conf and treated as a configuration for a separate
   cluster.

   Subsequent runs of configure.sh without the -N parameter operate on
   this default cluster. If you specify a name when you first run
   configure.sh, you can modify the CLDB and ZooKeeper settings
   corresponding to the named cluster by specifying the same name and
   running configure.sh again. Whenever you need to re-run configure.sh on
   a given cluster (to add or rename nodes, for example), be sure to
   specify the same cluster name that you used when you ran configure.sh
   for the first time.
   -no-autostart Specifies that the script should not start Zookeeper or
   Warden when you run configure.sh.
   -no-auto-permission-update Pass this option to prevent MapR from
   silently altering permissions in /etc/shadow.
   -nocerts When specified, the configure.sh script does not generate SSL
   certificates even when the -genkeys option is specified.
   -noDB Specifies that MapR Database is not in use.
   -noRecalcMem Skip recalculating memory settings when refreshing roles.
   Can be used only with the -R option.
   -OT Specifies a comma-separated list of host names or IP addresses that
   identify the OpenTSDB nodes. The OpenTSDB nodes can be part of the
   current MapR cluster or part of a different MapR cluster. Do not use
   this option when you configure a node for the first time. Use this
   option along with the -R parameter. A Warden service must be running
   when you use configure.sh -R -OT.
   The hostname list should use the following format:
hostname/IP address[:port_no][,hostname/IP address[:port_no]...]

   Note: The default OpenTSDB port is 4242. If you want to use a different
   port, specify the port number when you list the OpenTSDB nodes.
   -on-prompt-cont Specify:
     * y to automatically respond Yes to all prompts.
     * n to automatically respond No to all prompts.

   -P Specifies the Kerberos instance which is used to form a CLDB
   Kerberos principal in the form of mapr/<instance-name>@<realm-name>.
   Enclose this value in quotes ("). This value is ignored if Kerberos
   security is not enabled.
   -QS Use the -QS option to configure the OJAI Distributed Query Service.
   See [13]Configure the OJAI Distributed Query Service.
   -RM

   In MapR 5.1, this parameter is expanded to support the Mesos DNS-style
   hostname for Myriad configuration. The Mesos-style hostname is
   <application name>.marathon.mesos. When starting ResourceManager from
   Marathon, the <application name> rm, for example, rm.marathon.mesos.

   In MapR 4.0.2, this parameter is not required unless you want to
   configure manual or automatic failover; zero configuration failover is
   enabled by default. In MapR 4.0.1, this parameter specifies the nodes
   in the cluster with the ResourceManager role.

   List the nodes in the following format: hostname[,hostname]...]

   For more information, see [14]ResourceManager High Availability.
   -S | -secure Specifies that this cluster is a secure cluster,
   configuring security on the platform and on all ecosystem components
   that support security. Default: unsecure.
   -syschk configures the system checks to be enabled or disabled. Value:
   Y/N
   -TL Specifies the single node on which the timeline server is installed
   for the Hive-on-Tez user interface. When you install Tez manually, you
   must also install the timeline server and run configure.sh -TL
   <timeline_server_node> on all nodes to indicate where the timeline
   server resides.
   -U The user ID to use when creating $MAPR_USER with the --create-user
   or -a option; corresponds to the -u or --uid option of the useradd
   command in Linux.
   -u The user name under which MapR services will run.
   -unsecure Specifies that this cluster is not secure. Default: unsecure.
   -v In addition to logging information, also prints to stdout.

Examples

   Add a node (not CLDB or ZooKeeper) to a cluster that is running the
   CLDB and ZooKeeper on three nodes:

   On the new node, run the following command:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C nodeA,nodeB,nodeC -Z nodeA,nodeB,nodeC

   Configure a client to work with cluster my.cluster.com, which has one
   CLDB at nodeA:

   On a Linux client, run the following command:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N my.cluster.com -c -C nodeA

   On a Windows 7 client, run the following command:
C:\opt\mapr\server\configure.bat -N my.cluster.com -c -C nodeA

   Add a second cluster to the configuration:

   On a node in the second cluster your.cluster.com, run the following
   command:
configure.sh -C nodeZ -N your.cluster.com -Z <zkNodeA,zkNodeB,zkNodeC>

   Add CLDB servers with multiple IP addresses to a cluster:

   In this example, the cluster my.cluster.com has CLDB servers at nodeA,
   nodeB, nodeC, and nodeD. The CLDB servers nodeB and nodeD have two NICs
   each at eth0 and eth1.

   On a node in the cluster my.cluster.com, run the following command:

   configure.sh -N my.cluster.com -C nodeAeth0,nodeCeth0 -M
   nodeBeth0,nodeBeth1 -M nodeDeth0,nodeDeth1 -Z zknodeA
   Start a cluster in secure mode using configure.sh

   In this example, the cluster my.cluster.com has two CLDB servers at
   nodeA and nodeB. The ZooKeeper node for this cluster is at nodeC. To
   start the cluster in secure mode, run the following command on nodeA:

   configure.sh -N my.cluster.com –C nodeA,nodeB –Z nodeC –secure –genkeys
   –F <disklist file>

   This command creates the ssl_truststore, ssl_keystore,
   maprserverticket, and cldb.key files. Copy those files from nodeA's
   /opt/mapr/conf directory to nodeB's /opt/mapr/conf directory.

   On nodeB, change the permissions on the ssl_keystore, maprserverticket,
   and cldb.key files to 600 (the mapr user) by using the following
   command:

   chmod 600 ssl_keystore maprserverticket cldb.key

   On the ssl_truststore file, change the permissions to 644 (world
   readable):

   chmod 644 ssl_truststore

   On nodeB, run the following command:

   configure.sh –N mycluster.com –C nodeA,nodeB –Z nodeC –secure –F
   <disklist file>
   Configure the Drill storage plugin to communicate with a Hive
   Metastore:

   This example uses the -EC parameter to configure the Drill storage
   plugin to communicate with a Hive Metastore located on nodeA:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -EC '-hiveMetastoreHost nodeA'
