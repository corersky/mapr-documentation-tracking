MapR-DB Binary DiffTables

   Compares the row key, column family, timestamp, and value of each table
   cell in each specified Mapr-DB table. Then, it generates one or two
   directories with [1]sequence files that you can use to either make a
   MapR-DB table identical to its master or merge the rows from two
   MapR-DB tables.

   Sequence files are binary flat files. To convert the sequence file into
   a format that is easier to understand, use the [2]FormatResults
   utility.

   By default, the DiffTables utility considers both the source table and
   the destination table to be a master table. Therefore, it generates two
   directories with sequence files. These sequence files contain the puts
   required to update each table so that it contains a superset of the
   rows defined in both tables at the time at which the utility was run.

   When you specify a master table, the DiffTables utility generates one
   of the following output directories:
     * opsForDst. A directory containing sequence files that correspond to
       each put and delete required to make the destination table
       identical to the source table.
     * opsForSrc. A directory containing sequence files that correspond to
       each put and delete required to make the source table identical to
       the destination table.

   A user with write permissions on a table can run the hbase
   org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.Import command to implement the puts
   and deletes specified in the sequence files.

Required Permissions

   The user that runs the DiffTables utility must have the following
   permissions:
     * The permission readAce on the volumes where the tables are located.
     * The permission for column reads (readperm) on each table.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [3]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on tables, see [4]Enabling
   Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.DiffTables
  -src <source table path>
    -dst <destination table path>
      -outdir <output directory>
    [-master <src|dst> ] The master table to use for the diff.
    [-first_exit] Exit when first difference is found.
    [-columns <comma separated list of family[:column]> ]
    [-starttime <start diff at timestamp>]
    [-endtime <end diff at timestamp>]
    [-maxversions] <max number of versions to diff>
    [-mapreduce] <true|false> (default: true)]
    [-numthreads <numThreads> (default:16, valid only when -mapreduce is
      false)]
      [-cmpmeta <true|false> (default: true)]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   src

   The path to the source table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testsrc under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testsrc
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customersrc under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customersrc

   dst

   The path to the destination table.
     * For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
       mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under a volume
       with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testdst
     * For a table on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customerdst under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   master

   The table that is considered to be the master table. The values are src
   and dst. By default, both the source table and the destination tables
   are considered to be a master.
   first_exit

   By default, the utility compares all the table cells in the specified
   tables. Use this parameter if you want to exit after the first
   difference is identified between the tables. The parameter takes no
   value.
   outdir The path to a directory in which to place the generated sequence
   files. The utility creates the specified directory. If the specified
   directory already exists, the command fails.
   columns By default, the utility compares all columns. If you do not
   want to compare all columns in the table, you can specify specific
   columns to include in the comparison. Provide a comma-separated list of
   column families or columns from a certain column family (column
   family:qualifier). For example, use the following syntax to include the
   column family purchases and the column stars in the reviews column
   family: -columns purchases,reviews:stars
   starttime By default, the utility compares all table values regardless
   of their associated timestamp. You can specify a timestamp to indicate
   the table cell version at which to start the comparison. The timestamp
   is a long integer value that is either user-defined or system-defined
   (epoch in milliseconds). Values with timestamps lower than the
   specified timestamp will not be included in the comparison.
   endtime By default, the utility compares all table values regardless of
   their associated timestamp. Values with timestamps greater than or
   equal to the specified timestamp will not be included in the
   comparison.
   maxversions By default, all versions from the master table are included
   in the comparison. If you do not want to compare all versions, use this
   parameter to specify the number of recent versions to include in the
   comparison.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the comparison. The default, preferred method is to
   use a MapReduce program (true).

   When this parameter is set to false, a client process uses multiple
   threads.
   numthreads When -mapreduce is false, this parameter specifies the
   number of threads allocated to perform the comparison. The default is
   16. If additional CPU resources are available, you might want to
   increase the number of thread to achieve better performance.
   cmpmeta A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to compare table
   metadata such as column families and ACEs. The default is to compare
   metadata (true).

Examples

   The following example compares two MapR-DB tables:
[user@hostname ~]$ hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.DiffTables -src /cust
omerTableA -dst /customerTableB -outdir /customerTableABCompare
2015-03-04 18:04:52,059 INFO  [main] Configuration.deprecation: hadoop.native.li
b is deprecated. Instead, use io.native.lib.available
DiffTablesMeta completed. Metadata of the two tables is same.
...
Mapreduce job completed. The tables mismatch.
NUM_ROWS_MISMATCH_IN_SRC:32; NUM_ROWS_MISMATCH_IN_DST:30. Please check diff in /
customerTableABCompare
