Parameters

   Parameter Description
   name The name (including the path) of the file being
   offloaded/recalled.
   job The ID of the job, which was specified with the offload or recall
   command, to abort. This must be specified to ensure that the correct
   offload or recall task is aborted. If this is not specified, the
   command picks a job to abort in the following order:
    1. Job that is in “already aborting progress” status.
    2. Job that is in “running jobs with latest jobid” status.

   If there are no jobs in progress, the command returns “no active
   transfer in progress” error.
