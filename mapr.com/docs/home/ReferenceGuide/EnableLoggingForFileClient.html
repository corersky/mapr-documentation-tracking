Enabling Runtime Logging

   To enable logging at runtime for the file client (libfsalmapr.so
   library), run the fcdebug utility:
/opt/mapr/server/tools/fcdebug -s <shmid> -m <module> [-l <level>]
/opt/mapr/server/tools/fcdebug -i -s <shmid>

   Before running this command, make a note of the following:
     * If necessary, run maprcli trace info to retrieve the list of
       modules.
       The default value for module is all.
     * Level should be one of FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG.
       If level is not specified, default level is applied for the module.
     * The -i lists the current debug level of all modules.
     * The shmid is available in the fsal.log-* files when libMapRClient
       is loaded.
       For example, the first line in the log file is something similar to
       the following:
2017-02-13 11:56:32,6809 ERROR FuseAPI fs/client/fileclient/cc/fuse_api.cc:1371
Thread: 428 Shmid to be used by fcdebug 512720897
       This shmid can be used with fcdebug.

   Note: Run fcdebug once for every library (every library has a separate
   shared memory). The shmids can be found in the respective fsal log
   files.
