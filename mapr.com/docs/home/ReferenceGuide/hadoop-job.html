   This command will print job details, failed and killed tip details.

   Additional details about the job such as successful tasks and task
   attempts made for each task can be viewed by adding the -all option:
$ hadoop job -history all output-dir

   Blacklisting Tasktrackers

   The hadoop job command when run as root or using sudo can be used to

   prevents additional jobs from being scheduled.
