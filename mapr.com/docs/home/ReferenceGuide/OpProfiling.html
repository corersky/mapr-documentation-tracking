Configuring Profiling for Operations

   To check the amount of time it took to complete each operation (from
   the time of submission), enable profiling for client RPC and MFS
   operations. To enable profiling for:
     * Client RPC, run the following command:
fcdebug -s <shmid> -m ClntProfileRpc -1 DEBUG
       Tip: For more information, see [1]fcdebug.
       Enabling profiling for the client RPC will allow you to determine,
       for each RPC, the amount of time it took to receive a response
       after submitting the request.
     * MFS operations, run the following command:
maprcli trace setlevel -module FSProfile -level debug
       Tip: For more information, see [2]maprcli.
       Enabling profiling for MFS operations will allow you to determine
       the amount of time it took MFS to process each operation.

   By default, profiling is disabled for both client RPC and MFS
   operations. Once enabled, the log for:
     * Client RPC should look similar to the following:

   following command:
