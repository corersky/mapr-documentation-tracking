hadoop distcp

   The hadoop distcp command is a tool used for large inter- and
   intra-cluster copying.

   It uses MapReduce to effect its distribution, error handling and
   recovery, and reporting. It expands a list of files and directories
   into input to map tasks, each of which will copy a partition of the
   files specified in the source list.

Parameters

   Command Options

   The following command options are supported for the hadoop distcp
   command:

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description

   <source>

   Specify the source URL.

   <destination>

   Specify the destination URL.

   -p [rbugp]

   Preserve r: replication number b: block size u: user g: group p:
   permission -p alone is equivalent to -prbugp. Modification times are
   not preserved. When you specify -update, status updates are not
   synchronized unless the file sizes also differ.

   -i

   Ignore failures. As explained in the below, this option will keep more
   accurate statistics about the copy than the default case. It also
   preserves logs from failed copies, which can be valuable for debugging.
   Finally, a failing map will not cause the job to fail before all splits
   are attempted.

   -log <logdir>

   Write logs to <logdir>. The hadoop distcp command keeps logs of each
   file it attempts to copy as map output. If a map fails, the log output
   will not be retained if it is re-executed.

   -m <num_maps>

   Maximum number of simultaneous copies. Specify the number of maps to
   copy data. Note that more maps may not necessarily improve throughput.
   See Map Sizing.

   -overwrite

   Overwrite destination. If a map fails and -i is not specified, all the
   files in the split, not only those that failed, will be recopied. As
   discussed in the Overwriting Files Between Clusters, it also changes
   the semantics for generating destination paths, so users should use
   this carefully.

   -update

   Overwrite if <source> size is different from <destination> size. As
   noted in the preceding, this is not a "sync" operation. The only
   criterion examined is the source and destination file sizes; if they
   differ, the source file replaces the destination file. See Updating
   Files Between Clusters.

   -f <URI list>

   Use list at <URI list> as source list. This is equivalent to listing
   each source on the command line. The value of <URI list> must be a
   fully qualified URI.

   -filelimit <n>

   Limit the total number of files to be <= n. See Symbolic
   Representations.

   -sizelimit <n>

   Limit the total size to be <= n bytes. See Symbolic Representations.

   -delete

   Delete the files existing in the <destination> but not in <source>. The
   deletion is done by FS Shell.

   Generic Options

   The hadoop distcp command supports the following generic options: -conf
   <configuration file>, -D <property=value>, -fs <local|file system URI>,
   -jt <local|jobtracker:port>, -files <file1,file2,file3,...>, -libjars
   <libjar1,libjar2,libjar3,...>, and -archives
   <archive1,archive2,archive3,...>. For more information on generic
   options, see [1]Generic Options.

Symbolic Representations

   The parameter <n> in -filelimit and -sizelimit can be specified with
   symbolic representation. For example,
     * 1230k = 1230 * 1024 = 1259520
     * 891g = 891 * 1024^3 = 956703965184

Map Sizing

   The hadoop distcp command attempts to size each map comparably so that
   each copies roughly the same number of bytes. Note that files are the
   finest level of granularity, so increasing the number of simultaneous
   copiers (i.e. maps) may not always increase the number of simultaneous
   copies nor the overall throughput.

   If -m is not specified, distcp will attempt to schedule work for min
   (total_bytes / bytes.per.map, 20 * num_task_trackers) where
   bytes.per.map defaults to 256MB.

   Tuning the number of maps to the size of the source and destination
   clusters, the size of the copy, and the available bandwidth is
   recommended for long-running and regularly run jobs.

Examples

   For all of the below examples, the cluster name must be specified in
   the [2]mapr-clusters.conf configuration file.

   Basic inter-cluster copying

   The hadoop distcp command is most often used to copy files between
   clusters:
hadoop distcp maprfs://cluster1/foo \
maprfs://cluster2/bar

   The command in the example expands the namespace under /foo/bar on
   cluster1 into a temporary file, partitions its contents among a set of
   map tasks, and starts a copy on each NodeManager node from cluster1 to
   cluster2. Note that the hadoop distcp command expects absolute paths.

   Only those files that do not already exist in the destination are
   copied over from the source directory.

   Updating files between clusters

   Use the hadoop distcp -update command to synchronize changes between
   clusters.
$ hadoop distcp -update maprfs://cluster1/foo maprfs://cluster2/bar/foo

   Files in the /foo subtree are copied from cluster1 to cluster2 only if
   the size of the source file is different from that of the size of the
   destination file. Otherwise, the files are skipped over.

   Note that using the -update option changes distributed copy interprets
   the source and destination paths making it necessary to add the
   trailing /foo subdirectory in the second cluster.

   Overwriting files between clusters

   By default, distributed copy skips files that already exist in the
   destination directory, but you can overwrite those files using the
   -overwrite option. In this example, multiple source directories are
   specified:
$ hadoop distcp -overwrite maprfs://cluster1/foo/a \
maprfs://cluster1/foo/b \
maprfs://cluster2/bar

   As with using the -update option, using the -overwrite changes the way
   that the source and destination paths are interpreted by distributed
   copy: the contents of the source directories are compared to the
   contents of the destination directory. The distributed copy aborts in
   case of a conflict.

   Migrating Data from HDFS to MapR Filesystem

   The hadoop distcp command can be used to migrate data from an HDFS
   cluster to a MapR Filesystem where the HDFS cluster uses the same
   version of the RPC protocol as that used by MapR. For a discussion, see
   [3]Copying Data from Apache Hadoop.
$ hadoop distcp namenode1:50070/foo maprfs:///bar

   You must specify the IP address and HTTP port (usually 50070) for the
   namenode on the HDFS cluster.
