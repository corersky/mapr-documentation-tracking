stream replica edit

   Modifies the way in which messages are replicated from one stream to
   another.

Permissions Required at the Source Cluster

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm permission on the source stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this command unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.

Permissions Required at the Target Cluster

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [4]readAce and [5]writeAce on the volume
     * [6]lookupdir on directories in the path

Syntax

   CLI
maprcli stream replica edit
         -path <stream path>
         -replica <remote stream path>
        [ -newreplica <renamed stream path> ]
        [ -throttle <throttle replication operations under load> ]
        [ -networkencryption <enable on-wire encryption> ]
        [ -synchronous <replicate to remote stream before acknowledging producer
s> ]
        [ -networkcompression <on-wire compression type: off|lz4|lzf|zlib> ]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path The path and name of the stream that you want to create a replica
   for.
   replica The path and name of the stream that you want to create as a
   replica of the stream that you specified with the -path parameter.
   newreplica Specifies a new name to give to the replica stream.
   throttle A boolean value that specifies whether to throttle replication
   operations. Throttle the replication stream to minimize the impact of
   the replication process on incoming operations during periods of heavy
   load. The values are true or false. The default is false.
   Throttling has two effects, both of which allow MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka to use more system resources to process new messages:
     * Throttling slows down the rate at which changes to a stream are
       replicated.
     * Throttling slows down the rate at which messages to be replicated
       are read from disk.

   networkencryption A boolean value that specifies whether or not to
   enable on-wire encryption. The values are true or false. The default is
   false. If you set the value to true, the local cluster and any other
   cluster that is part of the replication process must be enabled for
   security.
   synchronous A boolean value that specifies whether replication is
   synchronous or asynchronous. The values are true or false. The default
   is false and specifies asynchronous replication.
   networkcompression Specifies the type of compression to use when
   replicating messages. For more information, see [7]Managing
   Compression.
