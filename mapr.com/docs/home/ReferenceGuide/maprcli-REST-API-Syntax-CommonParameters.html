   Description

   cluster

   The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is omitted,
   the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.

   zkconnect

   A ZooKeeper connect string, which specifies a list of the hosts running
   ZooKeeper, and the port to use on each, in the format:
   '<host>[:<port>][,<host>[:<port>]...]' Default: 'localhost:5181' In
   most cases the ZooKeeper connect string can be omitted, but it is
   useful in certain cases when the CLDB is not running.
