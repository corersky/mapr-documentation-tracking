Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   path

   The path to the replica.
     * For a path to a table on the local cluster, start the path at the
       volume mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under
       volume1 which has a mount point at /volume1, specify the following
       path: /volume1/testdst

     * For a path to a table on a remote cluster, you must also specify
       the cluster name in the path. For example, for a table named
       customerdst under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the
       following path: /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   upstream

   The path to the source table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testsrc under volume1 which
       has a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testsrc

     * For a path on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customersrc under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customersrc

Example

   Adds company1src as the upstream source for replica company1dst:

   CLI

maprcli table upstream add -path /volume2/company1dst -upstream /volume1/company
1src

  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/upstream/add?path=%2Fvolume2%2Fcompany1dst
