Increasing Log Retention

   To increase log retention for specific component, you can modify the
   configuration file and reset the value of the properties.

Increasing Log Retention for MapR Filesystem

   In the /opt/mapr/conf/mfs.conf file, increase the value for the
   mfs.max.logfile.size.in.mb property. The value for this property is
   computed using the following formula:
maxSizePerLogFile = maxLogSize / MAX_NUM_OF_LOG_FILES

   Here:
     * maxLogSize specifies the total amount of space that MapR Filesystem
       log files can consume.
     * MAX_NUM_OF_LOG_FILES specifies the total number of MapR Filesystem
       log files (5 hard coded).

   For example, for a value of 10 GB, there will be 5 log files (mfs.log-3
   to mfs.log-3.4) of 2GB each.

Increasing Log Retention for CLDB

   In the /opt/mapr/conf/log4j.cldb.properties file, modify the value for
   the following properties:
     * log4j.appender.R.MaxFileSize — specifies the size of each cldb.log
       before rolling over
     * log4j.appender.R.MaxBackupIndex — specifies the number of cldb.log*
       before the oldest one is deleted.

   For example, suppose the following configuration:
     * log4j.appender.R.MaxFileSize = 1024MB
     * log4j.appender.R.MaxBackupIndex = 10

   The CLDB log files will grow to 10GB before they are purged.
   Note: This setting does not impact audit logging.

Increasing Log Retention for Hadoop Services

   You can increase log retention for ResourceManager, NodeManager,
   HistoryServer, and TimelineServer by modifying the following properties
   in the /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-<Version>/etc/hadoop/log4j.properties
   file:
     * hadoop.log.maxfilesize — specifies the size of each
       <service-name>-hostname>.log before rolling over.
     * hadoop.log.maxbackupindex — specifies the number of
       <service-name>-<hostname>.log* before the oldest one is deleted.

   For example, suppose the following configuration:
     * hadoop.log.maxfilesize = 1024Mb
     * hadoop.log.maxbackupindex = 10

   There will be 10 GB of total service-specific logs (1GB per file)
   before the oldest file is purged.
