table cf colperm set

   Sets Access Control Expressions (ACEs) for a specified column.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminaccessperm on the table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path>
  -cfname <column-family name>
  -name <column name>
  [ -appendperm <Access Control Expression for column appends> ]
  [ -readperm <Access Control Expression for column reads> ]
  [ -writeperm <Access Control Expression for column writes> ]
  [ -traverseperm <Access Control Expression for column traversals in JSON table
s> ]

Parameters

   CAPTION:

    Parameter

   Description

   path

   The path to the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under volume1 which has
       a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/test

     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named test under volume1
       in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   cfname

   The name of the column family in which the column is located.
   name For binary tables: The name of the column for which you want to
   set the ACEs.
   For JSON tables: The fieldpath of the field on which you want to set
   permissions. For example, if you wanted to grant readperm to a user on
   field b in the following document. the fieldpath would be a.b.
{
  "a" : {
          "b" : "value_b"
        }
}

   appendperm

   Applies to binary tables only: The Access Control Expression for column
   appends. Use single quotation marks around the ACE.

   Column appends require permission both at the column-family level and
   at the column level.
   readperm

   The Access Control Expression for column reads. Use single quotation
   marks around the ACE.

   Reads require permission both at the column-family level and at the
   column level (for binary tables) or field level (for JSON tables). In
   JSON tables, this permission is inherited by fields within the column
   family.
   writeperm

   The Access Control Expression for column writes (puts and deletes). Use
   single quotation marks around the ACE.

   Writes require permission both at the column-family level and at the
   column level (for binary tables) or field level (for JSON tables). In
   JSON tables, this permission is inherited by fields within the column
   family.
   traverseperm
   Applies to JSON tables only: The Access Control Expressions that
   specifies who has permission to pass over fields in JSON documents. For
   example, suppose that a JSON table contains documents of this general
   structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" : "value",
               "c" : "value"
          }
}

   Suppose further that the user sjohnson has read permission on a.b, but
   not on a. For sjohnson to read a.b, the user needs the traverse
   permission on a. The user can then pass over field a to a.b.

   This permission is inherited by fields within the column family. By
   default, this permission is given to the value of defaulttraverseperm
   for the JSON table.

Example

   Sets readperm ACE for column col1 in table mytable and column family
   cf1 :

   CLI

maprcli table cf colperm set -path /mytable -cfname cf1 -name col1 -readperm 'g:
group1'

   REST

name=col1&readperm="g:group1"' \
  -u mapr:mapr
