          VOLUME_ALARM_DEGRADED_EC_STRIPES

   Meaning
          One of the nodes or SPs, on which either the data or parity
          fragments associated with the tiering enabled volume resides, is
          offline or down.

   Resolution
          MapR tolerates failure of nodes equal to the number of parity
          fragments. However, to ensure the availability of data, add
          nodes to the topology or cluster.
