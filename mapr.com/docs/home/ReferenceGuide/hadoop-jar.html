hadoop jar

   The hadoop jar command runs a program contained in a JAR file. Users
   can bundle their MapReduce code in a JAR file and execute it using this
   command.

Syntax

hadoop jar <jar>
     [<arguments>]

Parameters

   The following commands parameters are supported for hadoop jar:

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description

   <jar>

   The JAR file.

   <arguments>

   Arguments to the program specified in the JAR file.

Examples

   Streaming Application

   Hadoop streaming applications are run using the hadoop jar command. The
   Hadoop streaming utility enables you to create and run MapReduce
   applications with any executable or script as the mapper and/or the
   reducer.
$ hadoop jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar \
    -input myInputDirs \
    -output myOutputDir \
    -mapper org.apache.hadoop.mapred.lib.IdentityMapper \
    -reducer /bin/wc

   The -input, -output, -mapper, and -reducer streaming command options
   are all required for streaming jobs. Either an executable or a Java
   class may be used for the mapper and the reducer. For more information
   about and examples of streaming applications, see [1]Hadoop Streaming
   at the Apache project's page.
   Running from a JAR file

   The simple Word Count program is another example of a program that is
   run using the ï»¿hadoop jar command. The wordcount functionality is built
   into the hadoop-0.20.2-dev-examples.jar program. You pass the file,
   along with the location, to Hadoop with the hadoop jar command and
   Hadoop reads the JAR file and executes the relevant instructions.

   The Word Count program reads files from an input directory, counts the
   words, and writes the results of the application to files in an output
   directory.
$ hadoop jar /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-0.20.2/hadoop-0.20.2-dev-examples.jar wordc
ount /myvolume/in /myvolume/out
