ResourceManager Alarm

   UI Column
          ResourceManager Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_RESOURCEMANAGER_DOWN

   Meaning
          The ResourceManager service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether ResourceManager is running. Warden will try
          three times to restart the service automatically ever 30 minutes
          (by default). This 30 minute interval can be reconfigured using
          the parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec in the
          [2]warden.conf file.

          If warden successfully restarts the ResourceManager, the alarm
          is cleared. If warden is unable to restart the ResourceManager,
          see [3]more troubleshooting information.
