disksetup

   The disksetup command formats specified disks for use by MapR storage
   and adds those disks to the [1]disktab file.

   You do not need to set up RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
   on disks used by MapR-FS. MapR uses disksetup to set up storage pools.
   In most cases, you should let MapR calculate storage pools using the
   default [2]stripe width of two or three disks. If you anticipate a high
   volume of random-access I/O, you can use the -W option to specify
   larger storage pools of up to 8 disks each.

   See [3]Setting Up Disks for MapR for more information about when and
   how to use disksetup.

Syntax

/opt/mapr/server/disksetup
    [-F]
    [-G]
    [-M]
    [-W <stripe_width>]
    <disk list file>

Options

   Option

   Description

   -F

   Forces formatting of all specified disks. Disks that are already
   formatted for MapR are not reformatted by disksetup unless you specify
   this option. The -F option fails when a filesystem has an entry in the
   [4]disktab file, is mounted, or is in use. Call maprcli [5]disk remove
   to remove a disk entry from the disktab file.

   -G

   Generates disktab contents from input disk list, but does not format
   disks. This option is useful if disk names change after a reboot, or if
   the disktab file is damaged.

   -M

   Uses the maximum available number of disks per storage pool.

   -W

   Specifies the number of disks per storage pool.

Examples

   Setting up disks specified in the file /tmp/disks.txt:
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup -F /tmp/disks.txt

   Reformatting all disks

   To reformat all disks, remove the disktab file and issue the disksetup
   -F command to format the disk:
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup -F

   To reformat a particular disk from the disktab use the maprcli disk
   remove and maprcli [6]disk add commands. For more information, see
   [7]Setting Up Disks for MapR.
   Specifying disks

   The [8]disksetup script is used to format disks for use by the MapR
   cluster. Create a text file /tmp/disks.txt listing the disks and
   partitions for use by MapR on the node. Each line lists either a single
   disk or all applicable partitions on a single disk. When listing
   multiple partitions on a line, separate by spaces. For example:
/dev/sdb
/dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdc4
/dev/sdd

   Later, when you run disksetup to format the disks, specify the
   disks.txt file. For example:
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup -F /tmp/disks.txt

   Note:

   The script disksetup removes all data from the specified disks. Make
   sure you specify the disks correctly, and that any data you wish to
   keep has been backed up elsewhere.

   If you are re-using a node that was used previously in another cluster,
   be sure to format the disks to remove any traces of data from the old
   cluster.
   Warning: Run [9]disksetup only after running [10]configure.sh .
   Test Purposes Only: Using a Flat File for Storage

   When setting up a small cluster for evaluation purposes, if a
   particular node does not have physical disks or partitions available to
   dedicate to the cluster, you can use a flat file on an existing disk
   partition as the node's storage. Create at least a 16GB file, and
   include a path to the file in the disk list file for the [11]disksetup
   script.

   The following example creates a 20 GB flat file (bs=1G specifies 1
   gigabyte blocks, multiplied by count=20) at /root/storagefile:
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/storagefile bs=1G count=20

   Then, you would add the following to the disk list file /tmp/disks.txt
   to be used by disksetup:
/root/storagefile
