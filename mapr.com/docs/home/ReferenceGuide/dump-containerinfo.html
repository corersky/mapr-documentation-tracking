dump containerinfo

   Returns detailed information about one or more specified containers.

   A container is a unit of sharded storage in a MapR cluster. Every
   container in a MapR volume is either a name container or a data
   container.

   The name container is the first container in a volume and holds that
   volume's namespace and file chunk locations. Depending on its
   replication role, a name container may be either a master container
   (part of the original copy of the volume) or a replica container (one
   of the replicas in the replication chain).

   Every data container is either a master container, an intermediate
   container, or a tail container.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli dump containerinfo
    [-cluster <cluster name>]
    -ids <id1,id2,id3 ...>

          Note: For best results, use the -json option from the command
          line.

   REST
          N/A

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description
   cluster The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is
   omitted, the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.
   ids Specifies one or more container IDs. Container IDs are comma
   separated. The maprcli dump containers command provides the container
   ID required for -ids parameter.

Output

   The maprcli dump containerinfo command returns information about one or
   more containers.

   Output fields

   CAPTION:

   Field

   Description

   ContainerID

   The unique ID number for the container.

   Epoch

   A sequence number that indicates the most recent copy of the container.
   The CLDB uses the epoch to ensure that an out-of-date copy cannot
   become the master for the container.

   Master

   The physical IP address and port number of the master copy. The master
   copy is part of the original copy of the volume.

   ActiveServers

   The physical IP address and port number of each active node on which
   the container resides.

   InactiveServers

   The physical IP address and port number of each inactive node on which
   the container resides.

   UnusedServers

   The physical IP address and port number of servers from which no
   "heartbeat" has been received for quite some time.

   OwnedSizeMB

   The size on disk (in MB) dedicated to the container.

   SharedSizeMB

   The size on disk (in MB) shared by the container.

   LogicalSizeMB

   The logical size on disk (in MB) of the container.

   TotalSizeMB

   The total size on disk (in MB) allocated to the container. Combines the
   Owned Size and Shared Size.

   Mtime

   The time of the last modification to the contents of the container.

   NameContainer

   Indicates if the container is the name container for the volume. If
   true, the container holds the volume's namespace information and file
   chunk locations.

   VolumeName

   The name of the volume.

   VolumeId

   The unique ID number of the volume.

   VolumeReplication

   The replication factor, the number of copies of a volume excluding the
   original.

   VolumeMounted

   Indicates whether the volume is mounted. If true, the volume is
   currently mounted. If false, the volume is not mounted.

Example

   CLI

maprcli dump containerinfo -ids 2049 -json
