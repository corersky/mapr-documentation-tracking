gfsck

   The gfsck (global filesystem check) command performs a check and repair
   operation on a volume or volume snapshot. The command checks the
   consistency of a volume including:
     * All cross container links (for example, from file to filelets, from
       table to tablets)
     * The tabletmap key range
     * The attributes of filelets (uid/gid/mode)

   It identifies the unreachable files, directories, and tables in the
   volume and moves them to /lost+found during repair operation. It also
   identifies any unreachable DB inodes or dangling pointers to lost
   inodes and fixes them.

   The gfsck utility can be used when local fsck repairs some containers
   at highest epoch or when some containers are lost (either when a lower
   epoch container was promoted as master or when a container was
   permanently lost) at highest epoch.

Permissions Required

   You will need root user permissions to run gfsck. However, commands for
   checking tiering-enabled volumes can only be run by the mapr user.

Typical process flow

    1. Take the affected storage pools offline with the [1]mrconfig sp
       offline command.
    2. Execute the [2]fsck command on the storage pools (or disks).
    3. Bring the storage pools back online with the [3]mrconfig sp online
       command.
    4. Execute the gfsck command on the cluster, volumes, or snapshots
       that were affected.
       Warning: If there are alarms, such as DataUnavailableAlarm or
       DataUnderReplicatedAlarm, do not run gfsck command with -r
       (--repair) option. Running the gfsck command with the -r (--repair)
       option might result in data loss. If necessary, first run gfsck
       without the -r (--repair) option and attempt to repair only after
       analyzing the command output.

Syntax

/opt/mapr/bin/gfsck
    [ -h|--help ]
    [ -c|--clear ]
    [ -d|--debug ]
    [ -b|--dbcheck ]
    [ -r|--repair ]
    [ -y|--assume-yes ]
    [ -Gquick|--check-gateway-consistency-only ]
    [ -Gfull|--check-gateway-vcd-consistency ]
    [ -Dquick|--check-object-presence ]

    [ cluster=<cluster name> ]

    [ snapshot=<snapshot name> ]
    [ snapshotid=<snapshot-id> ]

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description
   -b|--dbcheck Checks that every key in a tablet is within that tablet's
   startKey and endKey range. This option is very IO intensive, and should
   only be used if database inconsistency is suspected.
   -c|--clear Clears previous warnings before performing the global
   filesystem check.
   -d|--debug Provides additional information in the output for debug
   purposes.
   -Gquick|--check-gateway-consistency-only Can be run as mapr user only.
   Checks if the entries in the metadata tables maintained internally (for
   objects and tiers) are consistent. If inconsistent, reports the error.
   -Gfull|--check-gateway-vcd-consistency Can be run as mapr user only.
   Checks if the entries in the metadata tables maintained internally (for
   objects and containers) are consistent. If inconsistent, reports the
   error.
   -Dquick|--check-object-presence Can be run as mapr user only. This must
   be specified with either -Gquick or -Gfull. Checks if the object in the
   metadata tables exists in the tier or not. If inconsistent, reports the
   error.
   -GdelLog|--delete-Gateway-Log Can be run as mapr user only. Deletes the
   metalog created by MAST Gateway when it crashes.
   -h|--help Prints usage text.
   -r --repair Indicates that repairs should be performed if needed.
   Note: Running the gfsck command with the -r (--repair) option might
   result in data loss. If necessary, first run gfsck without the -r
   (--repair) option and attempt to repair only after analyzing the
   command output.
   -y --assume-yes Assumes that containers without valid copies (as
   reported by CLDB) can be deleted automatically. If this option is not
   specified, gfsck will pause for user input to verify that containers
   can be deleted - enter yes to delete, no to exit gfsck, or ctrl-C to
   quit.
   cluster Name of the cluster (default: default cluster)
   rwvolume Name of the volume (default: null)
   snapshot Name of the snapshot (default: null)
   snapshotid The snapshot id (default: 0)

Example (Debug mode)

   Execute the gfsck command on the read/write volume named
   mapr.cluster.root with debug mode turned on.
/opt/mapr/bin/gfsck rwvolume=mapr.cluster.root -d
