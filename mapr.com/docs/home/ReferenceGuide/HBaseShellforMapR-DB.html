MapR-DB HBase Shell (Binary Tables)

   You can manage MapR-DB tables using HBase shell commands and additional
   HBase shell commands included in the MapR distribution of Hadoop.

   The HBase shell command is used on binary tables only. To run this
   command, execute the following:
hbase shell

   Note: Before running the shell, ensure that your user ID has both the
   readAce and writeAce permissions on the volume. For information about
   these permissions, see [1]Managing Whole Volume ACEs.

   When you specify a table in HBase shell, use the following syntax:
     * For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
       mount point. For example, for a table named test under a volume
       with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path as the
       table name: “/volume1/test”
     * For a table on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path as
       the table name: “/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer”

   Note: You can access a table on a remote cluster when the remote
   cluster has an entry in the [2]mapr-clusters.conf file on the node
   where the HBase shell is running.

   The following table lists the supported HBase shell commands that you
   can use to manage MapR-DB tables:
   Command Description
   alter Performs the following actions on MapR-DB tables:
     * Adds a new table or column family
     * Modifies the following table-level attributes:
     *
          + BULKLOAD - A Boolean value that specifies whether to perform a
            full bulk load of the table. The default is false. For more
            information, see [3]Bulk Loading and MapR-DB Tables.
          + MAX_FILESIZE
          + AUTOSPLIT - A Boolean value that specifies whether to split
            the table into regions automatically as the table grows. The
            average size of each region is determined by the regionsizemb
            parameter. The default value is true. If you set the value to
            false, you can manually split tables into regions by using the
            maprcli table region split command.
     * Modifies the following attributes of a column family:
     *
          + TTL
          + VERSIONS (max or min)
          + COMPRESSION
          + IN_MEMORY

   Aside from the attributes listed above, no other attributes apply to
   MapR-DB tables. Unlike HBase, you do not need to disable a table before
   altering a table.
   alter_async On MapR-DB tables, this has the same behavior as the alter
   command.
   count Counts the number of rows in a specified table.
   create Creates a table in the specified path.
   delete Deletes a value in a specified table, row, and column.
   Optionally, you can also specify the timestamp associated with the
   value that you want to delete.
   deleteall Delete all values in a row based on the table name and row.
   Optionally, you can also specify the timestamp associated with the
   values that you want to delete.
   describe Describes a specified table.
   disable Marks a specified table as disabled. This state is recorded
   only in the client process (HBase shell) memory and does not actually
   disable any operations on a MapR-DB table.
   disable_all Marks tables as disabled if they have names matching the
   specified regular expression. This state is recorded only in the client
   process (HBase shell) memory and does not actually disable any
   operations on the MapR-DB tables.
   drop Drops a specified table that is marked as disabled.
   drop_all Drops all tables that are marked as disabled.
   enable Marks a specified table as enabled. This state is recorded only
   in the client process (HBase shell) memory.
   enable_all Marks tables as enabled if they have a table name that
   matches the specified regular expression. This state is recorded only
   in the client process (HBase shell) memory.
   exists Returns boolean value true if the specified table exists.
   exit Exits the HBase shell.
   get Gets the contents of a row or cell.
   get_counter Returns the value of a counter at a specified table, row,
   and column.
   incr Increments a value at a specified table, row, and column.
   is_disabled Returns a value that indicates if a specified table is
   disabled. You can perform operations on MapR-DB tables that are
   disabled.
   is_enabled Returns a value that indicates if a specified table is
   enabled. You can perform operations on MapR-DB tables even if they are
   not enabled.
   list For HBase 1.1 or above, if the mapr.hbase.default.db property is
   set to maprdb, this command returns the MapR-DB tables under the user's
   home directory.
   list_perm Lists all permissions set by Access Control Expressions for a
   specified table. This HBase shell command only operates on MapR-DB
   tables. For more information, see [4]list_perm.
   put Puts a value at a specified table, row, and column. Optionally, you
   can also specify the timestamp for that value.
   scan Scans a specified table. Optionally, you can also specify a
   dictionary of scanner specifications.
   set_perm Sets permissions with Access Control Expressions on a
   specified table, column family, or column qualifier. This Hbase shell
   command only operates on MapR-DB tables. For more information, see
   [5]set_perm.
   show_filters Shows all the filters supported by the Hbase or MapR-DB
   tables. Provide the link to 4.1 supported filters doc
   truncate Disables, drops, and recreates a specified table.
   version Returns the HBase client version.
   whoami Returns the current user.

   MapR-DB does not support the following HBase shell commands:
     * add_peer
     * alter_status
     * assign
     * balance_switch
     * balancer
     * close_region
     * compact
     * disable_peer
     * enable_peer
     * flush
     * grant
     * hlog_roll
     * list_peer
     * major_compact
     * move
     * remove_peer
     * start_replication
     * stop_replication
     * status
     * split
     * revoke
     * unassign
     * user_permission
     * zk_dump

   For more information about the HBase shell commands, see the [6]Apache
   HBase documentation.
