warden.<servicename>.conf

   The warden.conf configuration file is associated with standard services
   provided by MapR. Warden supports service monitoring for additional
   services.

   Each of these supported services requires a configuration file,
   warden.<servicename>.conf, which is included with the package for that
   service. When you install one of these service packages, its
   corresponding configuration file is stored in /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d.
   The configuration files and their packages are shown below:

   sentry warden.sentry.conf Installed with the mapr-sentry package,
   however Sentry is not automatically monitored by the Warden. When
   Sentry is configured to use the database storage model, you can
   manually copy the
   /opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<version>/conf.d/warden.sentry.conf file to the
   /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d directory to add Sentry to the list of services
   that the Warden monitors.
   spark master warden.spark-master.conf Installed with the spark-master
   package.

   The following properties can be in a warden.<servicename>.conf file:

   CAPTION:

   Property Name Description
   services Service name and number of nodes this service should run on,
   along with service dependencies. Format is
   serviceName:N[depServiceName].Values for N = 1 or all.
   service.displayname Service display name to appear in UI
   service.command.start Service start command
   service.command.stop Service stop command
   service.command.type Indicates whether the script runs in background
   (and exits) or inline (script does not exit). Type is BACKGROUND or
   INLINE.
   service.command.monitor Monitors string (if the service monitor command
   does not provide sufficient monitoring)
   service.command.monitorcommand Specifies a command that checks whether
   the service is running
   service.port Port where the service is running (for example, hue
   webserver runs on port 8888)
   service.uri

   To include a link to a user interface associated with this service in
   the MCS, enter a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in this property and
   also specify the port in the service.ui.port property. For example,
   enter /service1 for this property and then enter 8080 in the
   service.ui.port property to provide the following UI link for this
   service in the MCS: http://<hostname>:8080/service1
   service.ui.port If you want to include a link to the user interface
   associated with this service in the MCS, enter the port in this
   property and also specify the URI in the service.uri property.
   service.logs.location Location of the service log files
   service.depends.local Indicates whether service depends on a service
   instance locally, or on the master. Values = 1 (local) or 0 (master).

   service.alarm.tersename
   Specifies the abbreviated alarm name for this service. This is the
   alarm name that appears in the MCS. Once the service has been started
   by Warden, you cannot edit this value.
   service.alarm.label Specifies the alarm name for this service. This is
   the alarm name that appears in the maprcli when you do not request a
   terse output. Once the service has been started by Warden, you cannot
   edit this value.
   service.heapsize.percent Specifies heapsize percent.
   service.heapsize.max Maximum heapsize in MB.
   service.heapsize.min Minimum heapsize in MB.
   service.env Specifies environment variables to be use by the service.
   By default, it may include MAPR_MAPREDUCE_MODE=default. You can include
   a comma-separated list of environment variables. For example,
   service.env=MAPR_MAPREDUCE_MODE=default,ABC=1,XYZ=2

Memory Management for Services

   The following memory parameters are used to reserve memory for the
   service:
     * The service.<servicename>.heapsize.percent parameter controls the
       percentage of system memory allocated to the named service.
     * The service.<servicename>.heapsize.max parameter defines the
       maximum heapsize used when invoking the service.
     * The service.<servicename>.heapsize.min parameter defines the
       minimum heapsize used when invoking the service.

   For example, the service.command.gateway.heapsize.percent,
   service.command.gateway.heapsize.max, and
   service.command.gateway.heapsize.min parameters in the
   warden.gateway.conf file controls the amount of memory that Warden
   allocates to the gateway service before allocating memory to other
   services.

   The actual heap size used when invoking a service is a combination of
   the three parameters according to the formula max(heapsize.min,
   min(heapsize.max, total-memory * heapsize.percent / 100)).

warden.hs2.conf Example

   The hiveserver2 configuration file, warden.hs2.conf, looks like this:
services=hs2:1
service.displayname=HiveServer2
service.command.start=/opt/mapr/hive/hive-0.13/bin/hive --start --service hivese
rver2
service.command.stop=/opt/mapr/hive/hive-0.13/bin/hive --stop --service hiveserv
er2
service.command.type=BACKGROUND
service.command.monitorcommand=/opt/mapr/hive/hive-0.13/bin/hive --status --serv
ice hiveserver2
service.port=9083
service.ui.port=9083
service.uri=about
service.logs.location=/tmp/mapr
service.process.type=JAVA

   When hiveserver2 is installed, the warden.hs2.conf file is placed in
   the directory /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d. If Warden is running, it will
   detect the file and start the service. If Warden is not running, the
   file is picked up when Warden starts. Warden monitors the service and
   displays the status on the MapR Control System UI.

   The service.process.type parameter indicates that the hiveserver2
   process is a Java process.
