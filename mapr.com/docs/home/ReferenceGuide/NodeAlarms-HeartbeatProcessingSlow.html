Heartbeat Processing Slow

   UI Column
          Heartbeat Processing Slow Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_HB_PROCESSING_SLOW

   Meaning
          The time that has elapsed since the CLDB processed the previous
          heartbeat from the MapR Filesystem node has exceeded 5 seconds.

   Resolution
          When the CLDB is processing a heartbeat from a node, it will
          compare the current time to the time at which the previous
          heartbeat from that node was processed. If the elapsed time
          exceeds 5 seconds then this alarm is raised. If this alarm
          occurs frequently, investigate what might be causing the
          relevant node or nodes to be busy, or whether the CLDB nodes
          have enough resources to handle their load.
