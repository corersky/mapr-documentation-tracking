fsck

   Filesystem check (fsck) is used to find and fix inconsistencies in the
   filesystem.

   Every storage pool has its own log to journal updates to the storage
   pool. All operations to a storage pool are done transactionally by
   journaling all operations to the log before they are applied to storage
   pool metadata. If MFS is not shutdown cleanly, some metadata blocks may
   not persist. However, on the next load of the storage pool, log
   recovery takes care of these metadata blocks by replaying the records
   in the log. The fsck utility also replays the log before it checks the
   metadata consistency in a storage pool. The fsck utility walks the
   storage pool in question to verify all MapR-FS metadata (and data
   correctness if specified on the command line), and reports all
   potentially lost or corrupt containers, directories, tables, files,
   filelets, and blocks in the storage pool. The fsck utility:
     * Checks whether all files and directories are reachable and all
       directory entries are valid.
     * Checks BTrees are consistent for various inode types (such as files
       and directories).
     * Walks the container file and visits every inode in the container to
       check that no block is owned by two inodes and verifies the
       consistency of bitmaps of inodes and blocks.
     * Checks consistency of snapshots.
     * Visits every allocated block in the storage pool and recovers any
       blocks that are part of a corrupted inodes.
     * Checks consistency of MapR-DB metadata.
     * Checks consistency of tabletmap, tablets, buckets, and spill files.

   The fsck utility can be used on an offline storage pool after a node
   failure, after a disk failure, or after a MapR-FS process crash, or
   simply to verify the consistency of data for suspected software bugs.

Typical process flow:

     * Take the affected storage pools offline with the [1]mrconfig sp
       offline command.

     * Execute the fsck command on the storage pools (or disks) as
       discussed below.

     * Bring the storage pools back online with the [2]mrconfig sp online
       command.

     * Execute the [3]gfsck command on the cluster, volumes, or snapshots
       that were affected.

   The local fsck command can be run in two modes:
     * Verification mode - fsck only reports errors; it does not attempt
       to fix or modify any data on disk. fsck can be run in verification
       mode on an offline storage pool at any time, and it will report
       errors if there is inconsistency. If it does not report any errors,
       the storage pool can be brought online without any risk of data
       loss. To run the fsck utility in verification mode, use any
       parameter except the -r parameter.

     * Repair mode - fsck attempts to restore a bad storage pool. If the
       local fsck is run in repair mode on a storage pool, some volumes
       might need a global fsck (gfsck) after bringing the storage pool
       online. There is potential for loss of data in this case. To run
       the fsck utility in repair mode, use the -r parameter.

   Using the /opt/mapr/server/fsck utility with the -r option produces
   different results depending on the scenario. The fsck utility does not
   interpret the scenario nor does it have a safe mode.
     * If a disk is offline because of an imbalanced b-tree, using fsck -r
       may result in data loss from bad containers and data loss if
       additional replicas are unavailable.
     * If a disk is offline because of an I/O error, using fsck -r
       produces indeterminate results. A disk that is throwing I/O errors
       is questionable in terms of data content and reliability. For
       example, an operation that completed on the disk but was never
       returned may have partial data remaining on the disk. Using fsck -r
       retains any partial data.
     * If a disk is offline because of a slow I/O, using fsck -r does not
       produce data loss.

   The most conservative usage of fsck is to first run fsck without the -r
   option (verification mode) and check the output. If the output returns
   errors, then run fsck with the -r option.

Syntax

/opt/mapr/server/fsck
    [ -b ]
    [ -C <cid> ]
    [ -d ]
    [ <device-paths> | -n <sp name> ]
    [ -h ]
    [ -I <inum> ]
    [ -j ]
    [ -l <log filename> ]
    [ -m <memory in MB> ]
    [ -N ]
    [ -p <MapR-FS port> ]
    [ -P ]
    [ -r ]

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description
   -b Checks database consistency.
   -C Optional with the -d option. Specifies the read-write container ID
   on which CRC (cyclic redundancy check) must be performed. If this
   option is not specified with the -d option, the CRC is performed on all
   the containers on the storage pool.

   -d

   Performs a CRC on data blocks. By default, fsck will not validate the
   CRC of user data pages. Enabling this check can take quite a long time
   to finish.

   <device-paths>

   Paths to the disks that make up the storage pool.
   Note: Before running fsck, remove all the disks from MFS using mrconfig
   disk remove command. For example:
/opt/mapr/server/mrconfig disk remove /dev/sdb
/opt/mapr/server/fsck /dev/sdb

   -h

   Help

   -I

   Optional with the -C option. Specifies the inode number on which CRC
   (cyclic redundancy check) must be performed in the container specified
   by -C option. If this option is not specified with the -C option, the
   CRC is performed on all the inodes.

   -j

   Skips log replay. Should be set only when log recovery fails. Log
   recovery can fail if the damaged blocks of a disk belong to the log, or
   if log recovery finds some CRC errors in the metadata blocks. *Using
   this parameter will typically lead to larger data loss. *

   -l

   The log filename. Default: /tmp/fsck.<pid>.out

   -m

   Sets the cache size for blocks (MB).

   -n

   Storage pool name. This option works only if all the disks are in
   disktab. Otherwise the user will have to individually specify all the
   disks that make up the storage pool, using the <device-paths>
   parameter.
   -N Disables the status bar.

   -p

   The MapR-FS port. Default: 5660
   -P Purges deleted containers in repair.

   -r

   Runs in repair mode. USE WITH CAUTION AS THIS CAN LEAD TO LOSS OF DATA.
