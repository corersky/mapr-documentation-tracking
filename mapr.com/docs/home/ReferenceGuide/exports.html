exports

Access control for hosts

   On each node, the file /opt/mapr/conf/exports lists the clusters and
   mount points available to mount with NFS.

   Specify access control for hosts with a space-separated list of hosts,
   appending (rw) for read-write or (ro) for read-only access after each
   host. To specify a default access for all hosts not otherwise
   specified, add (rw) or (ro) after a space at the end of a line. The
   exports file follows the same semantics as a standard UNIX exports
   table. The following export options are supported:
   Export option Definition
   ro Provides read-only access.
   rw Provides read-write access.
   root_squash

   Squashes root privileges for remote users.

   For example, you can use:
/mapr (rw,root_squash)

   This entry prevents the /mapr directory from being written to by the
   root user on remote hosts.
   no_root_squash Turns off root squashing for remote users.
   all_squash Squashes every remote user, including root.
   anonuid, anongid Specifies user and group IDs to use with remote users
   from a particular host.

Restricting clusters to specific hosts

   To restrict access to a specific export path to particular hosts, use
   the following format:
<Path> <space-separated list of hosts and access rights>

   For example, the line /mapr/cluster1 host01(rw) host02(ro) restricts
   read-write access to the cluster in /mapr/cluster1 to host host01, and
   restricts read-only access to host host02. No other hosts have access.
   Note: After making changes to this file, you do not have to restart the
   NFS server. You can run a maprcli command to refresh the exports
   definition without a restart. See [1]nfsmgmt refresh exports.

Enabling Central Configuration

   To enable [2]Central Configuration for exports, specify a value for the
   AutoRefreshExportsTimeInterval parameter in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/nfsserver.conf file. The value of the
   AutoRefreshExportsTimeInterval parameter determines the number of
   minutes after which the NFS server refreshes the exports file. The
   default value of 0 disables central configuration for NFS exports.

Sample exports file

# Sample Exports file

# for /mapr exports
# <Path> <exports_control>

#access_control -> order is specific to default
# list the hosts before specifying a default for all
#  host01(ro) host02(ro) host03(ro) (rw)
#  enforces ro for a.b.c.d & 1.2.3.4 and everybody else is rw

# special path to export clusters in mapr-clusters.conf. To disable exporting,
# comment it out. to restrict access use the exports_control
#
/mapr (rw)

#to export only certain clusters, comment out the /mapr & uncomment.
# Note: this will cause /mapr to be unexported
#/mapr/clustername (rw)

#to export /mapr only to certain hosts (using exports_control)
#/mapr a.b.c.d(rw) e.f.g.h(ro)

# export /mapr/cluster1 rw to a.b.c.d & ro to e.f.g.h (denied for others)
#/mapr/cluster1 a.b.c.d(rw) e.f.g.h(ro)

# export /mapr/cluster2 only to e.f.g.h (denied for others)
#/mapr/cluster2 e.f.g.h(rw)

# export /mapr/cluster3 rw to e.f.g.h & ro to others
#/mapr/cluster2 e.f.g.h(rw) (ro)
