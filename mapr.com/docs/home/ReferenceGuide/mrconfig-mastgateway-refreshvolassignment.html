mastgateway refreshvolassignment

   Triggers CLDB to re-assign specified volume to the least utilized MAST
   Gateway to rebalance tiering operations.

   This can be used when new MAST Gateways are added or when MAST Gateways
   are removed from the cluster.
   Note: You must run this command once for each volume to reassign. Run
   this command for all volumes if MAST Gateway is either newly added to
   the cluster or permanently removed from the cluster.

Syntax

mrconfig mastgateway refreshvolassignment <volname>

Parameters

   Parameter             Description
   volname   The name of the volume to reassign.

Result

   If the volume is successfully re-assigned, a success message (similar
   to the one shown in the [1]Examples below) is printed on the console
   where the command was triggered.

   In case of an error, the volume might or might not be assigned to the
   newly added MAST Gateway. However, the volume would either continue to
   be assigned to the same MAST Gateway or would be assigned to a
   different gateway. You can re-run the command in case of a failure.

Examples

   Refresh the assignment of the containers associated with volume named
   vold23:
# /opt/mapr/server/mrconfig mastgateway refreshvolassignment vold23
volume assignment refreshed successfully.
