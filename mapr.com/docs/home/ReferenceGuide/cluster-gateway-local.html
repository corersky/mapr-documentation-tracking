cluster gateway local

   Lists the gateways that are configured on the MapR cluster where this
   command is run.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway local
    [ -format dns|text ]
    [ -cluster <cluster on which command to be run> ]

   REST

http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/cluster/gateway/local

Parameters

   Parameter                           Description
   format The output format. Value types: dns or text. Default: text.
   Note:
     * If the output is formatted as DNS, you can copy and paste the
       output into a DNS record in the zone file for your domain. The
       source MapR cluster can then locate the gateways by doing a DNS
       lookup.
     * If the output is formatted as text, you can copy and paste that
       text into the -gateways parameter of the maprcli cluster gateway
       set command. Running this command is an alternative way of
       specifying the location of these gateways to the source MapR
       cluster.

   cluster If you are not on a MapR cluster where one or more gateways are
   configured, provide the name of the cluster.
     * When replicating MapR Database table data to one or more replicas
       on this cluster, then the cluster is a destination MapR cluster.
     * When indexing MapR Database table data in one or more Elasticsearch
       cluster, then the current cluster is a source MapR cluster where
       the tables being indexed are located.
