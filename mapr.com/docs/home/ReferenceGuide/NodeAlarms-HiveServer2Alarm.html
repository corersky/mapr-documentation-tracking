HiveServer 2 Alarm

   UI Column
          HiveServer 2 Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_HS2_DOWN

   Meaning
          The HiveServer 2 service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether HiveServer 2 is running. Warden will try three
          times to restart the service automatically ever 30 minutes (by
          default). This 30 minute interval can be reconfigured using the
          parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec in the [2]warden.conf
          file.

          If Warden successfully restarts the HiveServer 2 service, the
          alarm is cleared. If Warden is unable to restart the HiveServer
          2 service, contact MapR technical support.
