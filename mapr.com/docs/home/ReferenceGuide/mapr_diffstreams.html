mapr diffstreams

   This utility compares the message IDs, metadata, and data in two MapR
   streams. Then, generates two directories that contain sequence files
   that you can use to merge the rows from the two MapR streams.

   Sequence files are binary flat files. You can learn more about them
   [1]here. To convert a sequence file into a format that you can read,
   use the [2]MapR-DB JSON FormatResult utility.

   This utility considers both the source stream and the destination
   stream to be a master stream. Therefore, it generates two directories
   with sequence files. These sequence files contain the puts required to
   update each stream so that it contains a superset of the rows defined
   in both tables at the time at which the utility was run.
   This utility generates both of the following output directories in the
   output directory that you specify:

   opsForDst
          A directory containing sequence files that correspond to each
          put and delete required to make the destination stream identical
          to the source stream.

   opsForSrc
          A directory containing sequence files that correspond to each
          put and delete required to make the source stream identical to
          the destination stream.

Required Permissions

   To use this utility, you must have the following permissions:
     * The permission readAce on the volumes where the tables are located.
     * On the source stream: either consumeperm or copyperm.
     * On the destination stream: either consumeperm or copyperm.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [3]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on streams, see
   [4]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

mapr diffstreams
-src <srcStream>
-dst <dstStream>
-outdir <output directory>
[-first_exit] Exit when first difference is found
[-mapreduce true/false default:false]
[-numthreads <nthreads> default:16]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   src The path of the first stream to include in the comparison.
   dst The path of the second stream to include in the comparison.
   outdir The path to a directory in which to place the generated sequence
   files. The utility creates the specified directory. If the specified
   directory already exists, the command fails.
   first_exit

   By default, the utility compares all the data in the specified streams.
   Use this parameter if you want to exit after the first difference is
   identified between the streams. The parameter takes no value.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the comparison. The default, preferred method is to
   use a MapReduce program (true).

   When this parameter is set to false, a client process uses multiple
   threads.

   The MapReduce program runs as a MapReduce version 2 application based
   on the MapReduce mode that is configured on this node.
   numthreads When -mapreduce is false, this parameter specifies the
   number of threads allocated to perform the comparison. The default is
   16. If additional CPU resources are available, you might want to
   increase the number of thread to achieve better performance.
