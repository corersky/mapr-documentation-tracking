Parameters

   Parameter

   Description
   advisoryquota The advisory quota for the volume as integer plus unit.
   Example: quota=500G; Units: B, K, M, G, T, P
   ae The accounting entity that owns the volume.
   aetype The type of accounting entity:
     * 0=user
     * 1=group

   allowgrant Specifies whether the volume as a parent grants permission
   for a child volume to inherit its properties. True or false. Default:
   false.
   auditenabled Specifies whether to turn auditing on for the volume. If
   auditing is also enabled at the cluster level with the [1]maprcli audit
   data command, setting this value to true causes auditing to start for
   any directories, files, tables, or streams that are already enabled for
   auditing. If none are yet so enabled, enabling auditing on any of them
   causes auditing of them to start.

   Set auditenabled to true to enable auditing on directories, files,
   tables, and streams in the volume.
   You must have the fc permission on the cluster to use this parameter.
   See [2]acl for details about this permission.
   autooffloadthresholdgb The size of the volume in GB (threshold). When
   this threshold is reached or exceeded, volume data is automatically
   offloaded by the Automatic Tiering Scheduler. To use the global size
   threshold (of 1024 GB), set the value for this to 0, which is the
   default value.
   cluster The cluster on which to run the command.
   coalesce The interval of time during which READ, WRITE, or GETATTR
   operations on one file from one client IP address are logged only once,
   if auditing is enabled.

   For example, suppose that a client application reads a single file
   three times in 6 minutes, so that there is one read at 0 minutes,
   another at 3 minutes, and a final read at 6 minutes. If the coalesce
   interval is at least 6 minutes, then only the first read operation is
   logged. However, if the interval is between 4 minutes, then only the
   first and third read operations are logged. If the interval is 2
   minutes, all three read operations are logged.

   The default value is 60 minutes. Setting this field to a larger number
   helps prevent audit logs from growing quickly.
   compactionoverheadthreshold Specifies the percentage of offloaded data
   that must have been deleted on the MapR cluster to qualify the data for
   compaction (or deletion from the tier). The default value is 30%.
   compactionschedule Specifies the schedule to use for running the
   compactor. By default, the compactor runs on an automatic internal
   schedule.
   containerallocationfactor Specifies the number of containers to create
   when the first write from a remote client is sent to the volume. The
   pre-created containers are distributed equally across topologies,
   servers, MapR Filesystem instances, SPs, and CLDB also takes into
   consideration the load (IO/Space) when selecting target SPs for
   containers. Value must be a positive integer. The default value is 0.
   Value can be up to twice the number of SPs in the volume’s topology.
   criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec Timeout (in seconds) before
   re-replicating critically under-replicated containers only. If both
   rereplicationtimeoutsec and criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec are set and
   if the value of:
     * rereplicationtimeoutsec is less than
       criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec, rereplicationtimeoutsec will
       override criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec setting for both
       under-replicated and critically under-replicated containers.
     * rereplicationtimeoutsec is greater than
       criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec, criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec
       will override rereplicationtimeoutsec setting for critically
       under-replicated containers only; rereplicationtimeoutsec setting
       is still applicable for under-replicated containers.

   Default value for this parameter is 0 (which indicates no timeout).
   Value can be 0, or >= 300 seconds and <= 3600 seconds.
   dataauditops The comma separated list of filesystem operations to
   include (specified with a preceding plus sign (+)) or exclude
   (specified with a preceding minus sign (-)) from auditing.

   If the first operation in the list (of operations) is to be excluded
   from auditing, it must be preceded by two minus (--) signs. Subsequent
   operations to exclude must be preceded by only a single minus (-) sign,
   whether or not the first operation was included (using a plus (+) sign)
   or excluded (using two minus (--) signs). If neither sign is specified,
   the given operation is included for auditing.
   The operations that can be included (+) or excluded (-) from auditing
   are listed [3]here. You can, alternatively, group all the operations
   using the keyword all, which:
     * If included (+), cannot be specified with a list of other included
       operations.
     * If excluded (-), cannot be specified with a list of other excluded
       operations.

   You can specify a mixed list of included and excluded operations. There
   is no change to operations that are not specified with the command.
   Tip: For more information, see [4]Selective Auditing of Filesystem and
   Table Operations.
   dbindexlagsecalarmthresh Specifies the threshold (in seconds) to raise
   an alarm for index update lag. Default: 0
   dbrepllagsecalarmthresh Specifies the threshold (in seconds) to raise
   an alarm for DB replication lag. Default: 0
   ecenable Enable (true) warm tiering for the volume only if it is
   already not enabled. If this is specified, you cannot specify tiername
   to use an existing warm-tier; when the command runs, a new tier is
   created for the volume.

   You cannot enable warm tiering if it was disabled, or disable warm
   tiering if it was enabled, when the volume was being created.
   ecscheme The number of data chunks and the number of parity chunks
   separated by a plus (+) sign. The default scheme is 4+2. For
   information on the supported schemes, see [5]Erasure Coding Scheme for
   Data Protection and Recovery.
   ectopology The topology of the erasure coded volume if it is already
   not set. You cannot change the topology of an erasure coded volume
   using this command. To change the topology of an erasure coded volume,
   use [6]volume move.
   enforceminreplicationforio Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to
   enforce minimum number of replicas for the (read-write) volume during
   IO. This flag ensures that further updates (writes) to volume are
   successful only when the minimum number of copies of the container is
   available. Setting this to true ensures that if writes succeed, then it
   has been applied to at least the minimum number of copies and if writes
   fail, it may have been applied to zero or more copies.

   Enabling this parameter, may stall volume dump and volume snapshot
   create operations, if the minimum number of copies of the container are
   not available.
   If this parameter was not set on a volume, or if this parameter is
   modified from false to true, restart all the nodes where the containers
   associated with the volume exist for the changes to take effect.

   This flag, if set on Mirror Volumes, is ignored.
   forceauditenable Specifies whether (1) or not (0) to force audit of
   operations on all files, tables, and streams in the volume if auditing
   is enabled at the cluster level and at the volume level, irrespective
   of the audit setting on the individual directory, file, table, and
   stream. Value can be:
     * true — force audit of all content
     * false — do not force audit

   By default, this is disabled (0). To force audit of all directories,
   files, tables, and streams in the volume irrespective of the audit
   setting on the directories, files, tables, and streams, the
   auditenabled parameter value must also be set to true.
   group Space-separated list of group:permission pairs.
   maxinodesalarmthreshold The number of inodes, which when exceeded
   raises the [7]INODES_EXCEEDED alarm.
   maxnssizembalarmthreshold The namespace container size, which when
   exceeded raises the [8]INODES_EXCEEDED alarm.
   metricsenabled Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to enable
   metrics collection for a volume.
   minreplication The minimum replication level. Default: 0
   Tip: For more information, see [9]Understanding Replication.
   mirrorschedule The schedule ID corresponding to the schedule to be used
   for mirroring. Pre-assigned IDs include 1 for critical data, 2 for
   important data, and 3 for normal data. Custom schedules are assigned ID
   numbers in sequence. To determine the ID number, use the schedule list
   command.
   mirrorthrottle Specifies whether mirror throttling is enabled (true) or
   disabled (false). The default is true. Throttling is set on the source
   volume and applies to all its mirrors.
   namecontainerdatathreshold (Available from v6.0.1) Limits the size of
   the name container. Value must be in MB. If this is set and the name
   container size limit:
     * Has not yet been reached, the first 64 KB of data is stored in the
       name container until the limit is reached. Once the limit is
       reached, only the metadata is stored in the name container and data
       is stored in data containers.
     * Has already been reached, only metadata is stored in the name
       container and all new data is spread across data containers. For
       example, if the current name container size is 200GB and the limit
       is set to 100GB, all new data is stored in data containers.
       If this parameter is set to 0, there is no limit on the size of
       data stored in the name container.

   nsminreplication The minimum replication level for the namespace
   container. Default: 2 When the replication factor falls below this
   minimum, re-replication occurs as aggressively as possible to restore
   the replication level. If any containers in the CLDB volume fall below
   the minimum replication factor, writes are disabled until aggressive
   re-replication restores the minimum level of replication. When enabled,
   the CLDB manages the namespace container replication separate from the
   data container replication. This capability is used when you have low
   volume replication but want to have higher namespace replication.

   This parameter must be the same or larger than the equivalent data
   replication parameter, minreplication.
   See also: [10]Understanding Replication.
   nsreplication The desired namespace container replication level.
   Default: 3. When the number of copies falls below the desired
   replication factor, but remains equal to or above the minimum
   replication factor, re-replication occurs after the timeout specified
   in the cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec parameter. This timeout is the time
   given for a down node to come back online. After this timeout period,
   the CLDB takes action to restore the replication factor. When enabled,
   the CLDB manages the namespace container replication separate from the
   data container replication. This capability is used when you have low
   volume replication but want to have higher namespace replication.

   By default, the value of this parameter is the same or larger than the
   value of the equivalent data replication parameter, replication.
   However, to set the value of this parameter lower than the replication
   value, first set engg.manual.override to true in cldb.conf.
   See also: [11]Understanding Replication.
   name The name of the volume to modify.
   offloadschedule The ID of the schedule to associate with the volume for
   offloading volume data to the tier. To disable schedule-based offload,
   set value to 0.
   quota The quota for the volume as integer plus unit. Example:
   quota=500G; Units: B, K, M, G, T, P

   Note that quotas for source and mirror volumes must match.
   readAce Specifies [12]Access Control Expressions (ACEs) that grant
   permissions at the volume level to read files and tables in the volume.
   The default value is p, which grants access to all users.

   An ACE (up to 2KB in length) is a combination of users, groups, and/or
   roles for whom access (to volume data) is defined using boolean
   expressions and subexpressions within single quotes. When you pass in
   an access type that has already been set, the new value will replace
   the existing value for that access type. There will be no change to
   access types that are not passed in with the command, whether or not
   they were set.
   readonly Specifies whether the volume is read-only.
     * 0 = read/write
     * 1 = read-only

   recallexpirytime The amount of time to keep the recalled data before
   purging or offloading it. Value must be greater than 1 and lesser than
   7500. The default value is 1 day.
   replication The desired replication level. Default: 0
   Tip: For more information, see [13]Understanding Replication.
   rereplicationtimeoutsec Timeout (in seconds) before attempting
   re-replication of replica containers. This volume property defines the
   timeout period until CLDB starts re-replicating the containers on the
   node of the volume when CLDB stops receiving a heartbeat from the node.

   When a node is down, CLDB gives the node an hour to come back online
   before it takes any action for the containers on this node. This
   parameter can be set on volumes to reduce the default 1 hour to a
   shorter time period. This option is provided mainly for local volumes,
   repl=1 so that when an MapR Filesystem is down, CLDB can give up
   quickly and decide that the container has no master. This forces the TT
   to give up on local containers, and take the appropriate recovery
   action of deleting the mapred volume and creating another one.
   schedule A schedule ID. If a schedule ID is provided, then the volume
   automatically creates snapshots (normal volume) or syncs with its
   source volume (mirror volume) on the specified schedule.

   To disable the schedule, set this parameter to 0.
   source (Mirror volumes only) The source volume from which a mirror
   volume receives updates, specified in the format <volume>@<cluster>.
   tierencryption (For cold tier only) Specifies whether to enable (true)
   or disable (false) encryption of data. If enabled, user data is
   encrypted before written to the object and HTTPs protocol is used for
   communication with the object store to ensure data is encrypted both on
   the wire and on the tier.

   This can be set only if a tier name is also specified and cannot be
   modified once set.

   If true, you can also specify a custom key using the tierkey parameter.
   If true, MAST Gateway uses HTTPS to upload data to the cold-tier. If
   the cold tier does not support HTTPS, all tier related operations will
   fail. If the cold tier does not support HTTPS, you must explicitly set
   the value for this to false at the time of associating a tier with the
   volume because the default value for this parameter is true.
   Tip: For warm tier, use -dare option on the front-end volume to enable
   or disable encryption of data-at-rest.
   tieringrule The name of the rule to use for offloading data to the
   tier.
   tierkey (For cold tier only) The 32 character HEX string to use for
   encryption. If this is not specified, CLDB generates a 32 character HEX
   string to use for encrypting the data to offload to the tier.

   You cannot modify the tierkey that is already associated with the
   volume.
   tiername The name of the tier to use for offloading data. This can be
   set only once and after it is set, it cannot be modified.
   type If type = mirror, the volume is converted from a rw (read/write)
   volume to a mirror volume.

   If type = rw, the volume is converted from a mirror volume to a rw
   (read/write) volume.
   user Space-separated list of user:permission pairs.
   wiresecurityenabled Enables (true) or disables (false) on-wire
   encryption for all files, tables, and streams in the volume. If true,
   this setting overrides all file, table, and stream level encryption
   settings (set using hadoop mfs command) and enables on-wire encryption
   for all files, tables, and streams. If this is disabled (false) at the
   volume level and is enabled at the file, table, and/or stream level,
   the file, table, and/or stream level encryption setting overrides this
   setting on those files, tables, and streams where it is enabled; for
   all other files, tables, and streams where encryption is not enabled at
   the file, table, and/or stream level, on-wire encryption is disabled.
   writeAce Specifies [14]Access Control Expressions (ACEs) that grant
   permission at the volume level to write to files and tables in the
   volume. The default value is p, which grants access to all users.

   An ACE (up to 2KB in length) is a combination of users, groups, and/or
   roles for whom access is defined using boolean expressions and
   subexpressions within single quotes. When you pass in an access type
   that has already been set, the new value will replace the existing
   value for that access type. There will be no change to access types
   that are not passed in with the command, whether or not they were set.

   Modify a volume to allow inheritance by a child volume

   Sub-volumes (children) can inherit properties from their parent volume.
   The maprcli volume create and volume modify commands provide parameters
   for setting the inheritance feature. In order for child volume to
   inherit from a parent volume, the parent volume must grant permission
   and the child volume must be created specifying the volume name of the
   parent. In the following example, the parent volume, parentVol, grants
   of inheritance to child volumes.
     * [19]CLI
     * [20]REST
