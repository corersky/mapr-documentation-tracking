cluster gateway list

   Lists all of the gateways that a source MapR cluster is using.

   The source MapR cluster is using gateways either for replication of
   table data to destination MapR clusters or for the indexing of table
   data in Elasticsearch clusters.

   This list is created by the maprcli cluster gateway set command.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway list
    [ -cluster <sourceCluster> ]

   REST

http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/cluster/gateway/list

Parameters

   Parameter Description

   source cluster that this command should be run on.

Example

   Lists all the gateways that a source MapR cluster can use when
   replicating table data in MapR clusters or indexing data in
   Elasticsearch clusters. In this example, supposing newyork to be the
   name of a MapR cluster that is a destination for table replication, the
   output shows two gateways that are available for replicating to this
   cluster.
