table cf edit

   Edits a column family in a binary table or JSON table.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * createrenamefamilyperm on the table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description
   path

   The path to the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under volume1 which has
       a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/test

     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named test under volume1
       in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   cfname

   The name of the column family to edit.
   newcfname The new name to give to the column family.
   minversions Applies to binary tables only: Minimum number of versions
   of column values to keep. The default is zero.
   maxversions Applies to binary tables only: Maximum number of versions
   of column values to keep. The default is one.
   ttl Time to live in seconds. When the age of the data in this column
   family exceeds the value of the ttl parameter, the data is purged.
   Setting the value of ttl to 0 is equivalent to allowing data to remain
   indefinitely. Default: 0
   Note: If the value of -ttl for an existing column family in a JSON
   table is not 0, you cannot add another column family. You also cannot
   set the TTL for a JSON table if it has secondary indexes. See
   [4]Setting TTL for Data.
   inmemory

   Boolean. Determines whether preference is given to values of this
   column family for storage with row keys. Because row keys are cached in
   memory in preference to row data, column-family data that is stored
   inline with the row keys is also cached in memory.

   For all column families in a table together, up to 200 bytes of row
   data will be stored inline with each row key. Storing data inline with
   a row key might speed retrieval of the data from a column family
   because disk access can often be avoided. For each column family, up to
   32 bytes can be stored inline with each row key even if its inmemory
   parameter is set to false, but preference will be given to column
   families where this parameter is set to true. A column family can have
   more than 32 bytes stored inline if its inmemory parameter is set to
   true.

   If the total number of bytes for all column families together exceeds
   200 for a row, then preference for inclusion within the inline storage
   for that row is given to column families that have the inmemory
   parameter set to true.
   Note: All of the data for a column family will be stored in-line with
   the row key, or none will be. If the contents in a column family for a
   particular row are larger than the maximum number of bytes that are
   allowed to be stored for that column family, no data at all will be
   stored in-line for that column family.

   The default value for the inmemory parameter is false.
   compression The compression setting to use for the column family. Valid
   options are off, lzf, lz4, and zlib. The default setting is equal to
   the compression setting for the directory in which the table is
   located. To find out whether a directory is compressed and the type of
   compression, see [5]Turning Compression On or Off on Directories Using
   the CLI.
   versionperm Applies to binary tables only: The Access Control
   Expression for changing the value of the maxversions and minversions
   parameters. By default, permission is given to the value of
   defaultversionperm for the table.
   compressionperm Applies to binary tables only: The Access Control
   Expression for changing the value of the compression parameter. By
   default, permission is given to the value of defaultcompressionperm for
   the table.
   memoryperm The Access Control Expression for changing the value of the
   inmemory parameter. Use single quotation marks around the ACE. By
   default, permission is given to the value of defaultmemoryperm for the
   table.
   readperm

   The Access Control Expression for column reads. Use single quotation
   marks around the ACE.

   Reads require permission both at the column-family level and at the
   column level (for binary tables) or field level (for JSON tables). In
   JSON tables, this permission is inherited by fields within the column
   family.

   By default, permission is given to the value of defaultreadperm for the
   table.
   writeperm

   The Access Control Expression for column writes (puts and deletes). Use
   single quotation marks around the ACE.

   Writes require permission both at the column-family level and at the
   column level (for binary tables) or field level (for JSON tables). In
   JSON tables, this permission is inherited by fields within the column
   family.

   By default, permission is given to the value of defaultwriteperm for
   the table.
   appendperm

   Applies to binary tables only: The Access Control Expression for column
   appends. Use single quotation marks around the ACE.

   Column appends require permission both at the column-family level and
   at the column level. By default, permission is given to the value of
   defaultappendperm for the table.
   traverseperm
   Applies to JSON tables only: The Access Control Expressions that
   specifies who has permission to pass over fields in JSON documents. For
   example, suppose that a JSON table contains documents of this general
   structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" : "value",
               "c" : "value"
          }
}

   Suppose further that the user sjohnson has read permission on a.b, but
   not on a. For sjohnson to read a.b, the user needs the traverse
   permission on a. The user can then pass over field a to a.b.

   This permission is inherited by fields within the column family. By
   default, this permission is given to the value of defaulttraverseperm
   for the JSON table.
   Note: If a field is specified as a column family JSON path name, that
   field cannot be defined as either an indexed or included field when
   creating an index. For example, suppose you have the following JSON
   table:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                   {
                       "c" : "value",
                       "d" : "value"
                   },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}

   If you created a column family at field c in the JSON path a.b.c, when
   creating an index, field a.b.c cannot be defined as an indexed or
   included field. However, you can define, as either an indexed or
   included field, fields a, a.b, a.b.d.

Example

   Changes the name of a column family in table mytable from mycf to
   mynewcfname. Also changes the time to live setting.

   CLI

maprcli table cf edit -path /my.cluster.com/volume1/mytable -cfname mycf \
  -newcfname mynewcfname -ttl 86400

   REST

curl -k -X POST \
  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/cf/edit?path=%2Fmy.cluster.com%2Fvolume1%2
Fmytable&cfname=mycf&newcfname=mynewcfname&ttl=86400' \
