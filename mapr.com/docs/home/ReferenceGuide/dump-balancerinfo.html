dump balancerinfo

   Returns detailed information about the storage pools on a cluster. If
   there are any active container moves, the command returns information
   about the source and destination storage pools.

   The maprcli dump balancerinfo command enables you to see how much space
   is used in storage pools and to track active container moves. For best
   results, use the -json option when running dump balancerinfo from the
   command line.

   The disk space balancer is a tool that balances disk space usage on a
   cluster by moving containers between storage pools. Whenever a storage
   pool is over 70% full (or a threshold defined by the
   cldb.balancer.disk.threshold.percentage parameter), the disk space
   balancer distributes containers to other storage pools that have lower
   utilization than the average for that cluster. The disk space balancer
   aims to ensure that the percentage of space used on all the disks in
   the node is similar. For more information, see [1]Disk Space Balancer.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli dump balancerinfo
    [-cluster <cluster name>]

   REST
          N/A

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description

   cluster

   The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is omitted,
   the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.

Output

   The maprcli dump balancerinfo command returns detailed information
   about the storage pools on a cluster. If there are any active container
   moves, the command returns information about the source and destination
   storage pools.

   Output fields

   CAPTION:

   Field

   Description

   spid

   The unique ID number of the storage pool.

   fsid

   The unique ID number of the file server. The FSID identifies an MapR
   Filesystem instance or a node that has MapR Filesystem running in the
   cluster. Typically, each node has a group of storage pools, so the same
   FSID will correspond to multiple SPIDs.

   ip:port

   The host IP address and MapR Filesystem port.

   capacityMB

   The total capacity of the storage pool (in MB).

   usedMB

   The amount of space used on the storage pool (in MB).

   percentage

   The percentage of the storage pool currently utilized. A ratio of the
   space used (usedMB) to the total capacity (capacityMB) of the storage
   pool.

   fullnessLevel

   The fullness of the storage pool relative to the fullness of the rest
   of the cluster. Possible values are OverUsed, AboveAverage, Average,
   BelowAverage, and UnderUsed. For more information, see Monitoring
   storage pool space usage below.

   inTransitMB

   The amount of data (in MB) that the disk space balancer is currently
   moving into a storage pool.

   outTransitMB

   The amount of data (in MB) that the disk space balancer is currently
   moving out of a storage pool.

   The following fields are returned only if the disk space balancer is
   actively moving one or more containers at the time the command is run.

   CAPTION:

   Field

   Description

   containerid

   The unique ID number of the container.

   sizeMB

   The amount of data (in MB) being moved.

   From fsid

   The FSID (file server ID number) of the source file server.

   From IP:Port

   The IP address and port number of the source node.

   From SP

   The SPID (storage pool ID) of the source storage pool.

   To fsid

   The FSID (file server ID number) of the destination file server.

   To IP:Port

   The IP address and port number of the destination node.

   To SP

   The SPID (storage pool ID number) of the destination storage pool.

Examples

   Monitoring storage pool space usage

   You can use the maprcli dump balancerinfo command to monitor space
   usage on storage pools.
# maprcli dump balancerinfo -json

....
{
                        "spid":"4bc329ce06752062004fa1a537abcefg",
                        "fsid":5410063549464613987,
                        "ip:port":"10.50.60.72:5660-",
                        "capacityMB":1585096,
                        "usedMB":1118099,
                        "percentage":70,
                        "fullnessLevel":"AboveAverage",
                        "inTransitMB":0,
                        "outTransitMB":31874
                },

   Tracking active container moves

   Using the maprcli dump balancerinfo command you can monitor the
   activity of the disk space balancer. Whenever there are active
   container moves, the command returns information about the source and
   destination storage pools.
# maprcli dump balancerinfo -json
      ....
      {
           "containerid":7840,
           "sizeMB":15634,
           "From fsid":8081858704500413174,
           "From IP:Port":"10.50.60.64:5660-",
           "From SP":"9e649bf0ac6fb9f7004fa19d20rstuvw",
           "To fsid":3770844641152008527,
           "To IP:Port":"10.50.60.73:5660-",
           "To SP":"fefcc342475f0286004fad963flmnopq"
       }

   The example shows that a container (7840) is being moved from a storage
   pool on node 10.50.60.64 to a storage pool on node 10.50.60.73.
   Tip: You can use the storage pool IDs (SPIDs) to search the CLDB and
   MapR Filesystem logs for activity (balancer moves, container moves,
   creates, deletes, etc.) related to specific storage pools.
