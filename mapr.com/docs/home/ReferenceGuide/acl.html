acl

   Describes the acl commands used to access control lists (ACLs).

Specifying Permissions

   Specify permissions for a user or group with a string that lists the
   permissions for that user or group. To specify permissions for multiple
   users or groups, use a string for each, separated by spaces. The format
   is as follows:
     * Users -
<user>:<action>[,<action>...][<user>:<action>[,<action...]]
     * Groups -
<group>:<action>[,<action>...][<group>:<action>[,<action...]]

   To use the acl edit command, you must have full control (fc) permission
   on the cluster or volume for which you are running the command.

   The following tables list the permission codes used by the acl
   commands.
