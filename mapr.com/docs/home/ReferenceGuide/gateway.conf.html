gateway.conf

   Describes configuration parameters for the MapR gateway.

   The /opt/mapr/conf/gateway.conf file specifies configuration parameters
   for the gateway that supports table and stream replication.
   Warning: Changing the gateway.conf default settings is not recommended
   and is not likely to improve performance. If you still need to make
   changes to the gateway.conf file, you must restart the gateway after
   doing so. See [1]Configuring Gateways for Table and Stream Replication.

   Field

   Default

   Description

   gateway.port

   7660

   The gateway listening port.

   gateway.receive.numthreads

   128

   The number of worker threads to receive replication stream requests.

   gateway.flush.numthreads

   128

   The number of flush threads to send put requests to replicas.

   gateway.put.mem.mb

   128

   The maximum size limit (in MB) of the putbuffer memory.

   gateway.logfile.size.mb

   1024

   The maximum size limit (in MB) of the MapR gateway log file. When the
   size limit is reached, the logs get rolled over.

   gateway.es.request.maxsize.kb

   128

   The maximum size limit (in KB) of replication requests distributed by
   MapR source clusters. This property is no longer supported.
