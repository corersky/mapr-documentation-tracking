table index add

   This topic describes how to add secondary indexes on MapR-DB JSON
   tables.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce on the volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the table path
     * indexperm permission on the table

   If you created the table in version 6.0 or later, you automatically
   have indexperm permission. For tables created before 6.0, even if you
   are the owner of the table, you must explicitly add indexperm
   permission.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table index add
  -path <path>
  -index <index name>
  -indexedfields < indexed field names >
  [ -includedfields < included field names > ]
  [ -hashed [ enable hashed index: true | false> ]
  [ -numhashpartitions < number of hash index partitions when hashed index is en
abled > ]

   REST

curl -k -X POST \
  'http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/table/index/add?path=<path>&index=<index name>&i
ndexedfields=<indexed field names>&<parameters>' \
  -u <username>:<password>

Parameters

   Parameter Description

   path
   (Required) Path to where the parent JSON table resides.

   index
   (Required) Name of the index.
   indexedfields (Required) Names of the indexed fields. This is a comma
   separated list of the fields from the JSON table that are indexed and
   used for ordering the index. The sort ordering of each field can be
   specified separately. The syntax is as follows:
-indexedfields <fieldname>:<sort_order>,<fieldname>:<sort_order>,...

   Important: Do not place a space between the commas and the field names.

   A sort_order of asc, ASC, or 1 denotes an ascending sort order. This is
   the default.

   A sort _order of desc, DESC, or -1 denotes a descending sort order.
   The following example specifies two indexed fields. fieldName1 has an
   ascending sort, while fieldName2 is descending.
-indexedfields fieldName1:asc,fieldName2:desc

   If an indexed field contains a colon (:) in the name, you need to
   escape the last colon in the name. In the example below, the indexed
   field names are the following:
    1. field1
    2. field2
    3. colonField:X:Y

   The following shows how to escape the last colon in the third indexed
   field.
-indexedfields field1,field2,colonField:X\\:Y

   Note: The CAST function can be applied on indexed fields. You must
   enclose each CAST function call in single quotes. See the next section
   for details.
   includedfields (Optional) Names of the included fields. This is a comma
   separated list of the fields from the JSON table that are part of the
   index, but not used for ordering. The syntax is as follows:
-includedfields <fieldname>,<fieldname>,...

   Important: Do not place a space between the commas and the included
   field names.
   hashed (Optional) True | False. Default: false
   numhashpartitions (Optional) Number of [1]hash index partitions when
   the hashed index option is enabled. This parameter determines the
   number of logical partitions MapR-DB distributes keys across. Incoming
   keys are hashed to 2 byte partition IDs. Default: 10

Applying CAST on Indexed Fields

   Indexes can be defined with the CAST function applied to an indexed
   field.

   The following statement queries a table named lineitem and casts the
   L_LINENUMBER and L_ORDERKEY fields to the int data type.
SELECT L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHERE CAST(L_LINENUMBER as int) =
1 AND CAST(L_ORDERKEY as int) = 550;

   To optimize the previous statement, you can create an index on the
   L_LINENUMBER and L_ORDERKEY fields, and use the CAST function to map
   each field to a specific data type, as shown below:
maprcli table index add \
  -path /drill/testdata/qa/sf1/maprdb/json/lineitem \
  -index l_cast_comp_1 -indexedfields '$CAST(L_LINENUMBER@INT)','$CAST(L_ORDERKE
Y@INT)' \
  -includedfields L_LINESTATUS,L_QUANTITY

   The index stores the values of the L_LINENUMBER and L_ORDERKEY fields
   as the int data type. MapR-DB can use the index for any subsequent
   queries that cast these fields to int instead of accessing data in the
   primary table and converting the values to int.

   See [2]Using Casts in Secondary Indexes for more information.

Restrictions

   The following restrictions apply to creating indexes.

   Type Restrictions

          + Indexed fields must contain scalar types.
            Scalar types include integer, character, boolean, string, and
            byte. See [3]Data Types and Secondary Index Fields for the
            complete list of types.
          + Indexed fields cannot contain nested documents.
            An indexed field can be a subfield of a nested document,
            provided the subfield contains scalar types.
          + Indexed fields cannot contain arrays.

   Size Restrictions

          + The maximum size of all indexed fields in an index is 32 KB.
            If the collective size exceeds 32 KB, then an insert of the
            corresponding document results in an encoding error
            (INDEX_ROW_KEY_ENCODER_ERROR_ENCODING_IS_TOO_LONG).
          + The maximum number of indexes that you can create on a JSON
            table is 32.

   Field Definition Restrictions

          + You cannot specify individual array elements as indexed
            fields.
          + You cannot specify a table's _id field as an indexed field.
          + You can include a specific field only once as either an
            indexed or included field, except if you cast the field to
            different types.
            For example:
               o You can create an index in which the score field is an
                 indexed field cast as a double type, and score is also an
                 included field.
                 The included field retains the original data type of the
                 score field.
maprcli table index add -path /castTable \
   -index castIdx1 \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(score@DOUBLE)' \
   -includedFields score
               o You can create an index in which the score field is an
                 indexed field, cast as a double type, and the score field
                 is also another indexed field, cast as a long type.
maprcli table index add -path /castTable \
   -index castIdx2 \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(score@DOUBLE)','$CAST(score@LONG)'
          + You cannot use casts with included fields.
          + You cannot specify a field as either an indexed or included
            field if the field is also specified as a column family JSON
            path name.
            For example, suppose you have the following JSON table:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                         "d" : "value"
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}
            If you create a column family at field c in the JSON path
            a.b.c, you cannot define field a.b.c as either an indexed or
            included field. You can define the fields a, a.b, and a.b.d as
            either indexed or included fields.
          + You cannot specify an included field in which the data in the
            field spans more than one column family.
            In the following example, the included field sl1.sl2 spans
            column families, cf2 and cf3:
maprcli table cf list -path /cftab
compressionperm  readperm  traverseperm  jsonfamilypath   writeperm  minversions
  maxversions  compression  ttl         inmemory  cfname   memoryperm
u:root           u:root    u:root                         u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     default  u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1              u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf1      u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1.sl2.sl3      u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf2      u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4  u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf3      u:root

maprcli table index add -path /cftab -index i1 -indexedfields sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4.l4
a, sl1.l1a -includedfields sl1.sl2,sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4.sl5.l5b -json
{
        "timestamp":1507419777919,
        "timeofday":"2017-10-07 04:42:57.919 GMT-0700 PM",
        "status":"ERROR",
        "errors":[
                {
                        "id":22,
                        "desc":"Data for included field sl1.sl2 may not span mor
e than one column family."
                }
         ]
}

   Option Restrictions

          + Because indexes are automatically split, you cannot disable
            splits when you create your index.

   Index Use Restrictions

          + Indexes optimize filter conditions if you compare indexed
            fields against scalar values, and the field and scalar value
            have [4]comparable types.
          + Indexes do not optimize non-existence filter conditions.
