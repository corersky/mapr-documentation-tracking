expandaudit

   As operations are performed on the directories, files, and tables that
   you are auditing, the audit logs capture records of those operations.
   Those records identify the affected directories, files, and tables by
   means of file IDs, the volumes on which the operations took place by
   means of volume identifiers, and the users who performed the operations
   by means of user IDs. These IDs are used instead of names in the audit
   records because fetching the actual names of these objects and users in
   real-time is costly in terms of performance.

   You can use the expandaudit utility, however, to create copies of your
   logs files in which the IDs are resolved into names and inserted into
   the audit records.

   This utility acts on audit logs that exist in the current MapR cluster
   at the time that the utility is run.

Restrictions

   This utility operates on audit logs for filesystem operations and
   MapR-DB operations, which are logged in a local MapR volume on each
   node where the operations are performed. These operations are logged in
   FSAudit and DBAudit log files.
   File identifiers are converted to names only when either of these
   conditions is met:
     * The file exists at the time that expandaudit is run.
     * The file has been deleted but the deletion of the file was logged
       and the log files being processed by expandaudit include the record
       of the file deletion.

   If a volume is deleted, expandaudit will not be able to convert
   identifiers for files that were in the volume unless the creation of
   the volume and files were logged.

   If the creation of a file is audited and the file is later renamed, the
   file ID is converted to the current name.

Permissions

   Although the permissions on the tool are 755, the tool generates output
   only when run by root or the user mapr.

Syntax

expandaudit
    -volumename <volume name> | -volumeid <volume identifier>
    -o <output directory>
    [ -d ]
    [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
    [ -t <number of threads> ]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   cluster The name of the cluster on which to run the command.
   d Required for deleted volumes as it indicates volume was deleted. If
   this is specified, user specified volume name is used during expansion.
   volumename The name of the volume being audited. If neither this
   parameter nor the -volumeid parameter is used, all audit logs on the
   cluster are included in the operation.
   volumeid The ID of the volume being audited. If neither this parameter
   nor the -volumename parameter is used, all audit logs on the cluster
   are included in the operation.
   o The directory in the MapR file system in which to create the copies
   of the audit logs. The directory must already exist.
   The directory structure is:
<output directory>/<volume id>/<node>/<day>/<expanded audit log files>

   The file names are the same as the names of the input files, though you
   might see the following extensions:
     * .part : If present, this extension is on the log file with the most
       recent date. The input log file that corresponds to this output
       file might still have been receiving new audit records at the time
       that the expandaudit utility was run. If the utility is run again
       with the same output directory, the utility will update the .part
       file by including the most recent records and converting the
       identifiers in those records.
     * .pending: This extension indicates files that contain one or more
       identifiers that the utility could not convert.

   Note: Sometimes, you might see a combination of these two types of
   files, part.pending, which indicates a problem converting identifiers
   in the most recent audit file.
   t The number of threads to use for parallel expansion across cluster
   nodes. The default value is 10.
