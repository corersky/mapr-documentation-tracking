MapR Database JSON CopyTable

   Copies data from one MapR Database JSON table to another MapR Database
   JSON table.

   If the destination table does not exist, mapr copytable creates the
   destination table with the same metadata (column families and access
   control expressions) as the source table, and then copies data.

   If the destination table exists, mapr copytable copies data only.

Required Permissions

   The user that runs mapr copytable must have the following permissions,
   which you can grant with access-control expressions:
     * The permission readAce on the volume where the source table is
       located, and the permission writeAce on the volume where the
       destination table is or will be located.
     * The permission adminperm on the source table.
     * The permission for column-family and column reads (readperm) on the
       data in the source table that you want to copy.
     * When bulkload = false, the permission for column writes (writeperm)
       on the destination table.
     * When bulkload = true (default), the permission to load the
       destination table with bulk loads (bulkloadperm).
     * If the destination table does not yet exist: createrenamefamily on
       the source table.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [1]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on tables, see [2]Enabling
   Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

mapr copytable
-src <source table path>
-dst <destination table path>
[-fromID <start key>]
[-toID <end key>]
[-bulkload <true|false> (default: true)]
[-mapreduce <true|false> (default: true)]
[-cmpmeta <true|false> (default: true)]
[-numthreads <number of threads> (default: 16)

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   src The path of the table that you want to copy from.
   dst The path of the table that you want to copy to.
   fromID

   The value of the _id field in the first document of the range of
   documents to copy.

   startRow is an alias for this parameter.
   toID

   The value of the _id field in the last document of the range of
   documents to copy.

   stopRow is an alias for this parameter.
   bulkload A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to perform a
   full bulk load of the table. The default is not to use bulk loading
   (true). After a bulk load, you must set the -bulkload parameter of the
   table to false by running the command maprcli table edit -path <path to
   table> -bulkload false.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the copying operation. The default, preferred method
   is to use a MapReduce program (true).

   When this parameter is set to false, a client process uses multiple
   threads to read rows of the source table and write rows to the
   destination table.
   cmpmeta A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to compare table
   metadata such as column families and ACEs. The default is to compare
   metadata (true). Such comparisons are done when the destination table
   exists before mapr copytable is run and checks that the user ID that
   runs mapr copytable has the proper permissions on the destination
   table.

   Set the value of this parameter to false before copying a table that
   contains a single column family to a table that contains two or more
   column families.
   numthreads When -mapreduce is false, this parameter specifies the
   number of threads allocated to perform the copying of data. The default
   is 16. If additional CPU resources are available, you might want to
   increase the number of threads to achieve better performance.

Example

   The following example copies documents starting from ID user000001 to
   ID user009999:
[user@hostname ~]$ mapr copytable -src /user1/tableA -dst
/mapr/clusterB/vol1/tableB -fromID user000001 -toID user009999

Monitoring mapr copytable Operations

   Use one of the following methods to monitor the progress of the copying
   of table data:
     * If the copy table operation runs as a MapReduce v2 application,
       monitor the application using the ResourceManager UI.
     * If the copy table operation runs as a client process, go to the
       Tables view of the destination table in the MapR Control System.
       Then, on the Region tab, monitor the pace at which the number of
       rows increases.
