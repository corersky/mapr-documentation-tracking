Memory Allocation Alarm

   UI Column
          Memory Allocation Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_EXCEEDED

   Meaning
          The percentage of system memory required to run services on the
          node exceeds the set threshold and could potentially overload
          the node. If you installed a service on the node that causes the
          sum of memory used by the services on the node to exceed the
          threshold set, the system raises the alarm.

   Resolution
          To clear the alarm, you can add more memory to the node, stop a
          service from running on the node, or remove a service from the
          node. You can run the service list command to see the memory
          allocated to each service on the node. See [1]service list for
          more information.

          The services.memoryallocation.alarm.threshold property in
          warden.conf defines the maximum amount of system memory that
          services running on the node can use before triggering the
          alarm. The default setting for this property is 95 percent:

          services.memoryallocation.alarm.threshold=95

          The percentage of system memory that services can use on the
          node should not exceed 95. Restart the Warden service on the
          node after you edit the warden.conf file.
