Monitoring Using MCS and the CLI

   The Overview displays a summary of information about the cluster in six
   panes including information on cluster health, activity, and usage.
   Note: During installation using the MapR Installer, you can configure
   metrics and logging using settings on the Monitoring page of the MapR
   Installer user interface. The metrics collection infrastructure must be
   installed because the MapR Control System relies on these metrics to
   provide graphs and charts in the Overview page. If the metrics
   collection infrastructure is not installed, you cannot visualize the
   metrics in the Overview page. If you want, you can install metrics
   collection or logging at any time by selecting the feature during an
   [1]Incremental Install.

   The following sections provide information about each pane.
