Duplicate Host ID

   UI Column
          Duplicate Host Id

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_DUPLICATE_HOSTID

   Meaning
          Two or more nodes in the cluster have the same host ID.

   Resolution
          Multiple nodes with the same host ID are prevented from joining
          the cluster, in order to prevent addressing problems that can
          lead to data loss. To correct the problem and clear the alarm,
          make sure all host IDs are unique and use the maprcli node
          allow-into-cluster command to un-ban the affected host IDs.
