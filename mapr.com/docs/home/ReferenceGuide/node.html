node

   Manages nodes in the cluster

Fields

   The following table lists the data fields that provide information
   about each node. Each field has two names:
     * Field name - displayed in the output of the node list command
     * Short name - used to specify the columns displayed using the
       columns parameter

   The short name is also used when specifying rows with a filter, for
   example when specifying nodes on which to perform an action with the
   node services command.
