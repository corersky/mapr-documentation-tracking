stream replica add

   Registers an existing stream as a replica of the specified stream.

Permissions Required at the Source Cluster

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm and copyperm permissions on the source stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this command unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.

Permissions Required at the Target Cluster

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [4]readAce and [5]writeAce on the volume
     * [6]lookupdir on directories in the path

Syntax

   CLI
maprcli stream replica add
         -path <stream path>
         -replica <remote stream path>
        [ -paused <start replication in paused state> default: false ]
        [ -throttle <throttle replication operations under load> default: false
]

        [ -synchronous <replicate to remote stream before acknowledging producer
s> default: false ]
        [ -networkcompression <on-wire compression type: off|lz4|lzf|zlib> defau
lt: compression setting on stream ]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path The path and name of the stream that you want to create a replica
   for.
   replica The path and name of the stream that you want to create as a
   replica of the stream that you specified with the -path parameter.
   paused A boolean value that specifies whether to pause the replication
   so that it does not start immediately. The replication can be resumed
   using the replica resume command at a later time. The values are true
   or false. The default is false.

   Set -paused to true if you want to run mapr copystream to load the
   replica stream before starting replication. If it is not paused,
   replication starts immediately after you run the commands maprcli
   stream replica add and maprcli stream upstream add, in which case the
   replica stream starts empty and accumulates messages over time. If you
   are interested only in the messages that are published to the source
   stream after replication starts, then you do not need to pause
   replication initially. However, if you want the full set of messages
   from the source stream that have not yet been purged or marked for
   deletion, then pause replication initially.
   throttle A boolean value that specifies whether to throttle replication
   operations. Throttle the replication stream to minimize the impact of
   the replication process on incoming operations during periods of heavy
   load. The values are true or false. The default is false.
   Throttling has two effects, both of which allow MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka to use more system resources to process new messages:
     * Throttling slows down the rate at which changes to a stream are
       replicated.
     * Throttling slows down the rate at which messages to be replicated
       are read from disk.

   networkencryption A boolean value that specifies whether or not to
   enable on-wire encryption. The values are true or false. The default is
   false. If you set the value to true, the local cluster and any other
   cluster that is part of the replication process must be enabled for
   security.
   synchronous A boolean value that specifies whether replication is
   synchronous or asynchronous. The values are true or false. The default
   is false and specifies asynchronous replication.
   networkcompression Specifies the type of compression to use when
   replicating messages. For more information, see [7]Managing
   Compression.
