Tiny Buckets Flush Alarm

   UI Column
          Lot of Tiny Buckets Flushed

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_TINY_BUCKET_FLUSH

   Meaning
          Indicates lot of small buckets (<= 8mb) are getting flushed in
          DB resulting in performance degradation. You may see put
          operation performance going down during this phase and will need
          to take corrective actions to fix it. This will not bring down
          the cluster and data is still accessible.

   Resolution
          Increase memory for MFS as number of active tablets is very
          high.
