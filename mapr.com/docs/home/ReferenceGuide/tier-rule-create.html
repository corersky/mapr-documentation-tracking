   REST

          Request Type POST
          Request URL
http[s]://<host:port>/rest/tier/rule/create?<parameters>

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   cluster The name of the cluster on which to run the command.
   expr The criteria for offloading data. The criteria can be defined
   using a combination of the following:
   u Username or user ID, as configured in the OS registry (such as
   /etc/passwd file, LDAP, etc.), of a specific user.

   Usage: u:<username or user ID>
   g Group name or group ID, as configured in the OS registry (such as
   /etc/group file, LDAP, etc.), of a specific group.

   Usage: u:<groupname or group ID>
   m (mtime) Time (in seconds or days) since the files were last modified.
   The number of seconds can be specified by appending s to value and the
   number of days can be specified by appending d to the value.

   Usage:
     * "m:<value>s" — specifies mtime in seconds
     * "m:<value>d" — specifies mtime in days

   All files whose modification timestamp (mtime) exceeds the specified
   amount of time are offloaded.
   Note: If the system time on CLDB and file server nodes are different,
   the mtime rule for offloading data may not work as intended.
   s The size of the file in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.
   The size of the file can be specified by appending one of the following
   to the value: b for bytes, k for kilobytes, m for megabytes, or g for
   gigabytes.

   Usage
     * "s:<value>b" — specifies filesize in bytes
     * "s:<value>k" — specifies filesize in KB
     * "s:<value>m" — specifies filesize in MB
     * "s:<value>g" — specifies filesize in GB

   All files whose size exceeds the specified size are offloaded.
   Or, use the following:
   p (Default) Specifies all files. Specifies that this operation is
   applicable to all the files without restriction. This cannot be
   combined with any other operator.
   "" Indicates none of the files. Specifies that this operation cannot be
   performed on any of the files.
   Use the following to string multiple criteria for offload:
   & AND operation to combine multiple expressions as the criteria for the
   rule.
   | OR operation to indicate either of the expressions as the criteria
   for the rule.
   () Delimiters for subexpressions.
   name The name of the rule.
