Parameters

   The normal command syntax is to specify a single option from the
   following table, along with its corresponding arguments. If you do not
   set compression and chunk size for a given directory, the values are
   inherited from the parent directory.

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description
   -count <path> Counts and returns the number of directories and
   (regular, symbolic link, volume link, kvstores, and device) files in
   the specified path (recursively).
   -delace [-R] <path> Deletes all [1]ACEs associated with the specified
   file or directory and sets ACEs for the specified file or directory to
   the default value, which is the empty string. Here:
     * [-R] — Enables recursion allowing you to perform the operation in
       subdirectories as well.
     * <path> — Specifies the path to the file or directory.

   You cannot delete specific access types with this parameter. Instead,
   if necessary, reset the value for the specific access type to an empty
   string using the -setace parameter. If you use an empty string to deny
   a specific type of access, then that type of access is denied to all
   users. To deny specific types of access to specific users only, use the
   negation operator (!). The mode bits corresponding to the ACEs being
   deleted, do not change.
   -getace [-R] <path> Returns the permissions -- POSIX mode bits and
   [2]ACEs -- for the given file or (recursively) for the directory.
   Recursion is enabled only if -R is specified; if -R is not specified,
   this parameter returns the permissions only for the given directory.
   Here:
     * [-R] — (Optional) Enables recursion allowing you to perform the
       operation in subdirectories as well.
     * <path> — (Required) Specifies the path to the file or directory.

   If one or more ACEs are available for the file or directory, a plus
   sign (+), which indicates that both ACEs and POSIX mode bits are set
   for the given file or directory, is returned. If the ACE on the file or
   directory is an empty string, the plus sign is not returned.
   -help <command> Displays help for the hadoop mfs command.
   -ln <target> <symlink> Creates a symbolic link <symlink> that points to
   the target path <target>, similar to the standard Linux ln -s command.
   -lnh <target> <hardlink> Creates a hardlink that associates a new name
   or a file path with an existing file. You must specify the following:

   <target>
          File name, including the full path, of the file to link to.

   <hardlink>
          New name, including the full path, of the file to link with.

   -ls <path> Lists files in the directory specified by <path>. The hadoop
   mfs -ls command corresponds to the standard hadoop fs -ls command, but
   provides the following additional information:
     * Chunks used for each file
     * Server where each chunk resides
     * Whether compression is enabled for each file
     * Whether encryption is enabled for each file
     * Whether audit is enabled (A) or disabled (U) for each file

   -lsd <path> Lists files in the directory specified by <path>, and also
   provides information about the specified directory itself:
     * Whether compression is enabled for the directory (indicated by z )
     * The configured chunk size (in bytes) for the directory.

   -lso <path> Lists files in the directory specified by <path>. The
   hadoop mfs -lso command corresponds to the standard hadoop fs -ls
   command, but provides the following additional information:
     * Whether compression is enabled for each file
     * Whether encryption is enabled for each file
     * Whether audit is enabled (A) or disabled (U) for each file

   This command is faster than hadoop fs -ls as it uses an optimized
   printing method to dump data on screen.
   -lsor <path> Recursively lists files in the directory specified by
   <path>. This command is the recursive variant of the hadoop mfs -lso
   command.
   -lsr <path> Recursively lists files in the directory and subdirectories
   specified by <path>. The hadoop mfs -lsr command corresponds to the
   standard hadoop fs -lsr command, but provides the following additional
   information:
     * Chunks used for each file
     * Server where each chunk resides

   -Lsr <path> Equivalent to lsr, but additionally dereferences symbolic
   links
   -lsrv <path> Lists all paths recursively without crossing volume links.
   -lss <path> Lists files in the directory specified by <path>, with an
   additional column that displays the number of disk blocks per file.
   Disk blocks are 8192 bytes.
   -offload <file_path> [-v] The file to offload to the storage tier. This
   is a blocking operation; the control is not returned until the
   operation is complete and the file has been offloaded. Use -v (for
   verbose) to view the status of the ongoing offload operation.
   -recall <file_path> [-v] The file to recall from the storage tier. This
   is a blocking operation; the control is not returned until the
   operation is complete and the file has been recalled. Use -v (for
   verbose) to view the status of the ongoing recall operation.
   -rmr <path> Recursively deletes files and directories in the specified
   path. This is a highly optimized version of the normal generic hadoop
   fs rmr command and is 10X faster for large directories. This option is
   useful when one or more directories in the specified path contains many
   (millions of) files.
   -setace [-R] [-readfile <ace>] [-writefile <ace>] [-executefile <ace>]
   [-addchild <ace>] [-deletechild <ace>] [-lookupdir <ace>] [-readdir
   <ace>] [-aces
   "[rf:<ace>],[wf:<ace>],[ef:<ace>],[ac:<ace>],[dc:<ace>],[rd:<ace>],[ld:
   <ace>]"] [-preservemodebits <true|false>] [-setinherit <true|false>]
   <path> Sets or modifies the read, write, and execute [3]permissions for
   files or directories. This argument will:
     * Overwrite existing values with new values, if specified, for access
       types that were previously set.
     * Set new values for access types that have not yet been set.
     * Not set or modify access types that were not passed in with the
       command, whether they were previously set or unset.

   Specify the ACEs immediately after the -setace parameter. Specify all
   the other parameters, after the ACEs.
   Here:

   -R
          Enables recursion allowing you to perform the operation in
          subdirectories as well. Recursion is enabled only if -R is
          specified; if -R is not specified, sets or modifies the
          permissions for the given directory only.

   <ace>
          [4]ACE Syntax defined using boolean expressions and
          sub-expressions.

   -readfile
   -writefile
   -executefile
          Specifies permissions (defined using ACE) for reading, writing,
          or executing the file.

   -readdir
   -lookupdir
          Specifies permissions (defined using ACE) for accessing the
          directory. To permit users to read files in the directory, grant
          the lookupdir access permission. To permit users to write to or
          execute files in the directory, grant the readdir and lookupdir
          access permissions.

   -addchild
   -deletechild
          Specifies permissions (defined using ACE) for adding or deleting
          subdirectories.

   -aces
          Specifies ACEs as a single string. Specify a comma-separated
          list of ACEs within quotes, up to 60 KB in length. You can set
          the following permissions.

   rf Refers to read file access.
   wf Refers to write file access
   ef Refers to execute file access
   rd Refers to read directory access.

   To write to or execute files in the directory, grant the user rd and ld
   permissions.
   ld Refers to lookup directory access.

   To read the files in the directory, grant the user ld access. To write
   to or execute files in the directory, grant the user both rd and ld
   permissions.
   ac Refers to add child directory access.
   dc Refers to delete child directory access.

   -preservemodebits
          Indicates whether to preserve or modify POSIX mode bits. Values
          can be:

          + true - preserve existing POSIX mode bits
          + false - change POSIX mode bits to match the given ACE setting

          The default value is false.

   -setinherit
          Indicates whether or not to allow all files and subdirectories
          under the specified directory to inherit the ACE of the parent
          directory. Values can be:

          + true - inherit ACE from parent
          + false - do not inherit ACE from parent

          The default value is true.

          If true, new files and directories under the parent
          directory,inherit the ACEs and corresponding POSIX mode bits
          from the parent directory.

          If false, files and directories under the parent directory do
          not inherit the ACE of the parent directory. Instead, by
          default, the files and directories get the default ACE, which is
          the empty string for all access types; POSIX mode bits are set
          on the files and directories in the traditional way.

   <path>
          Specifies the path to the file or directory.

   -setaudit on|off <dir|file|table> Enables auditing of the specified
   directory, file, or MapR Database table.

   Enabling auditing of a directory does not enable auditing of files and
   subdirectories that exist in the directory. You must enable auditing on
   those existing files and subdirectories. However, any new files and
   subdirectories that you create will automatically be enabled for
   auditing. See [5]Checking whether Auditing is Enabled.

   For operations on the object to be logged, auditing also needs to be
   enabled on the cluster and the volume in which the object is located.
   See [6]Managing Auditing for details. If auditing is enabled for a
   directory, new files and directories created within that directory are
   also enabled for auditing.
   -setchunksize <size> <dir> Sets the chunk size in bytes for the
   directory specified in <dir>. The <size> parameter must be a multiple
   of 65536.
   -setcompression on|off|lzf|lz4|zlib <dirtable> Turns compression on or
   off on the directory specified in <dir> or on the specified table, and
   sets the compression type to one of the following if compression is not
   turned off:
     * on — turns on compression using the default algorithm (LZ4)
     * lzf — turns on compression and sets the algorithm to LZF
     * lz4 — turns on compression and sets the algorithm to LZ4
     * zlib — turns on compression and sets the algorithm to ZLIB

   -setnetworkencryption on|off <target> Sets network encryption on or off
   for the file system object defined in <target>. The cluster encrypts
   network target to or from a file, directory, stream, or MapR table with
   network security enabled.
   -stat <path> Displays the statistics for the given file. Only the root
   user and the MAPR_USER user (user name under which MapR services run)
   have permissions to run this command.

   The path is required and specifies the path (to the file) on which to
   run the command. The output fields for this command are [7]as follows.
   tierstatus <file_path> [-v] The status of the offload or recall of the
   given file. If -v (for verbose) is also specified, for the given file,
   the command specifies whether data is local or offloaded as the final
   output. If the file:
     * Contains local data, returns the following final output:
File has local data
     * Is completely offloaded, returns the following final output:
File does not have local data

   See [8]Output for more information.

Output

   When used with the -ls, -lsd, -lso, -lsor, -lsr, or -lss options,
   hadoop mfs displays information about files and directories. For each
   file or directory hadoop mfs displays a line of basic information
   followed by lines listing the chunks that make up the file, in the
   following format:

   {mode} {compression} {encryption} {audit} {diskFlush} {replication}
   {owner} {group} {size} {date} {chunk size} {name} {chunk} {fid} {host}
   [{host}...] {chunk} {fid} {host} [{host}...] ...

   Volume links are displayed as follows:

   {mode} {compression} {encryption} {audit} {diskFlush} {replication}
   {owner} {group} {size} {date} {chunk size} {name} {chunk} {target
   volume name} {writability} {fid} -> {fid} [{host}...]

   The following table describes the values:

   CAPTION:

   mode

   A text string indicating the read, write, and execute permissions for
   the owner, group, and other permissions. See also [9]Managing
   Permissions.

   compression
     * U: uncompressed
     * L: LZf
     * Z (Uppercase): LZ4
     * z (Lowercase): ZLIB

   encryption         U: unencrypted; E: encrypted
   audit              U: disabled; A: enabled
   disk flush         U:disabled; F:enabled

   replication

   The replication factor of the file (directories display a dash instead)

   owner

   The owner of the file or directory

   group

   The group of the file of directory

   size

   The size of the file or directory

   date

   The date the file or directory was last modified

   chunk size

   The chunk size of the file or directory

   name

   The name of the file or directory

   chunk

   The chunk number. The first chunk is a primary chunk labeled "p", a 64K
   chunk containing the root of the file. Subsequent chunks are numbered
   in order.

   fid

   The chunk's file ID, which consists of three parts:
     * The ID of the container where the file is stored
     * The inode of the file within the container
     * An internal version number

   For volume links, the first fid is the chunk that stores the volume
   link itself; the fid after the arrow (->) is the first chunk in the
   target volume.

   host

   The host on which the chunk resides. When several hosts are listed, the
   first host is the first copy of the chunk, while subsequent hosts are
   replicas.

   target volume name

   The name of the volume pointed to by a volume link.

   writability

   Displays whether the volume is writable.

   When used with the -lsf <path>option, hadoop mfs displays only the file
   ID (fid) and the file name of each file in the path.

   When used with the -stat <path>option, hadoop mfs displays statistics
   for the given file. For each file, it displays the following:

   CAPTION:

   Output field Description
   uid The user ID of the owner.
   atime The last access time.
   mtime The last modified time.
   nlink The number of hard links.
   type The type of the file. Value can be one of:
     * regular
     * directory
     * symlink
     * vollink
     * kvstore
     * device

   size The size of the file or directory. Depending on the type of file,
   it can be the actual size or the number of entries.
   mode The UNIX style permission mode bits for the file/directory.
   networkencryption The network encryption setting. Determines whether
   network encryption is enabled for this file.
   subtype The subtype for the specified type. The following subtypes are
   supported for some of the types:

   regular

          + FSTRegBucket
          + FSTRegCF
          + FSTRegKeyMap

   kvstore

          + FSTKvTable
          + FSTKvTabletMap
          + FSTKvSchema
          + FSTKvTablet
          + FSTKvSegMap
          + FSTKvSpillMap
          + FSTKvKeyMap
          + FSTKvXattr

   device

          + FSTDevPipe
          + FSTDevSocket
          + FSTDevBlock
          + FSTDevChar

   For all other types, subtypes are not valid.
   gid The group ID.
   compression The compression setting.
   When used with [10]tierstatus, the output varies based on whether or
   not data is local, was offloaded, or was recalled. The output looks
   similar to the following if:
     * Data was completely offloaded:
File does not have local data
     * Data could not be completely offloaded or data was recalled:
File has local data

Examples

   View File Information

   The hadoop mfs command is used to view file contents. You can use this
   command to check if compression is turned off in a directory or mounted
   volume. For example,
# hadoop mfs -ls /

   In the above example, the letter Z indicates LZ4 compression on the
   directory; the letter U indicates that the directory is uncompressed.
   In the following example, the listed item is both uncompressed (first
   U) and unencrypted (second U).

            2050.35.393704      /tmp/hosts3

   Set ACEs

   Example 1: The following command shows how to set separate read, write,
   and execute permissions (using ACE) on a file:
hadoop mfs -setace -readfile p -writefile 'g:group1&!u:user1' -executefile p /fi
le

   When the command shown above runs, the POSIX mode bits for:
     * Read access is set for owner, owning group, and others.
     * Write access is set for none.
     * Execute access is set for owner, owning group, others.

   All other POSIX mode bits are set to 0.
   Example 2: The following command shows how to set read, write, and
   execute permissions (using ACE) as a single string on the specified
   directory and force all files and subdirectories under the specified
   directory to inherit the parent ACE. ACEs that are not specified will
   be set to the empty string.
hadoop mfs -setace -aces "rf:u:root,wf:group1&!user1,ef:p,rd:u:m7user1" -setinhe
rit true /dir

   When the command shown above runs, the POSIX mode bits for listing the
   contents (r) of the directory is set for owner/user and all other POSIX
   mode bits on the directory are set to 0; all new directories under this
   directory will inherit the parent POSIX mode bits. Also, new files in
   the directory will inherit the following POSIX mode bits:
     * Read access is set to owner/user.
     * Write access is set to none.
     * Execute access set for others.

   All other POSIX mode bits are set to 0.
   Example 3: The following command shows how to set permissions (using
   ACE) as a single string on the specified directory and all the files
   and subdirectories recursively.
hadoop mfs -setace -R -aces "rf:p,wf:g:group1&!u:user1,ef:p" -preservemodebits t
rue /dir

   When the command shown above runs, the POSIX mode bits are not modified
   to match the ACE setting.
   Example 4: The following command shows how to deny a specific type of
   access, writefile, which was set in the first example above, without
   removing all other access types associated with the file. The empty
   string used in the following example will deny write access to all
   users, roles, and groups.
hadoop mfs -setace -writefile "" -preservemodebits false /file

   When the command shown above runs, the POSIX mode bit for writing to
   the file is set to 0.

   Get ACEs
   The following command shows the ACEs and POSIX mode bits for the
   specified file only.
hadoop mfs -getace /m7user1/file1.txt

   Output
Path: /m7user1/file1.txt
  readfile: !u:m7user1
  writefile: !u:m7user1
  executefile: !u:m7user1
  mode: ---------

   Delete ACEs
   The following command deletes all ACEs associated with the specified
   file and sets the ACE for the file to the empty string.
hadoop mfs -delace /file

   The following command deletes all ACEs associated with the specified
   directory.
hadoop mfs -delace /dir

   The following command deletes all ACEs associated with the specified
   directory and ACEs associated with the files and directories
   (recursively) below the specified directory.
hadoop mfs -delace -R /dir

   Create a Hard Link to File
   The following command shows how to create a hard link to the file,
   file1, using a new name, file2.
# hadoop mfs -lnh /madvol1/file1 /madvol1/file2
Creating Hardlink: /madvol1/file2 -> /madvol1/file1

   Retrieve the Number of Hard Links
   The following command shows how to retrieve the number of hard links
   (and other statistics) associated with a given file.
# hadoop mfs -stat /vol1/file1
Path: /vol1/file1
