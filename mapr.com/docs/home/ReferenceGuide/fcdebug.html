fcdebug

   The fcdebug utility can be used to dynamically set the loglevel to
   debug a library.

   The core-site.xml file can be modified to set the loglevel of all
   modules using the fs.mapr.trace property. However, FUSE must be
   restarted for the change to take effect. The fcdebug utility allows you
   to debug a specific library (at runtime) without restarting FUSE.
   Note: You may have to run this command once per library (to debug).

Syntax

/opt/mapr/server/tools/fcdebug [-i] -s <shmid> [-m <module>] [-l <level>]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   -i Lists the current debug level of all modules.
   -l Specifies the log level. Value can be one of the following: FATAL,
   ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG.
   Note: If this is not specified, the default level is applied for the
   module.
   -m Refers to the module. The list of modules can be retrieved by
   running fcdebug -i -s <shmid> command.
   Note: If this is not specified, the loglevel is set on all modules.
   -s Specifies the process ID of the fileclient or FUSE-based POSIX
   client. If the process ID is not available, specify the ID of the
   shared memory segment, which has the size of 1234 bytes.

Examples

   The following command retrieves the list of modules:
/opt/mapr/server/tools/fcdebug -i -s 196614

   Note: You can run this command after dynamically setting the loglevel
   to also verify the setting.
   The following command dynamically sets the log level to DEBUG on the
   given module:
/opt/mapr/server/tools/fcdebug -s 196614 -m FuseOps -l DEBUG

   Note: It may take up to a minute for the changes to take effect.
   The following command sets loglevel to DEBUG on all the modules:
/opt/mapr/server/tools/fcdebug -s 196614 -l DEBUG

   The following command resets the log level to the default value on all
   the modules:
/opt/mapr/server/tools/fcdebug -s 196614
