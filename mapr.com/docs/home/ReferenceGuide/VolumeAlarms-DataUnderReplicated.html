Data Under-Replicated

   UI Column
          Replication Alarm

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_DATA_UNDER_REPLICATED

   Meaning
          The volume replication factor is lower than the desired
          replication factor set for the volume. This can be caused by
          failing disks or nodes, or the cluster may be running out of
          storage space.

   Resolution
          Investigate any nodes that are failing. You can see which nodes
          have failed by looking at the [1]Node Health pane in the
          Overview page in MCS. Determine whether it is necessary to add
          disks or nodes to the cluster. This alarm is generally raised
          when the nodes that store the volumes or replicas have not sent
          a heartbeat for five minutes. To prevent re-replication during
          normal maintenance procedures, MapR waits a specified interval
          (by default, one hour) before considering the node dead and
          re-replicating its data. You can control this interval by
          setting the cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec parameter using the
          config save command. For additional troubleshooting information,
          see [2]how to handle this alarm.
