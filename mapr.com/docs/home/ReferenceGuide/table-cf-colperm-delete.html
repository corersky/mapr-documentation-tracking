table cf colperm delete

   Deletes the Access Control Expressions (ACEs) for a specified column.
   Deletion cannot be undone.
   Note: When a user, group, or role requests to read data from, write
   data to, or append data to a column, MapR Database checks whether that
   user, group, or role has read or write permission for the column family
   AND read or write permission for the column. For example, suppose user
   i_montoya tries to write data to columns col1 and col2 in column family
   cf1. MapR Database checks whether i_montoya has write permission on cf1
   AND col1 AND col2. If i_montoya does not have all three permissions,
   MapR Database returns an error that says access for the write is
   denied.

   If this user were to try to read from the same two columns, MapR
   Database would simply not return the data. If the user tried to read
   from those two columns and additional columns on which he had read
   permissions, the results would contain the data for those additional
   columns but exclude the data for col1 and col2.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminaccessperm on the table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

   Parameter

   Description

   path

   The path to the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under volume1 which has
       a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/test

     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named test under volume1
       in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   cfname

   The name of the column family in which the column is located.
   name     The name of the column that you want to delete the ACEs for.

Example

   Deletes ACEs for column col1 in table mytable and column family cf1:

   CLI

maprcli table cf colperm delete -path /mytable -cfname cf1 -name col1

   REST

curl -k -X POST \
  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/cf/colperm/delete?path=%2Fmytable&cfname=c
f1&name=col1' \
  -u mapr:mapr
