MapR-DB Binary FormatResult

   Parses a sequence file generated by the DiffTables utility or the
   DiffTablesWithCrc utility and converts the results into a format that
   makes the results easier to understand.

Required Permissions

   The user that runs the FormatResult utility must have the readAce and
   writeAce permissions on the volumes where the input and output paths
   are located.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [1]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.FormatResult
-input <input file path>
-output <output file path>
[-mapreduce <true|false> (default: false)]

Parameters

   Parameters Description
   input

   The path to a file or directory of files that contains the output of
   either the DiffTables utility or the DiffTablesWithCrc utility.
   output The path to a file or a directory for the output. If the file or
   directory already exists, the utility fails. When a single sequence
   file is provided as input, the utility generates a single output file.
   When a directory of sequence files is provided as input, the utility
   generates a directory with output files.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the FormatResult operation. The default is not to
   use a MapReduce program (false).

Example

   Formats a sequence file:
[user@hostname ~]$ hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.FormatResult -input /
dif1/tf4/opsForDst/opsForDst-m-00001 -output /dif1/tf4/opsForDst_single/nomr -ma
