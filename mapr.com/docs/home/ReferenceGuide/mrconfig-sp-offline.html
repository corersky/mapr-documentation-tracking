mrconfig sp offline

   The mrconfig sp offline command takes a loaded storage pool offline.
   When a storage pool is offline it remains loaded into memory but it is
   not available to MapR-FS for reads and writes.

   The main use of the mrconfig sp offline command is to take a storage
   pool offline so the [1]fsck (filesystem check) command can be run on
   one or more disks or storage pools if there are lost or corrupt
   containers, directories, tables, files, filelets, or blocks.

   After running [2]fsck the storage pool is brought back online with the
   [3]mrconfig sp online command, and then typically the [4]gfsck (global
   filesystem check) command would be run on the affected cluster,
   volumes, or snapshots.

   See [5]mrconfig for instructions on running mrconfig commands.
