NFS Gateway Alarm

   UI Column
          NFS Service Down

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_NFS_DOWN

   Meaning
          The NFS service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether the NFS service is running. The warden will try
          three times to restart the service automatically. After an
          interval (30 minutes by default) the warden will again try three
          times to restart the service. The interval can be configured
          using the parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec in
          [2]warden.conf file. If the warden successfully restarts the NFS
          service, the alarm is cleared. If the warden is unable to
          restart the NFS service, see [3]more troubleshooting
          information.
