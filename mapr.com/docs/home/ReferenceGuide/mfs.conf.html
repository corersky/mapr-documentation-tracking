mfs.conf

   The configuration file /opt/mapr/conf/mfs.conf specifies the following
   parameters about the MapR Filesystem server on each node.
   Warning: You must restart the FileServer after making changes to this
   file.

Parameters

   Parameter

   Default Value

   Description
   mfs.server.ip   IP address of the FileServer. For example,
   192.168.10.10.
   mfs.server.port 5660 Port used for communication with the server
   mfs.cache.lru.sizes

   Version 4.0.1:inode:6:log:6:meta:10:dir:40:small:15

   Version 4.0.2 and later versions: inode:3:meta:6:small:27:dir:
   15:db:20:valc:3
   LRU cache configuration. See the section, Notes on LRU Cache
   Configuration, following this table.
   mfs.on.virtual.machine 0 Specifies whether MapR Filesystem is running
   on a virtual machine
   mfs.io.disk.timeout 60 Timeout, in seconds, after which a disk is
   considered failed and taken offline. This parameter can be increased to
   tolerate slow disks.
   mfs.max.disks 48 Maximum number of disks supported on a single node.
   mfs.max.logfile.size.in.mb 1000MB The maximum amount of disk space that
   the MFS logs can consume before the oldest log file is deleted; based
   on the following calculation:

   maxSizePerLogFile = maxLogSize / MAX_NUM_OF_LOG_FILES

   where
     * maxLogSize = total amount of space that MFS log files can consume
     * MAX_NUM_OF_LOG_FILES = total number of MFS log files

   mfs.subnets.whitelist   A list of subnets (up to 256 characters) that
   are allowed to make requests to the FileServer service and access data
   on the cluster.
   mfs.disk.iothrottle.count 100 The maximum number of outstanding
   requests on disk.
   Note: You can disable throttling by setting a high value. This is
   disabled if the value for mfs.disk.is.ssd is 1.

   mfs.disk.resynciothrottle.factor
   20

   The amount of time to wait before request is submitted to disk or sent
   over the network. Increasing the value will reduce the wait time and
   decreasing the value will increase the wait time. For example, setting
   the value to 40 will halve the wait time and setting the value to 10
   will double the wait time.
   mfs.network.resynciothrottle.factor 20 Controls the amount of time to
   wait before sending a resync operation over the network. Increasing the
   value will reduce the wait time and decreasing the value will increase
   the wait time. For example, setting the value to 40 will halve the wait
   time and setting the value to 10 will double the wait time.
   mfs.ssd.trim.enabled 0 Set this parameter to 1 to enable TRIM
   operations for SSD devices.
   Note: Enable TRIM only if it is recommended by the SSD vendor.
   mfs.disk.is.ssd 0 Specifies whether (1) or not (0) the drives are SSD.
   If 0, the drives are assumed to be rotations. The default value is 0.
   If the value is 1, the noop scheduler on the SSD is automatically
   enabled and IO throttling is disabled.
   mfs.mem.debug.enabled 0 Specifies whether fileserver should (1) or
   should not (0) track all memory allocations. The default value is 0. If
   value is 1, you can determine the root cause for high memory allocation
   or determine the component consuming most memory.
   mfs.numrpcthreads 2 Specifies the number of RPC threads per MFS
   instance. The valid range of values is from 1 to 4.

Example

mfs.server.ip=192.168.10.10
mfs.server.port=5660
mfs.cache.lru.sizes=inode:3:meta:6:small:27:dir:15:db:20:val:3
mfs.on.virtual.machine=0
mfs.io.disk.timeout=60
mfs.max.disks=48

   Notes on LRU Cache Configuration

   The cache values are expressed as percentages, which vary based on the
   expected size of the data the node is required to cache. The goal is to
   achieve a state in which most of the required data comes directly from
   the cache. You may need to tune the cache percentages based on your
   cluster configuration and the workload on specific nodes. Non-default
   allocations tend to work better for nodes that run only CLDB and nodes
   that do not have CLDB but do have a heavy MapR Database workload. Note
   the following recommendations.
     * For CLDB-only nodes, increase the size of the cache for Dir LRU to
       40%: change dir:15 to dir:40A CLDB-only node is a fileserver node
       that hosts only the CLDB volume mapr.cldb.internal (no user volume
       data is hosted on the node). Dir LRU is used to host B-tree pages.

     * For non-CLDB nodes with no MapR Database workload, optimize the
       cache to host as many file pages as possible. Change the value of
       the parameter to: inode:3:meta:6:small:27:dir:6

   The remainder of the cache will be used to cache file data pages.

   Note: You need to restart MFS in order for the change in mfs.conf to
   take effect.
