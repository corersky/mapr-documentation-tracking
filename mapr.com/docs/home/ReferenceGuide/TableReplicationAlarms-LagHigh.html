Table Replication Lag High

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_TABLE_REPL_LAG_HIGH

   Meaning
          These alarms display the paths and names of the source tables
          for which the replication lag is high. High lag times might be
          caused by these conditions:

          + High load on the source or replica
          + Low network bandwidth between the source and replicas
          + Miscellaneous error conditions that prevent replication from
            proceeding
          + Replication explicitly paused on the source cluster

   Configuration
          Configurable at the volume level. See [1]volume create for more
          information.
