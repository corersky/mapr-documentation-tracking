Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter                       Description
   path

   The path to the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under volume1 which has
       a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/test

     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   index     The name of the index for which to display information.

Example

   Lists the information for a table named mytable in the JSON format, as
   described in [3]Common Options:

   CLI

maprcli table info -path /mapr/my.cluster.com/volume1/mytable -json

   REST

curl -k -X GET \
  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/info?path=%2Fmapr%2Fmy.cluster.com%2Fvolum
e1%2Fmytable' \
  -u mapr:mapr

Output Fields

   CAPTION:

   Output Field

   Description

   path

   The path to the MapR Database table
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   numregions Number of regions in the table
   totallogicalsize Estimated size (in bytes) of uncompressed data stored
   in table (excluding replication)
   totalphysicalsize

   Estimated size (in bytes) of actual data stored in table (excluding
   replication).

   Includes internal metadata and reflects compressed data size when
   compression is enabled.
   totalcopypendingsize Total size (in bytes) of pending data for
   replication
   totalrows Estimated number of rows in a table
   autosplit

   A Boolean value that specifies whether to split the table into regions
   automatically as the table grows. The average size of each region is
   determined by the regionsizemb parameter.

   The default value is true. If value is set to false, you can manually
   split tables into regions by using the table region split command.
   bulkload

   A Boolean value that specifies whether to allow a full bulk load of the
   table. The default is false. For more information, see [4]Loading Data
   into Binary Tables and [5]Loading Documents into JSON Tables.
   tabletype Specifies whether the table will be a binary table or a JSON
   table. The values are binary and json. The default is binary.
   regionsizemb

   The average size of the regions into which MapR Database tries to split
   the table as the table grows. The default is 4096 MB. This value is
   ignored if autosplit is set to false.

   If autosplit is set to true, MapR Database splits a region when the
   size of the region exceeds 150% of the average value. For example, if
   the average value is 4096 MB, MapR Database splits a region that is
   larger than 6144 MB.

   Although splits are automatic, merges are not. For example, if the
   value of regionsizemb is changed from 8 GB to 4 GB, all regions that
   are eligible are split automatically, if autosplit is set to true.
   However, if the value of regionsizemb is changed from 2 GB to 4 GB,
   regions smaller than 4 GB are not automatically merged.
   Note: When a table has less than 4 regions, MapR Database ignores the
   regionsizemb parameter and splits regions at a lower threshold.
   audit Specifies whether to turn auditing on for the table. If auditing
   is also enabled at the cluster level with the maprcli audit data
   command and enabled for the current volume, setting this value to true
   causes auditing to start for the table.
   metricsinterval The table metrics collection interval, in seconds
   maxvalueszinmemindex The maximum value size to save in an in-memory
   index
   adminaccessperm The Access Control Expression that controls who can
   view and edit the permissions for this table. By default, permission is
   given to the user ID that is used to create the table.
   createrenamefamilyperm The Access Control Expression that controls who
   can create column families for this table or rename existing column
   families. By default, permission is given to the user ID that is used
   to create the table.
   bulkloadperm The Access Control Expression that controls who can load
   this table with bulk loads if the table was created with bulk load
   support. By default, permission is given to the user ID that is used to
   create the table.
   indexperm The secondary index Admin permissions setting that controls
   who can create an index associated with this table. By default,
   permission is given to the user ID that is used to create the table.
   packperm The Access Control Expression that controls who can pack table
   regions. By default, permission is given to the user ID that is used to
   create the table.
   deletefamilyperm The Access Control Expression that defines access to
   delete column families for this table. Delimit the expression with
   single-quotation marks. By default, permission is given to the user ID
   that is used to create the table.
   replperm The Access Control Expression that controls who can set up
   replication either to or from a table. By default, permission is given
   to the user ID that is used to create the table
   splitmergeperm

   The Access Control Expression that controls who can take the following
   actions:
     * Run the table region split and table region merge commands to split
       the table into regions or to merge regions of the table together.
     * Change the value of regionsizemb.

   By default, permission is given to the user ID that is used to create
   the table.
   defaultappendperm Applies to binary tables only: The default Access
   Control Expression for the append permission on new column families
   that are created in this table. If no value is specified, the default
   is u:<username of the table creator>. This value of the parameter
   appendperm in the table cf create and table cf edit commands overrides
   this value.
   defaultcompressionperm Applies to binary tables only: The default
   Access Control Expression for the compression permission on new column
   families that are created in this table. If no value is specified, the
   default is u:<username of the table creator>. This value of the
   parameter compressionperm in the table cf create and table cf edit
   commands overrides this value.

   defaultmemoryperm

   The default Access Control Expression for the memory permission on new
   column families that are created in this table. If no value is
   specified, the default is u:<username of the table creator>. This value
   of the parameter memoryperm in the table cf create and table cf edit
   commands overrides this value.
   defaultreadperm The default Access Control Expression for the read
   permission on new column families that are created in this table. If no
   value is specified, the default is u:<username of the table creator>.
   This value of the parameter readperm in the table cf create and table
   cf edit commands overrides this value. See [6]table cf create and
   [7]table cf edit
   defaulttraverseperm Applies to JSON tables only: The default Access
   Control Expression for the traverse permission on new column families.
   For more information about this permission, see [8]Permission Types for
   Fields and Column Families in JSON Tables.
   defaultwriteperm The default Access Control Expression for the write
   permission on new column families that are created in this table. If no
   value is specified, the default is u:<username of the table creator>.
   This value of the parameter writeperm in the table cf create and table
   cf edit commands overrides this value. See [9]table cf create and
   [10]table cf edit.
