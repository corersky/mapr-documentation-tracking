stream replica list

   Lists the replicas of a given stream.

Permissions Required on the Source Cluster

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce on the volume
     * [2]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm permission on the source stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this command unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI
maprcli stream replica list
         -path <stream path>
        [ -refreshnow <immediately refresh replication statistics> default: fals
e ]

   REST http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/stream/replica/list?path=<path>

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path The path and name of the stream that you want to list the replicas
   of.
   refreshnow A boolean value that specifies whether to trigger an
   immediate update of the replica statistics. The values are true or
   false. By default, the value is false and the command lists the current
   version of the replica statistics, which could be a maximum of five
   minutes old.

Data Fields

   CAPTION: Table 1.

   Data Fields Description
   cluster The cluster on which the replica stream resides.
   stream The path of the replica stream.
   type Identifies the type of table: MapR Database table or MapR Event
   Store For Apache Kafka stream.
   replicaPath The replica location of the source stream.
   replicaState The replication state indicates when stream replication is
   in progress and it also displays the status of operations related to
   replica autosetup with directcopy.
   paused A Boolean values that specifies if replication is paused.
   throttle A Boolean value that specifies if replication is throttled.
   idx The index number of the replica stream.
   networkencryption A Boolean value that specifies if replication is
   encrypted.
   synchronous A Boolean value that specifies whether replication is
   synchronous or asynchronous.
   networkcompression The type of on-wire compression.
   propagateExistingData Used to identify whether existing data in a CDC
   table is propagated to stream topic.
   isUptodate A Boolean value that specifies if the replica is up-to-date.
   minPendingTS The epoch time in milliseconds of the oldest message that
   has yet to be replicated.
   maxPendingTS The epoch time in milliseconds of the newest message that
   has yet to be replicated.
   bytesPending The number of bytes that have yet to be replicated.
   bucketsPending The number of buckets that have yet to be replicated.
   copyTableCompletionPercentage The percentage of data replication
   completed from the source stream to the destination stream.
   Note: When replicating MapR Database data, the
   copyTablePercentageCompletion data may re-adjust to a lower rate. This
   depends on table region (also referred to as tablets) splits and merges
   as well as the rate of incoming data to replicating data.
