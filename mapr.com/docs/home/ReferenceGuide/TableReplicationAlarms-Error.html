Table Replication Errors

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_TABLE_REPL_ERROR

   Meaning
          This alarm displays the paths and names of the source tables for
          which the alarms were issued. Up to ten (10) source tables, that
          have encountered an error, are displayed.

Diagnostics

   To identify the cause of the alarm, run the [1]maprcli table replica
   list command. This command displays an errors field with additional
   information about the error.
maprcli table replica list -path <table path>

   The errors field provides the following information:
     * Code - table replication error code:
     * Host - host that the error occurred on
     * Msg - error message information

   For additional information about possible causes of the error, see the
   following log files (located in the /opt/mapr/logs directory):
     * mfs.log-5 - for the nameserver node of the source table
     * mfs.log-5 - for the nameserver node of the destination table
     * gateway.log

Error Conditions

   CAPTION:

   Possible Error Conditions Description
   A missing table or column family on the destination cluster If a column
   family no longer exists in the replica, pause replication with the
   maprcli table replica pause command, recreate the column family with
   the maprcli table cf createcommand, run the CopyTable utility to copy
   data from the source table into the column family, and then resume
   replication with the maprcli table replica resume command.
   A mismatch in column family names for the table on the destination
   cluster

   If the column family still exists in the replica but the name of the
   column family was changed, run the maprcli table cf edit command with
   the parameter -newcfname set to the correct name. Replication will
   resume automatically.
   Unreachable gateways on the destination cluster This error occurs only
   if none of the gateways on the cluster are reachable.
   Autosetup with directcopy has failed while copying data from the source
   to the replica This error could be raised under the following
   conditions:
     * If this error occurs due to a connection failure, this alarm should
       get resolved once the connection is restored.
     * If this error occurs due to other error conditions such as missing
       tables, mis-matched column families, or an unreachable gateway, the
       error condition may not get resolved on its own and may need
       administration action. For example, if a PUT operation fails on
       destination cluster due to an Out-Of-Space condition, the
       administrator will need to add more storage before the PUT retry
       succeeds.
