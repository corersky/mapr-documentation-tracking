table region pack

   Manually triggers the packing of regions.

   MapR-DB automatically packs regions; however, you can use this command
   to reclaim space that is consumed by expired rows or to avoid read
   amplification.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * packperm permission on the table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table region pack
  -path <table path>
  -fid <fid>|all
  [ -nthreads <number of threads> ]

   REST

curl -k -X POST
  'http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/table/region/pack?path=<path>&fid=<fid>&<paramet
ers>'
  -u <username>:<password>

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path

   Specifies the path to the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, if you want to pack a table named test under
       volume1 which has a mount point at /volume1, specify the following
       path: /volume1/test

     * For a path on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, if you want to pack a table named
       customer under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the
       following path: /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   fid Specifies that you want to pack all table regions or a single table
   region that you identify with a FID. The output of maprcli [4]table
   region list lists the FIDs for the table.
   nthreads Specifies the number of threads allocated to process the
   packing of table regions. Default:16

Example

   Packs the specified region:

   CLI

maprcli table region pack -path /user/test5 -fid 2086.32.131296

   REST

curl -k -X POST \
  'https://myhost:8443/rest/table/region/pack?path=%2Fuser%2Ftest5&fid=2086.32.1
31296' \
  -u mapr:mapr
