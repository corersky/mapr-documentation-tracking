table region merge

   Merges regions of a table together to reduce the number of regions that
   a table occupies.

   This command merges the region that you specify with the region that
   contains the row keys that immediately follow the row keys of the
   specified region.
   Note: Consider the table configuration when you decide to merge regions
   because it is possible that MapR Database might immediately split the
   regions after they are merged. If autosplit is set to true, MapR
   Database splits a region when the size of the region exceeds 150% of
   the average value (regionsizemb). For example, if the average value is
   4096 MB, MapR Database splits a region that is larger than 6144 MB.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * splitmergeperm permission on the table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table region merge
  -fid <regionFID>
  -path <table path>

   REST

curl -k -X POST
  'http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/table/region/merge?fid=<region FID>&path=<path>'
  -u <username>:<password>

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description

   fid

   The FID for the table region that you want to merge. The output of
   maprcli [4]table region list lists the FIDs for the table.
   path

   The path to the table whose regions are being merged.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, if you want to merge regions for table named
       test under volume1 which has a mount point at /volume1, specify the
       following path: /volume1/test

     * For a path on a remote, you must also specify the cluster name in
       the path. For example, if you want to merge regions for table named
       test under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the
       following path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

Example

   Merges the specified region:

   CLI

maprcli table region merge -path /user/test5 -fid 2086.32.131296

   REST

curl -k -X POST \
  'https://myhost:8443/rest/table/region/merge?path=%2Fuser%2Ftest5&fid=2086.32.
131296' \
  -u mapr:mapr
