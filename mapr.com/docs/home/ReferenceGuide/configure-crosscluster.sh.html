configure-crosscluster.sh

   The configure-crosscluster.sh utility can be used to set up
   cross-cluster security between two clusters. When this utility is run
   with the create subcommand, it establishes the security between the
   local cluster and a remote cluster. After the setup, communication
   between the two clusters is bi-directional. This utility can be run on
   any node in the source cluster to grant secure access to users and/or
   servers (for replication, or mirroring purposes) on the destination
   cluster.

   When this utility is run, the utility prompts for the passwords for
   both the local and remote clusters. All hosts on a cluster must have
   the same password. If the password is omitted, ssh public key
   authentication must have been configured between this node and the
   other nodes in the local and remote clusters.

Prerequisites

   Before running this utility:
     * Enable wire-level security for both the local and remote clusters.
       That is, you must have secure=true in your cluster entry for
       /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf for both the local and remote
       clusters.
     * Install the pssh (Parallel SSH) package from EPEL.
     * Install the expect package.

   If you plan to use a user other than the mapr administrative user for
   mirroring or gateway/streams replication, that user must already exist.

Syntax

/opt/mapr/server/configure-crosscluster.sh create <cross-cluster-type>
    [ -localcrossclusteruser <user> ]
    [ -localhosts <path_to_file> ]
    [ -localport <port_number> ]
    [ -localuser <user> ]
    [ -recover <id> ]
    [ -remotecrossclusteruser <user> ]
    [ -remotehosts <port_number> ]
    -remoteip <ip_address>
    [ -remoteport <port_number> ]
    [ -remoteuser <user> ]

Arguments

   The <cross-cluster-type> argument specifies the type of entity for
   which cross-cluster access is to be established. Value can be one of
   the following:
   user For direct data access for the given user. When the utility is run
   with the user argument, it does the following on both the clusters:
    1. Updates the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file to include the
       first entry from the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file on the
       other cluster.
    2. Imports the other cluster's certificate in
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore file and copies the updated
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore file to all the other nodes on the
       cluster.

   server For MapR server access such as mirroring and replication. When
   the utility is run with the server argument, it does the following on
   both the clusters:
    1. Generates a cross-cluster ticket on this cluster for the other
       cluster and copies the ticket to the CLDB node on the other
       cluster.
    2. Merges the ticket with the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file on
       the node on the other cluster and copies the updated
       /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to all the other CLDB nodes on
       the other cluster.

   all For both user and server access. When the utility is run with the
   all argument, it does the following on both the clusters:
    1. Updates the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file to include the
       first entry from the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file on the
       other cluster.
    2. Imports the other cluster's certificate in
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore file and copies the updated
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore file to all the other nodes on the
       cluster.
    3. Generates a cross-cluster ticket for the other cluster, copies the
       ticket to the CLDB node on the other cluster, merges the ticket
       with the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file on the node in the
       other cluster, and copies the updated
       /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to all other CLDB nodes on the
       other cluster.

Options

   The following options are supported:
   Option Description
   localcrossclusteruser (Applicable for the server argument only) The
   name of the local cross-cluster user, if different from the local user,
   for mirroring and table/streams replication. The default value is the
   local user.
   localhosts The full or relative path to the file containing the list of
   IP addresses or hostnames of the hosts in the local cluster to update.
   Specify one host per line in the file, excluding the current host. If
   this is specified, the utility updates the configuration on the host,
   on which you are running the utility, and also the other nodes
   specified in the file. If this is not specified, the utility copies
   the:
     * Updated server security configuration in the
       /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to only the CLDB nodes in the
       local cluster.
     * Updated user security configuration in the
       /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file and
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_trustore file to all the nodes in the local
       cluster.

   localport The port to use to connect (ssh or scp) to local cluster
   hosts. The default value is 22.
   localuser The name of the user for the local cluster. The default value
   is mapr.
   recover The option to recover from failure to copy files to nodes in
   the local or remote cluster due to failed cluster nodes. Use the
   special ID keyword "latest" to run with the contents of the most recent
   run. See [1]Troubleshooting and Recovery for more information.
   remotecrossclusteruser (Applicable for the server argument only) The
   name of the remote cross-cluster user, if different from the remote
   user. The default value is the remote user.
   remotehosts The full or relative path to the file containing the list
   of IP addresses or hostnames of the hosts in the remote cluster to
   update. Specify one host per line in the file. If this is not
   specified, the utility copies the:
     * Updated server security configuration in the
       /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to only the CLDB nodes in the
       remote cluster.
     * Updated user security configuration in the
       /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file and
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_trustore file to all the nodes in the remote
       cluster.

   remoteip (Required) The host name or IP address of a host in the remote
   cluster.
   remoteport The port to use to connect (ssh or scp) to remote cluster
   hosts. The default value is 22.
   remoteuser The name of the user for the remote cluster. The default
   value is the the local user.

Verification

   To verify that cross-cluster security is correctly set up, do the
   following:
     * If you ran the script using the cross-cluster type user or all and
       the script completed successfully, you should be able to run remote
       commands from the local node after obtaining a user ticket using
       the [2]maprlogin utility. See [3]Configuring Secure Clusters for
       Running Commands Remotely for more information.
     * If you ran the script using the cross-cluster type server or all
       and the script completed successfully, you should be able to
       perform various service operations from local to remote cluster and
       vice versa, including mounting volumes over NFS, volume mirroring,
       and table and streams replication. See [4]Configuring Secure
       Clusters for Cross-Cluster Mirroring and Replication for more
       information.

Sample Session

   Run the utility on a CLDB host with wire-level security enabled to
   configure cross-cluster security:
# /opt/mapr/server/configure-crosscluster.sh create all -remoteip 10.10.30.96
Remote IP is 10.10.30.96

This script has logged in to both the local and remote clusters. Please log out
of
the clusters if needed.

Cleanup

   After running the utility, you must perform 2 cleanup actions:
    1. Log out of the local and remote clusters if needed using the
       maprlogin logout command.
    2. Delete the /tmp/mapr-xcs directory, if it is present, after
       verifying that the cross-cluster setup is correct.
       If run without the -recover option, the utility creates temporary
       files in /tmp/mapr-xcs directory under the current process ID.
       These directories contain sensitive information such as server
       tickets, protected by Unix permissions, and are not deleted by the
       utility in order to perform troubleshooting and recovery actions.
       After verifying that the cross-cluster setup is correct, delete
       this directory:
$ /bin/rm -rf /tmp/mapr-xcs

Post-Configuration Tasks

   After executing this utility, cross-cluster security should be
   successfully set up between the local and remote cluster. If you
   specified either user or all cross-cluster type when running the
   utility, to perform any operations on the remote cluster from the local
   node, login to the remote cluster to obtain a user ticket using the
   [5]maprlogin command.
$ maprlogin password -cluster <remote-cluster-name>

   Note: You must obtain a new ticket when your current ticket expires.
