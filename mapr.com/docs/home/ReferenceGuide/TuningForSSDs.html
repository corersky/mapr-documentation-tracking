Tuning for SSDs

   On servers with SSDs:
    1. Enable TRIM operation in the [1]mfs.conf file, if recommended by
       the SSD vendor.
       By default, TRIM is disabled. To enable, set the value for
       [2]mfs.ssd.trim.enabled to 1 in the [3]mfs.conf file. For example:
mfs.ssd.trim.enabled=1
    2. Create storage pool with multiple SSDs (so that the throughput is
       less than 2GB/sec).
       Note: Create one storage pool per SSD only if the device is
       high-end.
       To create, run disksetup:
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup -W <n> disks.txt
       For example, to create a storage pool with 2 SSDs, run the
       following command:
/opt/mapr/server/disksetup -W 2 disks.txt
       For more information, see [4]disksetup.
