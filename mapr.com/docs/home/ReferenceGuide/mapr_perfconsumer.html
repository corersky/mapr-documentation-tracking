mapr perfconsumer

   This utility runs a consumer reading messages from topics in a MapR
   stream. Use this utility to run consumers when you want to estimate the
   performance of consumers for your MapR-ES applications, given your
   network configuration.

   This utility works in conjuction with the mapr perfproducer utility.
   When starting this utility, you can specify how many topics to read
   from, how many partitions to read from in each topic, and how many
   messages to read.

   The mapr perfconsumer utility uses the default values for all of the
   configuration parameters that apply to consumers. For a list of these
   parameters, see [1]MapR-ES Configuration Parameters.

   The utility uses the default values for all of the configuration
   parameters that apply to consumers.

   Each consumer runs as a single thread. You can run multiple instances
   of the utility at the same time. However, because consumers can be
   CPU-intensive, it is recommended to run at most 4 or 5 on a single
   cluster node.

   When you run multiple instances of this utility, you can use the -group
   parameter to create consumer groups.

   Monitor the performance of the running instances of the mapr
   perfconsumer utility by following the instructions that are given in
   [2]Monitoring Consumers.

Prerequisites for running this utility

     * Ensure that there is a MapR stream that one or more instances of
       mapr perfproducer have already published messages to or are
       actively publishing messages to.
     * Ensure that the user ID that runs the mapr perfconsumer utility has
       the consumeperm permission on the stream.
     * Ensure that the user ID that runs the mapr perfconsumer utility has
       the readAce and writeAce permissions on the volume where the stream
       is located.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [3]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on streams, see
   [4]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

mapr perfconsumer
-path <stream-full-name>
[ -ntopics <num topics> (default: 2) ]
[ -npart <numpartitions per topic> (default: 4)
[ -nmsgs <num messages per topicfeed> (default: 100000) ]
[ -group <consumer group id> (default: null)
[ -topicsubscription <true/false> (default: false) ]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path The path to the stream.
   ntopics The number of topics for the consumer to subscribe to.

   The default is 2.

   If the number that you specify is greater than the number of topics
   that are in the stream, the utility hangs.
   npart The number of partitions to read from in each topic that is
   subscribed.

   The default is 4.

   If the number that you specify is greater than the number of partitions
   that are in each topic, the utility hangs.

   If you specify a group ID with the -group parameter, the consumer's
   committed cursors are saved.

   If you do not specify a group ID, then the consumer's committed cursors
   are not saved.
   If you use the -group parameter to specify a group ID and you set the
   -topicsubscription parameter to true:
     * If the consumer fails, it's partitions can be redistributed among
       other consumer in the same group. If the consumer is the only
       consumer within a group, restarting the consumer with the same
       group ID causes the consumer to begin reading from the offsets of
       the saved committed cursors.
     * If the consumer fails and is then restarted, it starts at the
       oldest message in each partition.

   nmsgs The number of messages to read from each partition.

   The default is 100,000.
   group The identifier of a consumer group. When two or more consumers
   belong to a consumer group, they must read from the same number of
   topics. MapR-ES distributes the partitions for those topics among the
   consumers in the group.

   The default is null.
   topicsubscription A vaue of true subscribes the consumer to topics. A
   value of false subscribes the consumer to topic partitions.

   The default is false.
