          VOLUME_ALARM_TABLE_LARGE_ROW_WARNING

   Meaning
          A row in a table within the specified volume has reached 75% of
          the maximum supported row size of 2 GB. The alarm provides the
          rowkey and the name of the table. If the rowsize exceeds 2 GB,
          subsequent MapR-DB operations on the corresponding table region
          will fail with an I/O error.

   Resolution
          Ensure that client applications that access the table are
          managing row data correctly, so that no row exceeds 2 GB. The
          method of resolving the alarm depends on the way in which client
          applications were managing row data.

          For example, if client applications allowed too many versions of
          cell data, delete excess versions. If client applications
          neglected to remove old columns or column families, remove those
          manually.
