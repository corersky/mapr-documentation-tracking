cluster gateway set

   Specifies the locations of the MapR gateways that a source MapR cluster
   can use for table replication to a destination MapR cluster or for
   indexing table data in an Elasticsearch cluster.

   In addition to this method, there are two other methods that you can
   use to specify the locations of gateways that a source MapR cluster can
   use when replicating to a particular MapR cluster or when indexing in
   an Elasticsearch cluster. See [1]Configuring Gateways for Table and
   Stream Replication for details about them.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway set
   -dstcluster <cluster name>
   -gateways <space-separated list of hostnames>
   [ -cluster <cluster on which command to be run> ]

   REST

http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/cluster/gateway/set?dstcluster=<path>&gateways=<lis
t of gateways>

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   dstcluster

   The name of the MapR cluster in which the gateways are located.

   If you are replicating table data to another MapR cluster, specify the
   name of that destination cluster. This destination cluster could be the
   source cluster if you are performing intracluster replication.

   If you are indexing table data in an Elasticsearch cluster, specify the
   name of the source MapR cluster because that is where the gateways are
   located.
   gateways A space-delimited list of gateway hostnames or IP addresses.
   Place double quotation marks around the list of gateways, as in this
   example: -gateways "gateway1 gateway2"
   cluster If you are not on the source MapR cluster, provide the name of
   that cluster.

Example

   This example specifies the hostnames of two gateways that are in the
   MapR cluster newyork . This command could be used in any of these
   situations:
     * The cluster newyork is the destination cluster for table
       replication from the source MapR cluster.
     * The cluster newyork is both a source and destination cluster for
       intracluster table replication.
     * The cluster newyork is a source MapR cluster that contains tables
       being indexed in one or more Elasticsearch clusters.

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway set -dstcluster newyork -gateways "gw1.bigcompany.com gw
2.bigcompany.com"
