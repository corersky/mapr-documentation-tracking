table upstream remove

   Un-registers a binary table as an upstream source for a replica.
   Note: This step is separate from the table replica remove command,
   which stops replication updates to a replica.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table upstream remove
  -path <table path>
  -upstream <upstream table path>

   REST

curl -k -X POST
  'http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/table/upstream/remove?path=<path>&upstream=<path
>'
  -u <username>:<password>

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path

   The path to the replica.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testdst under volume1 which
       has a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testdst

     * For a path on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customerdst under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   upstream

   The path to the source table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testsrc under volume1 which
       has a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testsrc

     * For a path on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customersrc under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customersrc

Example

   Removes company1src as the upstream source for replica company1dst:

   CLI

maprcli table upstream remove -path /volume2/company1dst -upstream /volume1/comp
any1src
