node allow-into-cluster

   Allows host IDs to join the cluster after duplicates have been
   resolved.

   When the CLDB detects duplicate nodes with the same host ID, all nodes
   with that host ID are removed from the cluster and prevented from
   joining it again. After making sure that all nodes have unique host
   IDs, you can use the node allow-into-cluster command to un-ban the host
   ID that was previously duplicated among several nodes.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli node allow-into-cluster
    [ -hostids <host IDs> ]
