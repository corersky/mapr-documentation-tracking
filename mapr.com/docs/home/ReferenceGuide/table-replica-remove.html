table replica remove

   Un-registers the specified MapR Database binary or JSON table as a
   replica.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on both the source volume and the target
       volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the paths of both tables
     * replperm permissions on the source table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

   After running this command, the specified table or index is no longer a
   replica of the source table and will no longer receive updates from the
   source table.

   In addition, run the table upstream remove command to remove the
   association between the source table and the replica table.

   CLI

maprcli table replica remove
  -path <table path>
  -replica <replica table path>

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   path

   The path to the source table that is being replicated.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testsrc under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testsrc
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customersrc under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customersrc

   replica

   The path to the replica.
     * For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
       mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under a volume
       with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testdst

     * For a table on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customerdst under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

Example

   Un-registers table custAdst as a replica of table custAsrc:

   CLI

maprcli table replica remove -path /volume1/custAsrc -replica /volume2/custAdst

   REST

curl -k -X POST \
  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/replica/remove?path=%2Fvolume1%2FcustAsrc&
replica=%2Fvolume2%2FcustAdst' \
  -u mapr:mapr
