cluster gateway resolve

   Lists the gateways configured on MapR cluster that are up and running
   at the time that the command is issued.

   Execute this command on a source MapR cluster to find out how many
   gateways are available for table replication to a destination MapR
   cluster or for indexing table data in an Elasticsearch cluster.

   This command uses the following criteria to get the list:
     * If the locations of the gateways were specified with the marpcli
       cluster gateway set command, the maprcli cluster gateway resolve
       command returns the list of the gateways.
     * If the locations of the gateways were specified with a DNS record
       only, this command performs a DNS lookup for gateways on the
       specified MapR cluster and returns the list that it finds.
     * If neither of the previous methods was used to specify the
       locations of the gateways, this command assumes that gateways are
       located on the CLDB nodes configured in the mapr-clusters.conf file
       on the MapR cluster where the command is executed.

   Note: Unresponsive gateways are not included in the list.

   For more information about gateways, see [1]MapR Gateways.

   Syntax

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway resolve
    -dstcluster <destination cluster name>
    [ -cluster <cluster on which command to be run> ]

   REST

http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/cluster/gateway/resolve?dstcluster=<clustername>

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   dstcluster

   The name of the cluster for which you want to list the available
   gateways.

   If you are replicating table data to another MapR cluster, specify the
   name of that destination cluster. This destination cluster can be the
   source cluster if you are performing intracluster replication.

   If you are indexing table data in an Elasticsearch cluster, specify the
   name of the source MapR cluster because that is where the gateways are
   located.
   cluster If you are not on the source MapR cluster, provide the name of
   the source cluster that this command should be run on.

Example

   This example shows that only one gateway is up and running on the MapR
   cluster cluster1. The IP address of this gateway was found in a DNS
   record, as indicated by the Source field.

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway resolve -dstcluster cluster1 -json
