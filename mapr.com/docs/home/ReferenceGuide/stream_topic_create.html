stream topic create

   Creates a topic in the specified stream.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * topicperm permission on the stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this command unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CAPTION:

   CLI
maprcli stream topic create
         -path <Stream Path>
         -topic <Topic Name>
        [ -partitions <Number of partitions> default: attribute defaultpartition
s on the stream ]
       [ -timestamptype Timestamp type: createtime | logappendtime default: crea
tetime ]

   REST
   http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/stream/topic/create?path=<path>&topic=<nam
   e>

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   path The path and name of the stream in which to create the topic.
   topic The name of the topic to create.

   A name can include alphanumeric characters and the period, underscore,
   and dash characters.
   partitions The number of partitions to use for the topic. After you
   create the topic, you can increase the number of partitions, but you
   cannot reduce the number. The default number of partitions for new
   topics is set by the defaultpartitions parameter in the commands
   maprcli stream create and maprcli stream edit.
   Important: A CDC changelog stream's default partitions can impact how
   many partitions a stream topic can have. This is because once you
   create a stream topic for a changelog stream, the number of topic
   partitions is locked. The number of topic partitions cannot change.
     * If the stream topic create command is used to create a stream
       topic, then the number of topic partitions can be set at creation
       time and then is locked.
     * If the [4]table changelog add command is used to add a stream topic
       (as well as establish a relationship between the source table and
       the changelog stream), then the number of topic partitions is
       inherited from the changelog stream and is locked.

   timestamptype Specifies the type of timestamp stored in the topic's
   message. Value: createtime | logappendtime Default: createtime. The
   topic inherits the default value from the stream unless the topic sets
   the timestamp type to a different value.

   A createtime value is the time defined by the user or application (when
   creating the message). If user or application does not define this
   value (or passes null), the client uses the current system timestamp.

   A logappendtime value is the time when the message (log) was appended
   to the server.
