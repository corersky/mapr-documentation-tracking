stream create

   Creates a new stream.
   After you create a stream, you can edit the values of its parameters
   with the command maprcli stream edit.

   To see the value of a stream's parameters, use the command maprcli
   stream info.

   To run this command, your user ID must have write permission on the
   directory in which you want to create a stream.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce and writeAce on the volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the path

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this command unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path The path and name of the stream to create.

   The path to the stream can include any character allowed by MapR. For
   example, /my/path/with:/to/mystream is valid, but
   /my/path/with:/to/mystream:withcolon is invalid.

   The name of the stream cannot include a colon ( : ) or a forward slash
   ( / ).
   ttl Specifies the number of seconds to elapse between the publication
   of a message in a topic in this stream and the expiration of that
   message.

   Consumers do not see messages that have expired.

   Messages that have expired are deleted during the next purge process.
   See [1]Time-to-Live for Messages for details.

   A value of 0 causes messages to be retained indefinitely.
   autocreate Specifies whether to create a topic automatically when a
   producer tries to write the first message to it. Values are true and
   false. The default is true.
   defaultpartitions Specifies the default number of partitions to
   allocate to new topics in the stream.
   compression

   Specifies the compression setting to use for the stream. Producer
   client libraries can bundle messages that are to be published on the
   same partition and compress them. The messages are sent to the server
   compressed, are stored compressed, are replicated to other containers
   compressed, and (if stream replication is configured) replicated to
   replica streams compressed. Consumer client libraries receive
   compressed data, decompresses it, and passes it to client applications.

   Valid options are off, lzf, lz4, and zlib. The default setting is the
   type of compression that is set for the directory in which the stream
   is located.

   For more information, see [2]Compression.
   produceperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who
   can publish messages to topics in the stream. See [3]ACE Syntax.
   consumeperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who
   can who can listen to topics in the stream. See [4]ACE Syntax.
   topicperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who can
   create, edit, or remove topics in the stream. See [5]ACE Syntax.
   copyperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who can
   use mapr copystream or mapr diffstreams on the stream. See [6]ACE
   Syntax.
   adminperm Specifies the access-control expression that controls who can
   can modify the other access-control expressions for the stream, set up
   replication from the stream, and modify attributes of the stream. See
   [7]ACE Syntax.

   This permission includes the topicperm permission.
   copymetafrom If you plan to replicate messages to this stream from
   another stream, specify the path to that other stream. The metadata
   from that stream will be copied to the new stream when the new stream
   is created.
   ischangelog Specifies whether the stream is for the Change Data Capture
   feature's changed data records. Value: true|false. Default: false.
     * If you want to use a non-default partition value (Default: 1) for
       the topic, use the maprcli stream create -path
       </mypath/stream:topic> -ischangelog true -defaultpartitions < value
       other than 1 > command to create the stream and then create the
       topic with the maprcli streams topic create command.
     * If you want to use the default partitions value (1) for the Change
       Data Capture feature, use the maprcli stream create -path
       </mypath/stream> -ischangelog true command to create the stream and
       then use the maprcli table changelog add -path <mypath/stream:topic
       command to set up the Change Data Capture feature and create the
       topic.

   defaulttimestamptype Specifies the type of timestamp stored in the
   topic's message. Value: createtime | logappendtime Default: createtime.
   The topic inherits the default value from the stream unless the topic
   sets the timestamp type to a different value.

   A createtime value is the time defined by the user or application (when
   creating the message). If user or application does not define this
   value (or passes null), the client uses the current system timestamp.

   A logappendtime value is the time when the message (log) was appended
   to the server.
   pidexpirysecs Specifies the expiration time for the Producer ID. This
   parameter fixes the lifetime for the Producer ID. Default: 604800
   mincompactionlag Sets the minimum delay (in milliseconds) before which
   messages are not compacted. It is the minimum time that the messages
   are available for consumption. Beyond this time period, the messages
   may be compacted. Default: 0

   The lag is calculated from the time that a message was produced to the
   stream topic-partition.
   Note: Compaction is set only when you edit the stream. See [8]stream
   edit.
   deleteretention Sets the minimum time (in milliseconds) before which
   deleted records are removed. It is the minimum time that the deleted
   records are still available. Beyone this time period, the deleted
   messages may be removed. Default: 86400000

   Used with log compaction.
