fid stat

   Displays statistics for MapR Database or file system components that
   are identified by an FID.

   Only the root user and the MAPR_USER user (user name under which MapR
   services runs) have permissions to run this command.
   Note: This command is similar to the UNIX stat command.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli fid stat
   [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
   -fid <file identifier for the element>

   REST
          N/A

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   cluster The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is
   omitted, the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.
   fid The file identifier for the element (region, kvstore, etc.) for
   which you want detailed information. The output of [1]maprcli table
   region list lists the FIDs for the table's regions.

Output Fields

   Columns Description
   uid The user ID of the owner.
   atime The last access time for this FID.
   nblocks The number of disk blocks.
   deleteFlags An internal delete flags set on the FID for transactions
   involving multiple nodes.
   mtime The time of the last modification.
   parent The parent FID.
   type The type of the FID. It can be for example, regular file, dir,
   filelet, kvstore, fidmap etc.
   version The current version of the FID.
   size The size of the FID. Depending on the type of FID, it can be the
   actual size or the number of entries.
   mode The UNIX style permission mode bits for the FID.
   networkencryption The network encryption setting. If the network
   encryption is enabled for this FID or not.
   subtype
