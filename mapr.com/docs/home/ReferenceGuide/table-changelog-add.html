table changelog add

Description

   Creates a changelog and creates a stream topic if one does not already
   exist. A changelog establishes a relationship between a MapR Database
   source table (JSON or binary) and a MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   stream topic.

Syntax

   CAPTION: Table 1.

   CLI
maprcli table changelog add -path <source table path> -changelog <destination st
ream path>:<topic name>

   REST
http://<ipaddress>:8443/rest/table/changelog/add?path=<source-table-path>&change
log=<destination stream path>:<topic name>

Parameters

   CAPTION: Table 2.

   Parameter Description
   path (Required) Path of the source table.
   changelog (Required) Target of the change log, specified as
   <stream_path>:<topic_name>, to which all change data records will be
   published. The stream must exist, otherwise, the command fails. If the
   topic does not already exist, maprcli table changelog add creates it.
   To propagate to an existing topic, specify -useexistingtopic.
   Note: The maprcli stream create command is used to create the changelog
   stream.
   Important: A CDC changelog stream's default partitions can impact how
   many partitions a stream topic can have. This is because once you
   create a stream topic for a changelog stream, the number of topic
   partitions is locked. The number of topic partitions cannot change.

   When using the table changelog add command to add a stream topic (as
   well as establish a relationship between the source table and the
   changelog stream), then the number of topic partitions is inherited
   from the changelog stream and is locked.
   useexistingtopic If true, allows propagation to an existing topic.
   Default: false.
   propagateexistingdata If true, initiates propagation of the existing
   data to the stream topic, otherwise, only new changes are propagated.
   Default: true
   columns For MapR Database JSON, a comma separated list of field paths
   to be propagated. For MapR Database Binary, a comma separated list of
   column family names, for example, <family>[:<column>] to be propagated.
   Default: All fields are propagated.
   throttle If true, data transfers to the specified sink are throttled.
   Default: false
   pause If true, pauses propagation after the changlog is created.
   Default: false
   synchronous If true, acknowledges the client writes to the table before
   the internal CDC gateway receives the data. Default: false
   networkencryption Specifies whether the data transfer between MapR file
   system and the internal gateway is encrypted. If true, data propagation
   is encrypted on-wire. Default: false
   networkcompression Specifies the compression scheme (off|lzf|lz4|zlib)
   of the data transfer on-wire. Default: lz4
