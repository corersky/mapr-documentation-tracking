Supported Commands for Hadoop 2.x

   MapR supports the following hadoop commands for Hadoop 2.x:

   Command

   Description

   [1]archive -archiveName NAME <src>* <dest>

   Creates a Hadoop archive, a file that contains other files. A Hadoop
   archive always has a .har extension.
   CLASSNAME

   The hadoop script can be used to invoke any class.

   hadoop CLASSNAME runs the class named CLASSNAME.

   [2]classpath

   Prints the class path needed to access the Hadoop JAR and the required
   libraries.

   [3]conf

   The hadoop conf command prints the configuration information for the
   current node.

   [4]daemonlog

   The hadoop daemonlog command may be used to get or set the log level of
   Hadoop daemons.

   [5]distcp <source> <destination>

   The hadoop distcp command is a tool for large inter- and intra-cluster
   copying. It uses MapReduce to effect its distribution, error handling
   and recovery, and reporting. It expands a list of files and directories
   into input to map tasks, each of which will copy a partition of the
   files specified in the source list.

   [6]fs

   The hadoop fs command runs a generic filesystem user client that
   interacts with the MapR filesystem (MapR-FS).

   [7]jar <jar>

   The hadoop jar command runs a JAR file. Users can bundle their
   MapReduce code in a JAR file and execute it using this command.

   [8]mfs

   The hadoop mfs command performs operations on directories in the
   cluster. The main purposes of hadoop mfs are to display directory
   information and contents, to create symbolic links, and to set
   compression and chunk size on a directory.

   [9]version

   The hadoop version command prints the Hadoop software version.
   Warning: For Hadoop2, some hadoop commands are deprecated and replaced
   by the mapred command.

   For example, if you run the hadoop job command, you see this message:
# hadoop job
DEPRECATED: Use of this script to execute mapred command is deprecated.
Instead, use the mapred command for it.

   The syntax for the mapred command is:
mapred [--config confdir] [--loglevel loglevel] COMMAND

   Commands used with mapred include:
      Command                      Description
   historyserver Runs job history servers as a standalone daemon
   hsadmin       The job history server admin interface
   job           Manipulates MapReduce applications
   pipes         Runs a pipes job
   queue         Gets information regarding JobQueues
