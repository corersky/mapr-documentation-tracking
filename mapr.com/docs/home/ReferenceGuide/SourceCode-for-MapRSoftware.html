Source Code for MapR Software

   MapR releases source code to the open-source community for enhancements
   that MapR has made to the Apache Hadoop project and other ecosystem
   components.

   MapR regularly releases updates to Apache Hadoop ecosystem projects as
   the projects are released by Apache, after MapR can verify that the
   changes do not impact product stability. Releases of ecosystem
   components are independent of the release cycle for the core MapR
   software, so that new updates can be released quickly and efficiently.

   Source code developed by MapR can be found on GitHub at
   [1]http://github.com/mapr as of March 2013, coincident with version
   2.1.2 of the MapR distribution. MapR may also release source code for
   other MapR projects at github.com/mapr. For each release that MapR
   includes in its distribution, MapR branches and tags the release on
   GitHub using the underlying project release number appended by -mapr.

Finding Source Changes Prior to February 2013

   GitHub is the single, central location for tracking changes that MapR
   applies to components in releases of the MapR distribution. Prior to
   February 2013, MapR included a list of patches in each component
   directory, as shown below. This information is no longer stored in the
   installation directory for recent releases, and instead is available at
   GitHub.

   February 2012
