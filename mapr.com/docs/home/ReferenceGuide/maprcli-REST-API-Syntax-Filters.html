Filters

   Describes the use of filters with MapR CLI commands.

   Some MapR CLI commands use filters, which let you specify large numbers
   of nodes or volumes by matching specified values in specified fields
   rather than by typing each name explicitly.

   Filters use the following format:
[<field><operator>"<value>"]<and>[<field><operator>"<value>"] ...

   field

   Field on which to filter. The [1]field depends on the command with
   which the filter is used.

   operator

   An operator for that field:
     * == - Exact match
     * != - Does not match
     * > - Greater than
     * < - Less than
     * >= - Greater than or equal to
     * <= - Less than or equal to

   value

   Value on which to filter. Wildcards (using *) are allowed for operators
   == and !=. There is a special value all that matches all values.

   You can use the wildcard (*) for partial matches. For example, you can
   display all volumes whose owner is root and whose name begins with test
   as follows:
maprcli volume list -filter [n=="test*"]and[on=="root"]

   Note: maprcli commands and REST APIs do not support OR conditions.
