Incorrect Topology Alarm

   UI Column
          CLDB Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_INCORRECT_TOPOLOGY_ALARM

   Meaning
          The mapr.cldb.internal volume's topology (normally /cldb) must
          include all CLDB nodes. This alarm signifies that one or more
          CLDB nodes are outside the CLDB volume's topology.

   Resolution
          There are two ways to resolve this alarm:

          + Move any stray CLDB nodes into the topology in which
            mapr.cldb.internal resides. See [1]Setting Up Volume Topology
            for more information.
          + Change the volume topology of mapr.cldb.internal to include
            the stray CLDB nodes. See [2]Administering Volumes for more
            information.
