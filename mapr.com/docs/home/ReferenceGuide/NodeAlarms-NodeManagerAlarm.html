NodeManager Alarm

   UI Column
          NodeManager Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_NODEMANAGER_DOWN

   Meaning
          The NodeManager service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether NodeManager is running. Warden will try three
          times to restart the service automatically ever 30 minutes (by
          default). This 30 minute interval can be reconfigured using the
          parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec in the [2]warden.conf
          file.

          If warden successfully restarts the NodeManager, the alarm is
          cleared. If warden is unable to restart the NodeManager, contact
          MapR technical support.
