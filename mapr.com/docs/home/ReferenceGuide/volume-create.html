Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description
   advisoryquota The advisory quota for the volume as integer plus unit.
   Example: quota=500G; Units: B, K, M, G, T, P
   ae The accounting entity that owns the volume.
   aetype The type of accounting entity:
     * 0=user
     * 1=group

   allowgrant Specifies whether a parent volume grants permission for a
   child volume to inherit its properties. True or false.

   Default: false.
   allowinherit Specifies whether a new volume inherits properties from
   the parent mount point volume. True or false. Default: true.
   auditenabled Specifies whether to turn on auditing for the volume. If
   auditing is also enabled at the cluster level with the maprcli audit
   data command, setting this value to true causes auditing to start for
   any directories, files, tables, or streams that are already enabled for
   auditing. If none are yet so enabled, auditing begins when you
   subsequently enabling auditing on any of them.

   Set auditenabled to true to enable auditing on directories, files,
   tables, and streams in the volume. You must have the fc permission on
   the cluster to use this parameter. See acl for details about this
   permission.
   autooffloadthresholdgb The size of the volume in GB (threshold). When
   this threshold is reached or exceeded, volume data is automatically
   offloaded by the Automatic Tiering Scheduler. To use the global size
   threshold (of 1024 GB), set the value for this parameter to 0.
   cluster The cluster on which to create the volume.
   [2]coalesce The interval of time during which READ, WRITE, or GETATTR
   operations on one file from one client IP address and UID/GID are
   logged only once for a particular operation, if auditing is enabled.

   For example, suppose that a client application reads a single file
   three times in 6 minutes, so that there is one read at 0 minutes,
   another at 3 minutes, and a final read at 6 minutes. If the coalesce
   interval is at least 6 minutes, then only the first read operation is
   logged. However, if the interval is between 4 minutes, then only the
   first and third read operations are logged. If the interval is 2
   minutes, all three read operations are logged.

   Now however, if the client was also writing to the file, irrespective
   of the coalesce interval for the read operation in the example stated
   previously, the write operation is logged, as it is a different
   operation from reading.

   The default value is 60 minutes. Setting this field to a larger number
   helps prevent audit logs from growing quickly.
   compactionoverheadthreshold Specifies the percentage of offloaded data
   that must be deleted from the MapR cluster to qualify for compaction
   (or deletion from the tier). The default value is 30%. Value must be
   less than 100.
   compactionschedule Specifies the schedule to use for running the
   compactor. By default, the compactor runs on an automatic internal
   schedule.
   containerallocationfactor Specifies the number of containers to create
   when the first write from a remote client is sent to the volume. The
   pre-created containers are distributed equally across topologies,
   servers, MapR Filesystem instances, and SPs. CLDB takes into
   consideration the load (IO/Space) when selecting target SPs for
   containers. Value must be a positive integer. The default value is 0.
   Value can be up to twice the number of SPs in the volumeâ€™s topology.

   If this is not set, when a volume is created, 5 containers are created
   for that volume when IOs are sent to the volume.
   createparent Specifies whether or not to create a parent directory to
   hold the volume link:
     * 0 = Do not create a parent directory.
     * 1 = Create a parent directory.

   criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec Timeout (in seconds) before
   re-replicating only the critically under-replicated containers. If both
   rereplicationtimeoutsec and criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec are set,
   and if the value of:
     * rereplicationtimeoutsec is less than
       criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec, then rereplicationtimeoutsec
       overrides criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec setting for both
       under-replicated and critically under-replicated containers.
     * rereplicationtimeoutsec is greater than
       criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec, then
       criticalrereplicationtimeoutsec overrides rereplicationtimeoutsec
       setting only for critically under-replicated containers;
       rereplicationtimeoutsec setting is still applicable for
       under-replicated containers.

   Default value for this parameter is 0 (which indicates no timeout).
   Value can be 0, or >= 300 seconds and <= 3600 seconds.
   dare Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to enable data-at-rest
   encryption for volume. This setting takes effect only if the
   data-at-rest encryption feature is also enabled at the cluster level.
   Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.
   dataauditops The comma separated list of filesystem operations to
   include (specified with a preceding plus sign (+)) or exclude
   (specified with a preceding minus sign (-)) from auditing.

   If the first operation in the list (of operations) is to be excluded
   from auditing, it must be preceded by two minus (--) signs. Subsequent
   operations to exclude must be preceded by only a single minus (-) sign,
   whether or not the first operation was included (using a plus (+) sign)
   or excluded (using two minus (--) signs). If neither sign is specified,
   the given operation is included for auditing.
   The operations that can be included (+) or excluded (-) from auditing
   are listed in [3]Auditing Data Access Operations. You can,
   alternatively, group all the operations using the keyword all, which:
     * If included (+), cannot be specified with a list of other included
       operations.
     * If excluded (-), cannot be specified with a list of other excluded
       operations.

   Other than the specified operations, by default, all other operations
   are:
     * Included for auditing if the specified list is a list of excluded
       operations.
     * Excluded from auditing if the specified list is a list of included
       operations.

   All specified operations must either be included or excluded from
   auditing. You cannot specify a mixed list of included and excluded
   operations.

   For more information, see [4]Selective Auditing of Filesystem and Table
   Operations.
   dbindexlagsecalarmthresh Specifies the threshold (in seconds) to raise
   an alarm for index update lag. Default: 0
   dbrepllagsecalarmthresh Specifies the threshold (in seconds) to raise
   an alarm for DB replication lag. Default: 0
   ecenable Enable (true) or disable (false) warm tiering for the volume.
   Either this parameter or tieringenable is required to enable warm
   tiering. If you specify this parameter, you cannot specify tiername;
   when the command runs, a new tier is created for the volume. If you do
   not specify any rule, the default rule, which is all files (p), is
   associated with the volume.
   ecscheme The number of data chunks and the number of global parity
   chunks separated by a plus sign (+). The default scheme is 4+2. For
   information on the supported schemes, see [5]Erasure Coding Scheme for
   Data Protection and Recovery.
   ectopology The topology of the erasure coded volume.
   enforceminreplicationforio Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to
   enforce minimum number of replicas for the (read-write) volume during
   IO. This parameter ensures that further updates (writes) to the volume
   are successful only when the minimum number of copies of the container
   are available. Setting this to true ensures that if writes succeed,
   then it has been applied to at least the minimum number of copies; if
   writes fail, it may have been applied to zero or more copies.

   Enabling this parameter, may stall volume dump and volume snapshot
   create operations, if the minimum number of copies of the container are
   not available.
   The default value is false.

   This parameter is ignored on Mirror Volumes. If there are more than
   five cluster nodes, this flag is set to true, by default, on the tier
   volume. If the number of cluster nodes is less than five, this flag is
   set to false, by default, on the tier volume.
   forceauditenable Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to force audit
   of operations on all files, tables, and streams in the volume, if
   auditing is enabled at the cluster and volume levels, irrespective of
   the audit setting on the individual directory, file, table, or stream.
   The value can be either:
     * true â€” force audit of all content
     * false â€” do not force audit

   By default, this parameter is disabled (false). To force audit of all
   directories, files, tables, and streams in the volume irrespective of
   the audit setting on the individual directory, file, table, or stream,
   you must set the auditenabled parameter to true.
   group Space-separated list of group:permission pairs. Use commas to
   separate permissions. For example: group:permission,permission,...
   inherit Specifies the name of the volume from which the new volume
   inherits properties. When inherit is explicitly specified, allowgrant
   is not required. See the following section on Inheritance for more
   information.
   localvolumehost The local volume host.
   localvolumeport The local volume port. Default: 5660
   maxinodesalarmthreshold The number of inodes, which when exceeded
   raises the [6]INODES_EXCEEDED alarm.
   maxnssizembalarmthreshold The namespace container size, which when
   exceeded raises the [7]INODES_EXCEEDED alarm.
   metricsenabled Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to enable
   metrics collection for a volume.
   minreplication The minimum replication level. Default: 2 When the
   replication factor falls below this minimum, re-replication occurs as
   aggressively as possible to restore the replication level. If any
   containers in the CLDB volume fall below the minimum replication
   factor, writes are disabled until aggressive re-replication restores
   the minimum level of replication.
   Tip: For more information, see [8]Understanding Replication.
   mirrorschedule The ID of a mirror schedule. If you specify a mirror
   schedule ID, then the mirror volume automatically syncs with its source
   volume on the specified schedule.
   mirrorthrottle Specifies whether throttling should be enabled at
   creation time.
   mount Specifies whether the volume is mounted at creation time.
   name The name for the volume. A volume name can contain alphanumeric
   characters and the following characters: . (dot), _ (underscore), and -
   (dash). For tiering-enabled volumes, the volume name cannot exceed
   ninety-eight characters.
   namecontainerdatathreshold Limits the size of the data stored in the
   name container. By default, the name container contains the first 64KB
   of each file along with metadata (attributes, and block information)
   about each file. The name container can grow very large with many
   files. For example, suppose there are 10 million files; 64KB of each
   file would result in a name container of 640GB. Enabling the name
   container size control feature reduces the size of the name container.
   Once the name container reaches the specified size, the first 64KB of
   each file is no longer placed in the name container; instead, once the
   limit is reached, all data is placed in data containers and only the
   metadata is stored in the name container. The value must be in MB. The
   default name container threshold is 512GB.

   If you set this parameter to 0, there is no limit on the size of the
   data stored in the name container.

   If chunk size is 0, by default, all data is stored in the name
   container. However, if this property is set, all data is stored in a
   second container and only the metadata is stored in the name container
   once the threshold is reached. The size of the second container is not
   limited by this setting; you must ensure that the size does not grow
   too large, by limiting the amount of data in the volume.
   nsminreplication The minimum replication level for the namespace
   container. Default: 2. When the replication factor falls below this
   minimum, re-replication occurs as aggressively as possible to restore
   the replication level. If any containers in the CLDB volume fall below
   the minimum replication factor, writes are disabled until aggressive
   re-replication restores the minimum level of replication. When enabled,
   the CLDB manages the namespace container replication separate from the
   data container replication. Use this capability when you have low
   volume replication but want to have higher namespace replication.

   This parameter must be the same or larger than the equivalent data
   replication parameter, minreplication.
   For more information, see [9]Understanding Replication.
   nsreplication The desired namespace container replication level.
   Default: 3. When the number of copies falls below the desired
   replication factor, but remains equal to or above the minimum
   replication factor, re-replication occurs after the timeout specified
   in the cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec parameter. This timeout is the time
   given for a node that is offline to come back online. After this
   timeout period, the CLDB takes action to restore the replication
   factor. When enabled, the CLDB manages the namespace container
   replication separate from the data container replication. Use this
   capability when you have low volume replication but want to have higher
   namespace replication.

   By default, the value of this parameter is the same or larger than the
   value of the equivalent data replication parameter, replication.
   However, to set the value of this parameter lower than the replication
   value, first set engg.manual.override to true in cldb.conf.
   For more information, see [10]Understanding Replication.
   offloadschedule The ID of the schedule to associate with the volume for
   offloading volume data to the tier. To disable schedule-based offload,
   set the value to 0.
   path The path at which to mount the volume. The path must be relative
   to / and cannot be in the form of a global namespace path (for example,
   /mapr/<cluster-name>/).
   quota The quota for the volume as integer plus unit. Example:
   quota=500G; Units: B, K, M, G, T, P

   Do not use two-letter abbreviations for quota units, such as GB and MB.

   When you set a quota for a tiering-enabled volume, the quota is the
   total space allocated for the volume irrespective of the location
   (cluster or tier) where the volume data is stored. For example, if you
   allocate 1GB of hard quota for a tiering-enabled volume, writes fail
   after you write 1GB of data whether or not the volume data is local (on
   the cluster) or offloaded (to the tier)
   readAce Specifies [11]Access Control Expressions (ACEs) that grants
   permissions at the volume level to read files and tables in the volume.
   The default value is p, which grants access to all users.

   An ACE (up to 2KB in length) is a combination of users, groups, or
   roles for whom access to volume data is defined using boolean
   expressions and subexpressions within single quotes. There is no change
   to access types that are not passed in with the command.
   readonly Specifies whether or not the volume is read-only:
     * 0 = Volume is read/write.
     * 1 = Volume is read-only.

   recallexpirytime The amount of time to keep the recalled data before
   offloading it again. Value must be greater than 1 and lesser than 7500.
   The default value is 1 day.
   replication The desired replication level. Default: 3. When the number
   of copies falls below the desired replication factor, but remains equal
   to or above the minimum replication factor, re-replication occurs after
   the timeout specified in the cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec parameter.
   Note that this timeout is the time given for a node that is offline to
   come back online. After this timeout period, the CLDB takes action to
   restore the replication factor.
   Tip: For more information, see [12]Understanding Replication.
   replicationtype The desired replication type. You can specify
   low_latency (star replication) or high_throughput (chain replication).
   The default setting is high_throughput.
   rereplicationtimeoutsec Timeout (in seconds) before attempting
   re-replication of replica containers. This volume property defines the
   timeout period until CLDB starts re-replicating the containers on the
   node of the volume when CLDB stops receiving a heartbeat from the node.

   When a node is down, CLDB gives the node an hour to come back online
   before it takes any action for the containers on this node. This
   parameter can be set on volumes to reduce the default 1 hour to a
   shorter time period. This option is provided mainly for local volumes,
   so that when a MapR Filesystem is down, CLDB can give up quickly and
   decide that the container has no master. This forces the NodeManager
   (NM) to give up on local containers and take the appropriate recovery
   action of deleting the mapred volume and creating another one.
   rootdirgroup Group that owns the root directory.
   rootdirperms Permissions on the volume root directory.
   rootdiruser User that owns the root directory.
   schedule The ID of a schedule. Use the [13]schedule list command to
   find the ID of the named schedule that you want to apply to the volume.

   In 4.0.1, when you provide a schedule ID, the ID applies to a mirror
   volume. The mirror volume automatically syncs with its source volume on
   the specified schedule. Use the schedule list command to find the ID of
   the named schedule that you wish to apply to the volume.

   In 4.0.2 and later releases, when you provide a schedule ID, the ID
   applies to either a mirror volume or a standard volume. A standard
   volume automatically creates snapshots on the specified schedule. A
   mirror volume syncs with its source volume on the specified schedule.
   If a mirror volume is made into a standard volume, the -schedule option
   is used as the snapshot schedule for the standard volume.
   skipinherit Specifies not to inherit given properties associated with
   the:
     * Parent volume (for other volumes)
     * Source volume (for mirror volumes)

   Value must be the following keyword:
     * schedule to not inherit snapshot schedule settings
     * tiername to not:
          + Inherit tiering properties like tierid, tieroffloadscheduleid,
            ecshceme, ectopology
          + Set default values for compactionscheduleid and
            compactionoverheadthreshold

   Use comma to separate multiple values.
   source For mirror volumes, the source volume to mirror, in the format
   <source volume>@<cluster> (Required when creating a mirror volume).
   tenantuser The username of the tenant for whom the volume is being
   created.
   tierencryption Specifies whether (true) or not (false) data on the
   object store should be encrypted. If true, user data is encrypted
   before being written to the object. This parameter is applicable only
   for a cold tier, and can be set only if a tier name is also specified.
   Once set, you cannot modify this parameter.

   If true, you can also specify a custom key using the tierkey parameter.
   The default value is false.
   Tip: For creating a warm-tier volume, use the -dare option on the
   front-end volume to enable or disable encryption of data-at-rest.
   tieringenable Enable (true) or disable (false) tiering for the volume.
   When you specify this parameter, you must also specify the tiername.
   For creating a tiering-enabled mirror volume, specify this parameter if
   the source volume is enabled for cold-tier; specify either this
   parameter or ecenable, if the source volume is enabled for warm-tier.
   tieringrule The name of the rule (referred to as storage policy in MCS)
   to use for offloading data to the tier. If you do not specify a rule,
   the default rule, which is all files (p), is associated with the
   volume. See Creating a Rule in [14]Creating a Storage Policy for more
   information.
   tierkey The 32 character HEX string to use for encryption, only for
   cold-tier operations. If you do not specify this parameter, CLDB
   generates a 32 character HEX string to use for encrypting data to
   offload to the tier.
   tiername The name of the tier to use for offloading data. This can be
   set only once and cannot be modified thereafter. For warm tiering, you
   cannot specify this parameter if ecenable is set to true.
   topology The rack path to the volume.
   To create a volume in a specific topology, you must have the
   [15]Converged Enterprise Edition installed on your system. Without the
   Converged Enterprise Edition, when you run the maprcli volume create
   command with the -topology option, the following error message is
   returned:
ERROR (10010) -  Volume Creation Failed: Setting topology on
a volume requires data placement feature. License not found for data placement.

   type The type of volume to create.

   The following values are accepted:
     * mirror - standard mirror (read-only) volume (promotable to standard
       read-write volume)
     * rw - standard (read-write) volume (convertible to standard mirror
       volume)
     * 0 - standard (read-write) volume (for backward compatibility)
     * 1 - non-convertible mirror (read-only) volume (for backward
       compatibility)

   user Space-separated list of user:permission pairs. Use comma to
   separate permissions. For example: user:permission,permission,...
   wiresecurityenabled Enables (true) or disables (false) on-wire
   encryption for all files, tables, and streams in the volume on secure
   clusters. This parameter is not supported on insecure clusters. By
   default, this parameter is enabled (true) for volumes on secure
   clusters. If true, this setting overrides all file, table, and stream
   level encryption settings (set using hadoop mfs command) and enables
   on-wire encryption for all files, tables, and streams. If this is
   disabled (false) at the volume level and is enabled at the file, table,
   and/or stream level, the file, table, and/or stream level encryption
   setting overrides this setting on those files, tables, and streams
   where it is enabled; for all other files, tables, and streams where
   encryption is not enabled at the file, table, and/or stream level,
   on-wire encryption is disabled.
   writeaAce Specifies [16]Access Control Expressions (ACEs) that grants
   permission at the volume level to write to files and tables in the
   volume. The default value is p, which grants access to all users.

   An ACE (up to 2KB in length) is a combination of users, groups, and/or
   roles for whom access (to volume data) is defined using boolean
   expressions and sub expressions within single quotes.

Inheritance

   The following table shows the list of inheritable parameters that are
   (Yes) and are not (No) inherited by a:
     * Mirror volume from the source volume on the same cluster
     * Mirror volume from the source volume on a different cluster

   Note: All (non-mirror) volumes inherit all the inheritable properties
   from the parent volume. For more information on the properties, refer
   to volume create [17]parameters.

   Create volumes that inherit from a parent volume

   When creating and mounting a volume, the location of the mount path is
   specified by the path parameter. Volumes can be mounted via the web
   console, the maprcli commands, or the REST commands. The maprcli
   commands include volume create -path command and the maprcli volume
   mount -path command if the volume was previously created. Sub-volumes
   (children) can inherit properties from their parent volume.

   In the following example, a parent volume and two (2) child volumes are
   create where the child volume inherit properties from the parent. When
   the inherit flag is explicitly used, the allowgrant parameter for the
   parent volume is not required.
     * For child volumes, c1 and c2, inheritance is explicit because the
       inherit option is specified. Thus, p1.c1 and p1.c2 volumes will
       inherit all properties from volume p1 (note that p1 is not a parent
       of p1.c1) regardless of whether the allowgrant option is set on p1
       or not. In this case, there is an explicit inheritance ant the
       allowgrant flag is ignored and volume properties are inherited.
     * For the child volume, c3, inheritance is implicit. Meaning, the
       child volume, p1.c3, inherits all properties from the parent
       volume, p1, only if the allowgrant option is set on p1.

     * [24]CLI
     * [25]REST

/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli volume create -name p1 -path /p1
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli volume create -name p1.c1 -inherit p1
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli volume create -name p1.c2 -path /p1/c2 -inherit p1
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli volume create -name p1.c3 -path /p1/c3

curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/volume/create?name=p1.c3&path=%2Fp1
%2Fc3' --user mapr:mapr

   In the following example, the p1.child volume normally inherits from
   the p1 parent volume properties because p1.child is mounted under p1
   and allowgrant option is set to true on the parent volume. However, if
   the child volume doesn't want to inherit properties, then set the
   allowinherit option to false (default: true).
