cluster gateway delete

   Deletes the list of MapR gateways from a source MapR cluster.

   Source MapR clusters can use such lists to locate the gateways that
   enable replication of table data to a particular MapR cluster or
   indexing of table data in a particular Elasticsearch cluster. You
   create lists of gateways by running the maprcli cluster gateway set
   command.

   There are three methods of specifying the location of gateways to a
   MapR cluster that is a source for table replication or indexing in
   Elasticsearch. If a source MapR cluster relies on DNS records to find
   out where gateways are located, or the cluster relies on the
   mapr-clusters.conf file to locate gateways, there is no list for the
   cluster gateway delete command to delete.
   Note: Deleting a list of gateways with the maprcli cluster gateway
   delete command does not uninstall the listed gateways from the MapR
   cluster where they are located.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway delete
   -dstcluster <cluster name>
   [ -cluster <cluster on which command to be run> ]

   REST

http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/cluster/gateway/delete?dstcluster=<path>

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   dstcluster

   The name of the cluster on which the gateways are located.

   If you are replicating table data to another MapR cluster, specify the
   name of that destination cluster. This destination cluster could be the
   source cluster if you are performing intracluster replication.

   If you are indexing table data in an Elasticsearch cluster, specify the
   name of the source MapR cluster because that is where the gateways are
   located.
   cluster If you are not on the source cluster, provide the name of the
   source cluster that this command should be run on,

Example

   Deletes a list of gateways that is stored on a source MapR cluster. The
   gateways are being used for table replication and are located in the
   destination MapR cluster newyork.

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway delete -dstcluster newyork
