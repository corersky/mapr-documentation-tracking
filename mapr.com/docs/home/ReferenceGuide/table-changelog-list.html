Output Data Fields

   The following fields display for each replica.
   Field Description
   cluster The cluster on which the replica resides.
   changelog Identifies the destination stream topic for the changelog.
   changelogstream Identifies the destination stream for the changelog.
   replicaState The replication state. For information about the
   replication states, see [1]Table Replication States.
   paused A Boolean values that specifies if replication is paused.
   throttle A Boolean value that specifies if replication is throttled.
   idx The internal index value.
   networkencryption A Boolean value that specifies if replication is
   encrypted.
   synchronous A Boolean value that specifies whether replication is
   synchronous or asynchronous.
   networkcompression The type of on-wire compression.
   propagateExistingData Identifies whether existing data in the source
   table is propagated to the destination stream topic.
   isUptodate A Boolean value that specifies if the replica is up-to-date.
   minPendingTS The epoch time in milliseconds of the oldest operation
   that has yet to be replicated to the replica.
   maxPendingTS The epoch time in milliseconds of the newest operation
   that has yet to be replicated to the replica.
   bytesPending The number of bytes that have yet to be replicated to the
   replica.
   putsPending The number of puts that have yet to be replicated to the
   replica.
   bucketsPending The number of buckets that have yet to be replicated to
   the replica.
   uuid The table UUID.
   copyTableCompletionPercentage When propagation of existing data is in
   progress, this value is the percentage of data from the source table
   that has been propagated to the destination stream topic.
   Note: When replicating MapR-DB data, the copyTablePercentageCompletion
   data may re-adjust to a lower rate. This depends on table region (also
   referred to as tablets) splits and merges as well as the rate of
   incoming data to replicating data.
   errors If applicable, an error is displayed.
