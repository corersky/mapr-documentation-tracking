   Lists the regions that make up a specified table or index.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce on the volume
     * [2]lookupdir on directories in the path

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table region list
  -path <path>
  [ -start <offset from starting region> ]
  [ -limit <number of regions to return> ]
  [ -index <index name> ]
  [ -output terse | verbose ]

   REST

curl -k -X GET \
  'http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/table/region/list?path=<path>&<parameters>'
  -u <username>:<password>

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description

   path

   Path to the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, if you want to list regions for a table named
       test under volume1 which has a mount point at /volume1, specify the
       following path: /volume1/test

     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, if you want to list regions for a
       table named test under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify
       the following path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   start

   The offset from the starting region. The default value is 0.

   limit

   The number of regions to return, counting from the starting region. The
   default value is 2147483647.
   index The name of the index for which to list region information.
   output Specifies whether the output should be terse or verbose.

   Default: verbose

Output Fields

   CAPTION:

   Verbose Field Name Terse Field Name Field Value
   primarymfs pn Host name and port of the primary node for this region
   secondarymfs sn Host names and ports of the secondary nodes where this
   region is replicated
   startkey sk Value of the start key for this region

   For the first region in a table, this value is exclusive. For all other
   regions, it is inclusive. See the example output.
   endkey ek Value of the end key for this region

   This value is always exclusive. See the example output.
   lastheartbeat lhb Time since last heartbeat from the region's primary
   node
   fid fid The region's FID.
   logicalsize ls The logical size (in bytes) of the region without data
   compression (excluding replication).
   physicalsize ps The physical size (in bytes) of the region with data
   compression (excluding replication).
   copypendingsize cps Amount of data remaining to be replicated
   numberofrows nr Number of rows in the region
   numberofrowswithdelete nrd Number of rows in the region, counting
   deleted rows
   numberofspills nsp Number of spills for the region
   numberofsegments nsg Number of segments in the region

Examples

   Lists the Region Information for a Table

   This example lists the region information for the table newtable.

   CLI

maprcli table region list -path /my.cluster.com/volume1/newtable

   REST

curl -k -X GET \
  'https://r1n1.sj.us:8443/rest/table/region/list?path=%2Fmy.cluster.com%2Fvolum
e1%2Fnewtable' \
  -u mapr:mapr

   Example Output Using the -json Option

   This example shows two table regions. The value of endkey for the first
   region is the value of startkey for the second region. The value of
   endkey is always exclusive. So, for the first region, endkey shows that
   the first region was split with the addition of the record with the key
   5190414F2E44DB732547630A9A81452539749000; for the second region,
   startkey shows that the region begins with that record.
