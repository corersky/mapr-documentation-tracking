   Meaning
          The number of SPs or nodes that are offline or down exceed the
          number of parity fragments set for the tiering-enabled volume.
          MapR only tolerates failure of nodes equal to the number of
          parity fragments set for the tiering-enabled volume.

   Resolution
          Add more nodes to the topology or cluster.
