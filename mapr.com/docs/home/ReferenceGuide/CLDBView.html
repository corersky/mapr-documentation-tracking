Viewing CLDB Information

   The CLDB page provides information about the Container Location
   Database (CLDB). The CLDB is a management service that tracks container
   locations and the root of volumes.
   To display the CLDB information page, log in to the MapR Control System
   and go to the [1]service information page for CLDB. Alternatively, you
   can use the following links to access the CLDB page:
     * For a secure cluster, access the CLDB view at
       https://<cldbmaster>:7443/cldb.jsp.
     * For an non-secure cluster, access the CLDB view at
       http://<cldbmaster>:7221/cldb.jsp.

   The following table describes the CLDB page:
