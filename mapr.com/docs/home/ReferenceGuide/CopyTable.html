MapR-DB Binary CopyTable

   Copies data from one MapR-DB binary table to another MapR-DB binary
   table.
   The MapR-DB CopyTable utility is different from Apache HBase's
   [1]CopyTable utility. This utility has the following capability:
     * If the destination table does not exist, CopyTable creates the
       target table with the same metadata (column families and access
       control expressions) as the source table, and then copies data.
     * If the destination table exists, CopyTable copies data only.
     * If you manually set up replication to a MapR-DB table, CopyTable
       can be used to perform an initial load of source data to the
       replica before table replication begins.

   Note: When copying data to MapR-DB tables, it is recommended that you
   use the MapR-DB version of CopyTable.

Required Permissions

   The user that runs the CopyTable utility must have the following
   permissions:
     * The permission readAce on the volume where the source table is
       located, and the permission writeAce on the volume where the
       destination table is or will be located.
     * The permission adminperm on the source table.
     * The permission for column-family and column reads (readperm) on the
       data in the source table that you want to copy.
     * When bulkload = false, the permission for column writes (writeperm)
       on the destination table.
     * When bulkload = true (default), the permission to load the
       destination table with bulk loads (bulkloadperm).
     * If the destination table does not yet exist: createrenamefamily on
       the source table.

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

   If CopyTable is run between tables on different clusters, the user that
   runs the command must have the required permissions on each cluster.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [2]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on tables, see [3]Enabling
   Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.

Syntax

hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.CopyTable
    -src <source table path> -dst <destination table path>
    [-columns cf1[:col1],...] [-maxversions <max number of versions to copy>]
    [-starttime <time>]
    [-endtime <time>]
    [-mapreduce <true|false> (default: true)]
    [-bulkload <true|false> (default: true)]
    [-numthreads <numThreads> (default:16, valid only when -mapreduce is false)]

Parameters

   Parameters Description
   src

   The path to the source table that you want to replicate.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testsrc under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testsrc
     * For a path on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customersrc under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customersrc

   dst

   The path to the replica.
     * For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
       mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under a volume
       with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testdst
     * For a table on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customerdst under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   columns By default, all columns in the source table are copied. If you
   do not want to copy all columns in the table, you can specify columns
   to copy. Provide a comma-separated list of column families or columns
   from a certain column family (column family:qualifier).

   For example, use the following syntax to copy only the purchases column
   family and the stars column in the reviews column family: -columns
   purchases,reviews:stars
   maxversions By default, all versions from the source table are copied.
   If you do not want to copy all versions, use this parameter to specify
   the number of versions to copy.
   starttime By default, all table values regardless of their associated
   timestamp are copied. You can specify a timestamp to indicate the table
   cell version at which to start the copy. The timestamp is a long
   integer value that is either user-defined or system-defined (epoch in
   milliseconds). Values with timestamps lower than the specified
   timestamp will not be copied to the destination.
   endtime By default, all table values regardless of their associated
   timestamp are copied. You can specify a timestamp to indicate the table
   cell version at which to end the copy. The timestamp is a long integer
   value that is either user-defined or system-defined (epoch in
   milliseconds). Values with timestamps greater than or equal to the
   specified timestamp will not be copied to the destination.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the copying operation. The default, preferred method
   is to use a MapReduce program (true).

   When this parameter is set to false, a client process uses multiple
   threads to read rows of the source table and write rows to the
   destination table.
   bulkload A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to perform a
   full bulk load of the table. The default is to use bulk loading (true).
   When you use bulk loading, the utility automatically unsets the bulk
   load mode on the table to restore normal client operations at the end
   of the table copy operation. For more information, see [4]Bulk Loading
   and MapR-DB Tables.
   numthreads When -mapreduce is false, this parameter specifies the
   number of threads allocated to perform the copying of data. The default
   is 16. If additional CPU resources are available, you might want to
   increase the number of threads to achieve better performance.

Monitoring the CopyTable Operation

   Use one of the following methods to monitor the progress of the copying
   of table data:
     * If the copy table operation runs as a MapReduce v2 application,
       monitor the application using the ResourceManager UI.
     * If the copy table operation runs as a client process, go to the
       Tables view of the destination table in the MapR Control System.
       Then, on the Region tab, monitor the pace at which the number of
       rows increases.

Example

   Copies table data with timestamp greater than 1423226300000 (Fri, 06
   Feb 2015 12:38:20 GMT) from one MapR-DB table to another MapR-DB table:
[user@hostname ~]$  hbase com.mapr.fs.hbase.tools.mapreduce.CopyTable -src /t1 -
dst /t1_copy7  -starttime 1423226300000
