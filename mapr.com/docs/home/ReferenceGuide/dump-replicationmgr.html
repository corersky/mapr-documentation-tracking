dump replicationmanagerinfo

   Returns information about which containers are under or over replicated
   in a specified volume.

   For each container, the command displays the current state of that
   container.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli dump replicationmanagerinfo
     [-cluster <cluster name>]
     -volumename <volume name>

          Note: For best results, use the -json option from the command
          line.

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description

   cluster

   The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is omitted,
   the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.

   volumename

   Specifies the name of the volume. To obtain a volume name, use the
   maprcli volume list command.

Output

   The maprcli dump replicationmanagerinfo returns information about
   volumes and the containers on those volumes including the nodes on
   which the containers have been replicated and the space allocated to
   each container. If replication activity is not underway when the
   maprcli command is executed, no container information is included. If
   replication activity is underway, details of containers are listed.

   Output fields

   Field

   Description

   VolumeName

   Indicates the name of the volume.

   VolumeId

   Indicates the ID number of the volume.

   VolumeTopology

   The volume topology corresponds to the node topology of the rack or
   nodes where the volume resides. By default, new volumes are created
   with a topology of / (root directory). For more information, see
   [1]Volume Topology.

   VolumeUsedSizeMB

   The size on disk (in MB) of the volume.

   VolumeReplication

   The desired replication factor, the number of copies of a volume
   excluding the original. The default value is 3.

   VolumeMinReplication

   The minimum replication factor, the number of copies of a volume
   (excluding the original) that should be maintained by the MapR cluster
   for normal operation. When the replication factor falls below this
   minimum, writes to the volume are disabled. The default value is 2.
   MirrorThrottle Specifies whether mirror throttling is enabled (true) or
   disabled (false). Throttling is set on the source volume and applies to
   all its mirrors. This property was introduced in version 4.0.2.
   AccessTime A value that can be used to determine which volumes are
   accessed regularly. This value is updated every 6 hours with the last
   time that an operation occurred on the volume. The access time is not
   updated for changes to volume properties, creation of a snapshot, or
   synchronization between a volume and a mirror. However, the volume
   access time is updated the first time you upgrade to a MapR version
   that includes this property. This property was introduced in version
   4.0.2.
   limitSpread An internal flag for MapR volumes to control the growth of
   volume in terms of number of containers. When this flag is set, cldb
   tries to limit the number of new containers created depending on the
   present size of volume. If volume size (data in volume) is small, cldb
   tries to reuse space in existing containers to avoid the creation of
   new containers. This helps reduce the wasting of containers IDs in an
   environment that has small volumes.

   ContainerId

   The unique ID number for the container.

   Epoch

   A sequence number that indicates the most recent copy of the container.
   The CLDB uses the epoch to ensure that an out-of-date copy cannot
   become the master for the container.

   Master

   The physical IP address and port number of the master copy. The master
   copy is part of the original copy of the volume.

   ActiveServers

   The physical IP address and port number of each active node on which
   the container resides.

   InactiveServers

   The physical IP address and port number of each inactive node on which
   the container resides.

   UnusedServers

   The physical IP address and port number of each on which the container
   does not reside.

   OwnedSizeMB

   The size on disk (in MB) dedicated to the container.

   SharedSizeMB

   The size on disk (in MB) shared by the container.

   LogicalSizeMB

   The logical size on disk (in MB) of the container.

   Mtime

   Indicates the time of the last modification to the container's
   contents.

   NameContainer

   Indicates if the container is the name container for the volume. If
   true, the container is the volume's first container and replication
   occurs simultaneously from the master to the intermediate and tail
   containers.

Example

   CLI

maprcli dump replicationmanagerinfo -cluster docs41cluster -volumename mapr.metr
ics -json
