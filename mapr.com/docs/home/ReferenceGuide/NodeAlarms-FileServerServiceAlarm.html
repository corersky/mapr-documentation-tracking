FileServer Service Alarm

   UI Column
          FileServer Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_SERVICE_FILESERVER_DOWN

   Meaning
          The FileServer service on the node has stopped running.

   Resolution
          Go to the [1]node information page or the Services page in MCS
          to check whether the FileServer service is running. The warden
          will try three times to restart the service automatically. After
          an interval (30 minutes by default) the warden will again try
          three times to restart the service. The interval can be
          configured using the parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec
          in warden.conf file. If the warden successfully restarts the
          FileServer service, the alarm is cleared. If the warden is
          unable to restart the FileServer service, it may be necessary to
          contact technical support.
