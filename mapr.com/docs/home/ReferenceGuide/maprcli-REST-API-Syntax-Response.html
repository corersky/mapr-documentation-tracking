Response

   Describes the different return responses.

   The commands return responses in JSON or in a tabular format. When you
   run commands from the command line, the response is returned in tabular
   format unless you specify JSON using the -json option; when you run
   commands through the REST interface, the response is returned in JSON.
   Note: The columns returned by operations such as get, list, info, and
   so on are not sorted in any particular order.

Success

   On a successful call, each command returns the error code zero (OK) and
   any data requested. When JSON output is specified, the data is returned
   as an array of records along with the status code and the total number
   of records. In the tabular format, the data is returned as a sequence
   of rows, each of which contains the fields in the record separated by
   tabs.

   JSON

{
              "status":"OK",
              "total":<number of records>,
              "data":[
              {
              <record>
              }
              ...
              ]
              }

Error

   When an error occurs, the command returns the error code and
   descriptive message.

   JSON

{
            "status":"ERROR",
            "errors":[
            {
            "id":<error code>,
            "desc":"<command>: <error message>"
            }
            ]
            }

   Tabular

ERROR (<error code>) -  <command>: <error message>
