Table Replication Asynchronous

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_TABLE_REPL_ASYNC

   Meaning
          These alarms display the pathnames of the source tables that are
          involved.

          If MapR-DB is replicating synchronously and it judges the
          latency of the replication stream to be too high, it will switch
          to asynchronous replication temporarily.

          After a new gateway is created, an existing gateway is
          restarted, or after latency is sufficiently reduced, MapR-DB
          switches the mode of replication back to synchronous.

          You can also check whether a source table is being replicated
          synchronously or asynchronously by running the command [1]table
          replica list .
