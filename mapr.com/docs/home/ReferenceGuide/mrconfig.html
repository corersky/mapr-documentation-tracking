mrconfig

   The mrconfig commands let you create, remove, and manage storage pools,
   disk groups, and disks; and provide information about containers.
   Warning: The mrconfig commands provide direct control and low-level
   access to the MapR file system. If you are not careful, or do not know
   what you are doing, you can irrevocably destroy valuable data.
