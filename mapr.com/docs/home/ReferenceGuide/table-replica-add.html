table replica add

   Registers a table as a replica of another MapR-DB binary or JSON table.
   Note: You do not need to use this command it you use the table replica
   autosetup command.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce and writeAce on both the source volume and the target
       volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the paths of both tables
     * readperm and replperm permissions on the source table

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-DB does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli table replica add
  -path <table path>
  -replica <replica table path>
  [ -columns <comma separated list of <family>[:<column>]>  ]
  [ -paused <is replication paused> default: false ]
  [ -throttle <throttle replication ops> default: false> ]
  [ -networkencryption <enable on-wire encryption> default: false> ]
  [ -synchronous <is synchronous replication> default: false ]
  [ -networkcompression <on-wire compression type: off|on|lzf|lz4|zlib> default:
 on ]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   path

   The path to the source table that you want to replicate.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named testsrc under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testsrc

     * For a path on another cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customersrc under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customersrc

   replica

   The path to the replica.
     * For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
       mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under a volume
       with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following path:
       /volume1/testdst

     * For a table on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customerdst under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   Note: For replication to a table, the command will fail if the table in
   the replica path does not exist.
   columns

   By default, all columns in the source table are replicated.
   If you do not want to replicate all columns in the table, you can
   specify specific columns to replicate:

   For binary tables
          Provide a comma-separated list of column families or columns
          from a certain column family (column family:qualifier). For
          example, use the following syntax to replicate the column family
          purchases and the column stars in the reviews column family:
          -columns purchases,reviews:stars

          Note: While the column families that you specify must already
          exist in the source table, the columns that you specify do not
          have to exist in the destination table for replication to
          succeed. If the column is added at a later date, replication for
          that column will start at that time.

   For JSON tables
          Provide a comma-delimited list of fields to replicate. Include
          the full field path for each field.

          Example

          Suppose your table contains documents that contain this general
          structure:

{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}

          To replicate fields a, c, and e, you would specify these field
          paths:

a,a.b.c,a.e

          Do not use quotation marks and do not include spaces after
          commas.

          Suppose now that a.b and a.e were custom column families. You
          want to replicate only the default column family and column
          family a.e. To do so, you would specify field paths like this:

",a.e"

          The empty string before the comma indicates the default column
          family.

   paused

   A Boolean value that specifies whether to pause the replication so that
   it does not start immediately. The replication can be resumed using the
   replica resume command at a later time. The values are true or false.
   Default: Not paused (false)
   throttle A Boolean value that specifies whether to throttle replication
   operations. Throttle the replication stream to minimize the impact of
   the replication process on incoming operations during periods of heavy
   load. The values are true or false. Default: No throttle (false)
   networkencryption A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to
   enable on-wire encryption. The values are true or false. If you set
   this to true, the local cluster and any other cluster that is part of
   the replication process must be enabled for security. Default: No
   encryption (false)
   synchronous

   A Boolean value that specifies whether replication is synchronous or
   asynchronous. The values are true or false. Default: Asynchronous
   (false)
   networkcompression

   The type of on-wire compression. Default: on

   The types are:
     * off
     * on (default)
     * lzf
     * lz4
     * zlib

   The default compression is lz4, which can be set by specifying on or
   lz4 as value.

Example

   Registers a table on the local cluster as a replica of another table on
   the local cluster:

   CLI

maprcli table replica add -path /volume1/custA -replica /volume2/custA
