Inodes Limit Exceeded

   UI Column
          Inodes Exceeded Alarm

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_INODES_EXCEEDED

   Meaning
          The volume contains too many files or the size of the namespace
          container size has exceeded the configured limit.

   Resolution
          This alarm indicates that not enough volumes are set up to
          handle the number of files stored in the cluster or the size of
          the name container exceeds the limit. Typically, each user or
          project should have a separate volume. To resolve the name
          container issue, investigate the cause for the alarm. After
          careful consideration, create one or more volumes and move data
          into the new volumes. Before increasing the alarm threshold,
          contact MapR Support.

   Configuration
          Configurable at cluster and volume level. See [1]Configuring the
          Alarm Threshold Using the CLI for more information.
