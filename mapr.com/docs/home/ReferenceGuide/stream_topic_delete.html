stream topic delete

   Deletes the specified topic from the specified stream.
   Consumers do not have to stop consuming from a topic before the topic
   is deleted.

   The deletion of the topic and the messages is immediate. However, the
   command also starts a background process for the purging the topic and
   messages to reclaim disk space.

   If the parameter -autocreate for the stream is set to true, a topic
   with the same name is created if a producer writes a message to a topic
   of the same name. For example, if you delete the topic Topic_A and then
   a producer writes a message to the topic Topic_A, MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka creates a topic that is named Topic_A. Aside from the
   name, the new topic Topic_A shares nothing with the deleted topic
   Topic_A.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * topicperm permission on the stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this command unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.
