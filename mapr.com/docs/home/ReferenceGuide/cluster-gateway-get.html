cluster gateway get

   Lists the MapR gateways that a source MapR cluster is using.

   The source MapR cluster could be using the MapR gateways either for
   replication of table data to a destination MapR cluster or for the
   indexing of data in an Elasticsearch cluster.

   This list of gateways is created by the maprcli cluster gateway set
   command.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway get
    -dstcluster <destinationCluster>
    [ -cluster <sourceCluster> ]

   REST

http[s]://<host>:<port>/rest/cluster/gateway/get?dstcluster=<path>&cluster=<path

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   dstcluster

   The name of the cluster on which the gateways are located.

   If you are replicating table data to another MapR cluster, specify the
   name of that destination cluster. This destination cluster could be the
   source cluster if you are performing intracluster replication.

   If you are indexing table data in an Elasticsearch cluster, specify the
   name of the source MapR cluster because that is where the gateways are
   located.
   cluster If you are not on the source cluster, provide the name of the
   source cluster that this command should be run on.

Example

   Gets the list of gateways that is stored on a source MapR cluster. The
   gateways are being used for table replication and are located in the
   destination MapR cluster sfcluster.

   CLI

maprcli cluster gateway get -dstcluster sfcluster
