Volume Become Master Stuck

   UI Column
          VOLUME BECOME MASTER STUCK

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_BECOME_MASTER_STUCK

   Meaning
          This means that there are some containers (associated with the
          volume) that donâ€™t have Master role. The alarm description
          displays the containers on which Master role is not assigned.

   Resolution
          Run [1]dump containerinfo command to determine the node on which
          role is not assigned and restart that node. If you see the alarm
          after the node is restarted, contact MapR support.
