table create

   Creates a new MapR Database binary or JSON table.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce and [2]writeAce on the volume
     * [3]lookupdir on directories in the path

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description

   path

   The path to the new MapR Database table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   copymetafrom

   The path to a table that contains the metadata that should be used to
   create the table.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, if you want to copymetadata from a table named
       test under volume1 which has a mount point at /volume1, specify the
       following path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, if you want to copymetadata from a
       table named test under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify
       the following path: /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   copymetatype

   The type of metadata to copy from the table identified in the
   copymetafrom parameter. You can specify one or more of the following
   options in a comma separated list:
     * all. Copy all metadata. This is the default.
     * cfs. Copy column family metadata.
     * aces. Copy ACE permissions.
     * splits. Copy split keys.
     * attrs. Copy table attributes.

   regionsizemb

   The average size of the regions into which MapR Database tries to split
   the table as the table grows. The default is 4096 MB. This value is
   ignored if autosplit is set to false.

   If autosplit is set to true, MapR Database splits a region when the
   size of the region exceeds 150% of the average value. For example, if
   the average value is 4096 MB, MapR Database splits a region that is
   larger than 6144 MB.

   Although splits are automatic, merges are not. For example, if the
   value of regionsizemb is changed from 8 GB to 4 GB, all regions that
   are eligible are split automatically, if autosplit is set to true.
   However, if the value of regionsizemb is changed from 2 GB to 4 GB,
   regions smaller than 4 GB are not automatically merged.
   Note: When a table has less than 4 regions, MapR Database ignores the
   regionsizemb parameter and splits regions at a lower threshold.
   autosplit

   A Boolean value that specifies whether to split the table into regions
   automatically as the table grows. The average size of each region is
   determined by the regionsizemb parameter.

   The default value is true. If you set the value to false, you can
   manually split tables into regions by using the table region split
   command.
   bulkload

   A Boolean value that specifies whether to allow a full bulk load of the
   table. The default is false. For more information, see [4]Loading Data
   into Binary Tables and [5]Loading Documents into JSON Tables.
   audit Specifies whether to turn auditing on for the table. If auditing
   is also enabled at the cluster level with the maprcli audit data
   command and enabled for the current volume, setting this value to true
   causes auditing to start for the table.
   tabletype Specifies whether the table will be a binary table or a JSON
   table. The values are binary and json. The default is binary.
   packperm The Access Control Expression that controls who can pack table
   regions. By default, permission is given to the user ID that is used to
   create the table.
   bulkloadperm The Access Control Expression that controls who can load
   this table with bulk loads if the table was created with bulk load
   support. By default, permission is given to the user ID that is used to
   create the table.
   splitmergeperm

   The Access Control Expression that controls who can take the following
   actions:
     * Run the table region split and table region merge commands to split
       the table into regions or to merge regions of the table together.
     * Change the value of regionsizemb.

   By default, permission is given to the user ID that is used to create
   the table.
   createrenamefamilyperm The Access Control Expression that controls who
   can create column families for this table or rename existing column
   families. By default, permission is given to the user ID that is used
   to create the table.
   deletefamilyperm The Access Control Expression that defines access to
   delete column families for this table. Delimit the expression with
   single-quotation marks. By default, permission is given to the user ID
   that is used to create the table.
   adminaccessperm The Access Control Expression that controls who can
   view and edit the permissions for this table. By default, permission is
   given to the user ID that is used to create the table.
   replperm The Access Control Expression that controls who can set up
   replication either to or from a table. By default, permission is given
   to the user ID that is used to create the table
   indexperm The secondary index Admin permissions setting that controls
   who can create an index associated with this table. By default,
   permission is given to the user ID that is used to create the table.

   defaultversionperm
   The default Access Control Expression for the version permission on new
   column families that are created in this table. If no value is
   specified, the default is u:<username of the table creator>. This value
   of the parameter versionperm in the table cf create and table cf edit
   commands overrides this value.
   Note: This permission is not applicable to JSON tables. Versioning is
   not supported for JSON documents.
   defaultcompressionperm Applies to binary tables only: The default
   Access Control Expression for the compression permission on new column
   families that are created in this table. If no value is specified, the
   default is u:<username of the table creator>. This value of the
   parameter compressionperm in the table cf create and table cf edit
   commands overrides this value.

   defaultmemoryperm

   The default Access Control Expression for the memory permission on new
   column families that are created in this table. If no value is
   specified, the default is u:<username of the table creator>. This value
   of the parameter memoryperm in the table cf create and table cf edit
   commands overrides this value.
   defaultreadperm The default Access Control Expression for the read
   permission on new column families that are created in this table. If no
   value is specified, the default is u:<username of the table creator>.
   This value of the parameter readperm in the table cf create and table
   cf edit commands overrides this value. See [6]table cf create and
   [7]table cf edit
   defaultwriteperm The default Access Control Expression for the write
   permission on new column families that are created in this table. If no
   value is specified, the default is u:<username of the table creator>.
   This value of the parameter writeperm in the table cf create and table
   cf edit commands overrides this value. See [8]table cf create and
   [9]table cf edit
   defaulttraverseperm Applies to JSON tables only: The default Access
   Control Expression for the traverse permission on new column families.
   For more information about this permission, see [10]Permission Types
   for Fields and Column Families in JSON Tables.
   defaultappendperm Applies to binary tables only: The default Access
   Control Expression for the append permission on new column families
   that are created in this table. If no value is specified, the default
   is u:<username of the table creator>. This value of the parameter
   appendperm in the table cf create and table cf edit commands overrides
   this value.
   metricsinterval

   The metrics collection interval, in seconds, for the table.

   Possible values: 10, 60, 600

   Default: 60 seconds

   When configured to 10 seconds, under normal workloads, the metrics are
   available in OpenTSDB in about 30 seconds. At an interval of 60
   seconds, the metrics are available in about 90 seconds.
   Note: You cannot disable metrics collection for a table by setting the
   interval to 0.
