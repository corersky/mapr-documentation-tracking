MapR Database JSON ImportJSON

   Imports one or more JSON documents into a MapR Database JSON table. The
   JSON documents must be flat text files.

Required Permissions

     * The readAce permission on the volume where the JSON documents to
       import are located.
     * The writeAce permission on the volume in which the destination
       table is located.

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [1]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to run this utility unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax

mapr importJSON
[-idfield <Name of ID field in JSON Data>]
[-bulkload <true|false>, default is false]
[-mapreduce : <true|false>, default is true]
-src <text file or directory>
-dst <JSON table>

Parameters

     *

   Parameter Description
   idfield The name of the field that contains the value to use for each
   document's _id field.

   An _id field is inserted into each document that is imported into a
   table, if the document does not already contain one.

   Documents that do not already contain an _id field must contain a field
   with a value that can be used for the inserted _id field.

   For example, each document might have a product_ID field with a value
   that would be suitable for the _id field.

   Use quotation marks around the name.
   bulkload A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to perform a
   full bulk load of the table. The default is not to use bulk loading
   (true). After a bulk load, you must set the -bulkload parameter of the
   table to false by running the command maprcli table edit -path <path to
   table> -bulkload false.

   This parameter cannot be set to true when the -mapreduce parameter is
   set to false.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the copying operation. The default, preferred method
   is to use a MapReduce program (true).
   src The path of a JSON document in text format or a directory of such
   documents.

   If you specify a directory and that directory contains only the JSON
   files to import, use an asterisk at the end of the path, as in this
   example: /user/data/*

   If you specify a directory and that directory contains both the JSON
   files to import and other files, use a more specific wildcard, such as
   *.json .

   The path must be in the MapR filesystem. To move files there from the
   Linux filesystem, use the command hadoop fs -copyFromLocal.
   dst The path of the destination MapR Database JSON table.

Example

   Suppose you have the following three JSON documents in the /tmp/users
   directory in your MapR filesystem:
$ hadoop fs -cat /tmp/users/bcummings.json
{"_id":"bcummings","first_name":"Bettie","last_name":"Cummings"}

$ hadoop fs -cat /tmp/users/gjones.json
{"_id":"gjones","first_name":"Gilberto","last_name":"Jones"}

$ hadoop fs -cat /tmp/users/jdoe.json
{"_id":"jdoe","first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe"}

   The following command imports the three documents into the JSON table
   in the path /apps/users:
$ mapr importJSON -idField _id -src /tmp/users/* -dst /apps/users

   You can run mapr dbshell to see the imported documents:
maprdb mapr:> find /apps/users
{"_id":"bcummings","first_name":"Bettie","last_name":"Cummings"}
{"_id":"gjones","first_name":"Gilberto","last_name":"Jones"}
{"_id":"jdoe","first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe"}
3 document(s) found.
