Syntax

   CAPTION:

   CLI
maprcli stream cursor list
         -path <Stream Path>
        [ -consumergroup <Consumer Group ID> ]
        [ -topic <Topic Name> ]
        [ -partition <Partition ID> ]

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   path The path and name of the stream in which the cursors are located.
   consumergroup Specifies the ID of a particular consumer group that you
   want to list the cursors for.
   topic The name of a topic to list committed cursors from. If you also
   specify the -partition parameter, only the committed cursors in the
   indicated partition are listed.
   partition The ID of the partition where the particular cursor that you
   want to list is located. If you specify this ID, you must also use the
   -topic parameter.

          The ID of the consumer group to which belongs the consumer that
          owns the committed cursor.

   committedoffset
          The last offset that was committed by the consumer that is
          reading from the listed partition and that belongs to the listed
          consumer group.

   consumerlagmillis
          The difference in milliseconds between the timestamp of the last
          published message and the timestamp of the last message consumed
          by the consumer.

   consumertimestamp
          The timestamp of the most recent message that the consumer has
          consumed.

   partitionid
          The index number of the partition within the topic. The first
          partition in a topic has an index of 0, the next partition an
          index of 1, and so on.

   produceroffset
