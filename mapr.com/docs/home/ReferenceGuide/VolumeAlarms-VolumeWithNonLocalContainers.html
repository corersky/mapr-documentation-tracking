   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_DATA_CONTAINERS_NONLOCAL

   Meaning
          This is a local volume and its containers should all reside on
          the same node. Some containers were created on another node,
          which may cause performance issues in MapReduce applications.

   Resolution
          Recreate the local volume or review information on [1]how to
          handle this alarm.
