   When the command is run:

    2. All tiering activities and client reads and overwrites on the
       volume are suspended.
    3. The volume is reassinged to another MAST Gateway.

   You must manually run the [1]mastgateway resumevolume command to resume
   tiering activities, including reads and overwrites, on the volume data.
