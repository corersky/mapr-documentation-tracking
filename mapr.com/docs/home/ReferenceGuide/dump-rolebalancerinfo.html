dump rolebalancerinfo

   Returns information about active replication role switches.

   Use the dump rolebalancerinfo command to see if the replication role
   balancer is currently switching the replication roles of any containers
   in a cluster. For example, if too many data containers with the master
   or intermediate roles exist within a storage pool, the replication role
   balancer switches the role of some of these containers to the tail role
   to evenly spread load across nodes during the replication process. If
   the role balancer is not currently switching the roles of any
   containers, the command returns a message stating that there are no
   active role switches.

   You can include some additional parameters with the dump
   rolebalancerinfo command, such as the volumeinfo parameter, which
   provides information about how the replication role balancer balanced
   container roles across each storage pool in a particular volume.

   See [1]Replication Role Balancer for more information about how the
   replication role balancer works.

   For the best readability, use the -json option at the end of the
   command.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli dump rolebalancerinfo
    [-cluster <cluster name>]

    [-volumeinfo]
    [-volumename <volume name>]
    [-namecntrinfo]

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   cluster The cluster on which to run the command. When you omit this
   parameter, the command runs on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   a multi-cluster environment, use this parameter to specify a particular
   cluster.
   stats Provides a list of active switches for the role balancer. The
   command returns the same information with or without this parameter.
   volumeinfo Provides the volume balancing information and details how
   the container roles are balanced across each storage pool in a volume.
   Requires the volumename parameter.
   volumename The name of the volume. To obtain volume names, use the
   maprcli volume list command.
   namecntrinfo Provides information about how the name containers are
   distributed across the storage pools in the cluster, including how many
   name containers are master and tail containers. More informative when
   the replication role balancer is configured to balance container roles
   by count instead of size.

Output

   The following example shows the output of the dump rolebalancerinfo
   command when the replication role balancer switches a container to the
   tail role:
# maprcli dump rolebalancerinfo -json
{
      "timestamp":1452150159265,
      "timeofday":"2016-01-07 07:02:39.265 GMT+0000",
      "status":"OK",
      "total":1,
      "data":[
             {
                   "containerid":57482,
                   "Tail IP:Port":"10.10.104.37:5660-10.10.105.37:5660-",

              }
        ]
   }

   The following example shows the dump rolebalancerinfo -volumeinfo
   -volumename command:

   Output

   CAPTION:

   Field Description
   containerID The unique ID number of the container.
   Tail IP:Port The IP address and port number of the tail container node.
   Updates blocked Since During a replication role switch, updates to that
   container are blocked during the date and time indicated.
   Volume Name of the volume.
   Assign Cache Containers Count The total number of containers in the
   assign cache. The assign cache is a list of containers that the CLDB
   has reserved on a particular fileserver node. The CLDB allocates
   containers from the cache when it receives a request from the
   fileserver for more containers.
   Assign Cache Containers Size The total size of the containers in the
   assigned cache. The assign cache is a list of containers that the CLDB
   has reserved on a particular fileserver node. The CLDB allocates
   containers from the cache when it receives a request from the
   fileserver for more containers.
   Zero Size Containers Count The number of empty cache containers.
   Storage Pools The list of storage pools in the specified volume.
   SpId The ID of the storage pool located within the specified volume.
   HostAddress The server on which the storage pool resides.
   NumContainers The total number of containers that reside on the storage
   pool in the specified volume.
   NumMasters The total number of master containers that reside on the
   storage pool in the specified volume.
   NumTails The total number of tail containers that reside on the storage
   pool in the specified volume.
   SizeOfContainers The total size of the containers that reside on the
   storage pool in the specified volume.
   SizeOfMasters The total size of the master containers that reside on
   the storage pool in the specified volume.
   DesiredSizeOfMasters The cumulative size of master replicas on a
   specific storage pool within a volume. Typically, this is
   1/ReplicationFactor of all containers on a storage pool for a
   particular volume. For example, if the replication factor is set to 3,
   then ⅓ of all containers on a storage pool should have the master
   container role.
   SizeOfTails The total size of the tail containers that reside on the
   storage pool in the specified volume.
   DesiredSizeOfTails The cumulative size of tail replicas on a specific
   storage pool within a volume. Typically, this is 1/ReplicationFactor of
   all containers on a storage pool for a particular volume. For example,
   if the replication factor is set to 3, then ⅓ of all containers on a
   storage pool should have the tail container role.
