stream upstream list

   Lists all of the streams that are replicating to a given stream.

Permissions Required on the Target Cluster

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce on the volume
     * [2]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm permission on the source stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run this command unless that user is given the
   relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.
