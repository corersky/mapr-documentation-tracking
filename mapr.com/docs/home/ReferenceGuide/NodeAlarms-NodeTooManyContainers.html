   UI Column
          Too Many Containers Alarm

   Logged As
          NODE_ALARM_TOO_MANY_CONTAINERS

   Meaning
          Number of containers on this node reached the maximum limit.

   Resolution
          Delete unused volumes or Snapshots. You can reset the maximum
          with:

          maprcli config save -values
          {"pernode.numcntrs.alarm.thr":"<number>"}

   Configuration
          Configurable at cluster level.

          This alarm is also raised when total number of containers
          (including snap containers) exceed 10 times the value of
          pernode.numcntrs.alarm.thr.

          See [1]Configuring the Alarm Threshold Using the CLI for more
          information.
