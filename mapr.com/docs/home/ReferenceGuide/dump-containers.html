dump containers

   Returns information about containers in a cluster.

   This command provides information about containers based on the
   following -type criteria:
     * offline - Returns information about containers that have no valid
       copies online. This command is useful when you need to find out
       exactly what data is offline (for example, when a "volume data
       unavailable" alarm is raised).
     * resync - Returns information about containers that are
       resynchronizing.
     * bm - Returns information about containers that are becoming master
       but are not yet master.
     * unused - Returns information about containers that are unused.
     * waiting - Returns information about containers that are waiting for
       a role.

   A container is a unit of sharded storage in a MapR cluster. Every
   container in a MapR volume is either a name container or a data
   container. The name container is the first container in a volume and
   holds that volume's namespace and file chunk locations. Depending on
   its replication role, a name container may be either a master container
   (part of the original copy of the volume) or a replica container (one
   of the replicas in the replication chain).

   Every data container is either a master container, an intermediate
   container, or a tail container.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli dump containers
    [ -cluster <cluster_name> ]
     -type offline|resync|bm|waiting|unused

          Note: For best results, use the -json option from the command
          line.

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description
   cluster

   The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is omitted,
   the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.

   type

   Specifies the type of information that is returned about the
   containers:
     * offline - Returns information about containers that have no valid
       copies online.
     * resync - Returns information about containers that are
       resynchronizing.
     * bm - Returns information about containers that are becoming master
       but are not yet master.
     * unused - Returns information about containers that are unused.
     * waiting - Returns information about containers that are waiting for
       a role.

Output fields

   CAPTION:

   Field

   Description

   ContainerID

   The unique ID number for the container.

   Epoch

   A sequence number that indicates the most recent copy of the container.
   The CLDB uses the epoch to ensure that an out-of-date copy cannot
   become the master for the container.

   Master

   The physical IP address and port number of the master copy. The master
   copy is part of the original copy of the volume.

   ActiveServers

   The physical IP address and port number of each active node on which
   the container resides.

   InactiveServers

   The physical IP address and port number of each inactive node on which
   the container resides.

   UnusedServers

   The physical IP address and port number of servers from which no
   "heartbeat" has been received for quite some time.

   OwnedSizeMB

   The size on disk (in MB) dedicated to the container.

   SharedSizeMB

   The size on disk (in MB) shared by the container.

   LogicalSizeMB

   The logical size on disk (in MB) of the container.

   TotalSizeMB

   The total size on disk (in MB) allocated to the container. Combines the
   Owned Size and Shared Size.

   Mtime

   The time of the last modification to the contents of the container.

   NameContainer

   Indicates if the container is the name container for the volume. If
   true, the container holds the volume's namespace information and file
   chunk locations.

   VolumeName

   The name of the volume.

   VolumeId

   The unique ID number of the volume.

   VolumeReplication

   The replication factor, the number of copies of a volume excluding the
   original.

   VolumeMounted

   Indicates whether the volume is mounted. If true, the volume is
   currently mounted. If false, the volume is not mounted.

Example

   CLI

maprcli dump containers -type offline -cluster my.cluster -json
