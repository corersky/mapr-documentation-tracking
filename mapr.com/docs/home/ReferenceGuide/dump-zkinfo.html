dump zkinfo

   Returns the ZooKeeper znodes.
   Note: This command is used by the mapr-support-collect.sh script to
   gather cluster diagnostics for troubleshooting.

   This command enables you to view a snapshot of the data stored in
   Zookeeper as a result of cluster operations

   ZooKeeper prevents service coordination conflicts by enforcing a rigid
   set of rules and conditions, provides cluster-wide information about
   running services and their configuration, and provides a mechanism for
   almost instantaneous service failover. Warden will not start any
   services unless ZooKeeper is reachable and more than half of the
   configured ZooKeeper nodes are live.

   The mapr-support-collect.sh script calls the maprcli dump supportdump
   command to gather cluster diagnostics for troubleshooting. For more
   information, see [1]mapr-support-collect.sh.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli dump zkinfo
    [-cluster <cluster name>]
    [-zkconnect <connect string>]

          Note: For best results, use the -json option from the command
          line.

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter

   Description
   cluster The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is
   omitted, the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.
   zkconnect A ZooKeeper connect string, which specifies a list of the
   hosts running ZooKeeper, and the port to use on each, in the format:
   '<host>[:<port>][,<host>[:<port>]...]'. To obtain zookeeper connection
   strings, use the maprcli node listzookeepers command.

Output

   The maprcli dump zkinfo command is run as part of support dump tools to
   view the current state of the Zookeeper service. The command should
   always be run using the -json option, since output in the default
   tabular format is not useful. Command output displays the data stored
   in the ZooKeeper hierarchical tree of znodes.

                                }
        ]
}

   Output fields

   You can use the maprcli dump zkinfo command as you would use a database
   snapshot. The /services, /services_config, /servers, and /*_locks
   znodes are used by Warden to store and exchange information.

   CAPTION:

   Field

   Description

   services

   The /services directory is used by Warden to store and exchange
   information about services.

   datacenter

   The /datacenter directory contains CLDB "vital signs" that you can use
   to identify the CLDB master, the most recent epoch, and other key data.
   For more information, see [2]Moving CLDB Data.

   services_config

   The /services_config directory is used by Warden to store and exchange
   information.

   zookeeper

   The /zookeeper directory stores information about the ZooKeeper
   service.

   servers

   The /servers directory is used by Warden to store and exchange
   information.

   nodes

   The /nodes directory (znode) stores key information about the nodes.
