mapr exportstream and mapr importstream

   Use these utilities together to export data from MapR streams into
   binary sequence files, and then import the data from the binary
   sequence files into other MapR streams. You can also use the mapr
   importstream utility to import changes that are specified in sequence
   files output by the mapr diffstreams utility.

Required Permissions

   To use the mapr exportstream utility, you must have the following
   permissions:
     * The readAce permission on the volume where the source stream for
       mapr exportstream is located.
     * The writeAce permission on the volume in which to save the output
       from mapr exportstream.
     * On the source stream: either consumeperm or copyperm
     * On the destination directory: write permission

   To use the mapr importstream utility, you must have the following
   permissions:
     * The readAce permission on the volume where the files output by mapr
       exportstream is located.
     * The writeAce permission on the volume in which the destination
       stream is located.
     * On the source directory: read permission on the directory and all
       of the files within it
     * On the destination stream: either copyperm or all three of the
       following permissions: produceperm, consumeperm, topicperm

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [5]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on streams, see
   [6]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR-ES does not
   allow the mapr user to run these utilities unless that user is given
   the relevant permission or permissions with access-control expressions.

Syntax of mapr exportstream

mapr exportstream
-src <srcStream>
-dst <dstDir>
[-mapreduce true/false default:false]

Parameters of mapr exportstream

   Description Parameter
   src The stream to export data from.
   dst The directory within the MapR filesystem to export the files to.
   This directory must already exist before you run the utility.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the operation. The default, preferred method is to
   use a MapReduce program (true).

   When this parameter is set to false, a client process uses multiple
   threads.

Syntax of mapr importstream

mapr importstream
-src Input binary file or directory path
-dst Destination stream
[-mapreduce true/false default:false]

Parameters of mapr importstream

   Description                    Parameter
   src The path of the binary file or files to import.
   Examples
-src /temp/part0
-src /temp/*

   dst         The stream to import data into.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the operation. The default, preferred method is to
   use a MapReduce program (true).

   When this parameter is set to false, a client process uses multiple
   threads.
