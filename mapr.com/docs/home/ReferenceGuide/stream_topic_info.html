stream topic info

   Lists information about a stream's topic, grouped by partition ID.

Permissions Required

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [1]readAce on the volume
     * [2]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm, consumeperm, produceperm, or topicperm permission on the
       stream

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this command unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.

Field Descriptions

   partitionid
          The index number of the partition within the topic. The first
          partition in a topic has an index of 0, the next partition an
          index of 1, and so on.

   physicalsize
          The physical size (in bytes) of the stream topic with data
          compression.

   logicalsize
          The logical size (in bytes) of the stream topic without data
          compression.

   maxoffset
          The maximum offset for this partition.

   minoffsetacrossconsumers
          All known consumers for this partition have consumed messages at
          least up to this offset.

   mintimestamp
          The timestamp of oldest message in the partition.

   maxtimestamp
          The timestamp of newest message in the partition.

   mintimestampacrossconsumers
          All known consumers for this partition have consumed messages
          older than this timestamp.

   fid
          The inode hosting the head of the partition.

   master
          For use by MapR support: The master server that is hosting the
          head of the partition.

   servers
          For use by MapR support: Lists all of the servers that are
          hosting the head of the partition.

   timestamptype
          The type of timestamp stored in the topic's message. Possible
          values: createtime (default) and logappendtime.

   logcompactionlaststarted
          Displays the last time log compaction was started if log
          compaction was enabled. The value is displayed in epoch time.
          This field displays when there is a change in the value for this
          field.

   logcompactionlastcompleted
          Displays the last time log compaction completed if log
          compaction was enabled. The value is displayed in epoch time.
          This field displays when there is a change in the value for this
          field

   logcompactionstatus
          Displays whether log compaction was started or completed.
