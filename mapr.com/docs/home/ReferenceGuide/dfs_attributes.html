.dfs_attributes

   Each directory in MapR storage contains a hidden file called
   .dfs_attributes that controls compression and chunk size. To change
   these attributes, change the corresponding values in the file.

   Example:
# lines beginning with # are treated as comments
Compression=lz4
ChunkSize=268435456

   Valid values:
     * Compression: lz4, lzf, zlib, or false
     * Chunk size (in bytes): a multiple of 65535 (64 K) or zero (no
       chunks). Example: 131072

   You can also set compression and chunksize using the [1]hadoop mfs
   command.
