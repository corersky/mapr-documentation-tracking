mrdirectorystats

   The mrdirectorystats utility prints the space usage per directory for a
   container.

   The mrdirectorystats utility, when run for a container, will print the
   space usage information for all directories, starting from the root of
   the container. This utility is considerably faster than running ls -R
   command on the root of the container and is useful, for example, in
   identifying directories which need to be moved out to a different
   volume while trying to reduce the size of the current namespace
   container.

Syntax

/opt/mapr/server/mrdirectorystats
     -c <container_id>
     [ -p ]
     [ -h ]

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   c The ID of the container.
   h Prints help for running the command.
   p Prints only parent file ID (PFid) and other information about the
   file IDs (fids) in the container.

Output

   The utility prints the following information per directory to console
   if only -c is specified:

   CAPTION:

   DirFid The directory inode number.
   files The number of regular files under the directory.
   subdir The number of sub-directories inside the directory.
   others The number of other types of files (except directories and
   regular files), such as device, symlinks, kvstores, tables, etc.,
   inside the directory.
   tfiles The total number of regular files stored in the entire directory
   tree.
   tsubdir The total number of sub-directories stored in the entire
   directory tree.
   tothers The total number of other type of files stored in the entire
   directory tree.
   cntrBlocks The space occupied in block size (8k) by the direct blocks
   of the total regular files (tfiles) in the directory tree, for the
   current container.
   fieletBlocks A rough estimation of the sum of all the data blocks of
   all the filelets of regular files spread across different data
   containers.
   Note: The utility also shows volume links if any volume exists in the
   container.

   The utility prints the following if -p is specified with -c:

   CAPTION:

   Inode   The inode of the file.
   PFid    The parent file ID.
   Type The type of entity in the container. Value can be one of the
   following:
     * Directory — indicates the entity is a directory.
     * VolLink — indicates entity is a volume link.
     * KvStore — indicates entity is KvStore.

   SubType The sub-type of the entity in the container. Value can be one
   of the following:
     * Directory — indicates entity is directory.
     * VolLink — indicates entity is a volume link.
     * Table — indicates entity is a table. Entity can be table only if
       type is KvStore.
     * Tabletmap — indicates entity is a tabletmap. Entity can be
       tabletmap only if type is KvStore.
     * Schema — indicates entity is a schema. Entity can be schema only if
       type is KvStore.

Example

   Retrieve the disk space usage information for a container by running
   the utility with the -c option:
