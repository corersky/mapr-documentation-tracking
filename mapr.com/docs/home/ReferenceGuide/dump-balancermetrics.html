dump balancermetrics

   Returns a cumulative count of container moves and MB of data moved
   between storage pools.

   The maprcli dump balancermetrics command returns a cumulative count of
   container moves and MB of data moved between storage pools. You can run
   this command periodically to determine how much data has been moved by
   the disk space balancer between two intervals. For best results, use
   the -json option when running dump balancermetrics from the command
   line.

   The disk space balancer is a tool that balances disk space usage on a
   cluster by moving containers between storage pools. Whenever a storage
   pool is over 70% full (or it reaches a threshold defined by the
   cldb.balancer.disk.threshold.percentage parameter), the disk space
   balancer distributes containers to other storage pools that have lower
   utilization than the average for that cluster. The disk space balancer
   aims to ensure that the percentage of space used on all the disks in
   the node is similar. For more information, see [1]Disk Space Balancer.

Syntax

   CLI

maprcli dump balancermetrics
    [-cluster <cluster name>]

   REST
          N/A

Parameters

   Parameter

   Description

   cluster

   The cluster on which to run the command. If this parameter is omitted,
   the command is run on the same cluster where it is issued. In
   multi-cluster contexts, you can use this parameter to specify a
   different cluster on which to run the command.

Output

   The maprcli dump balancermetrics command returns a cumulative count of
   container moves and MB of data moved between storage pools since the
   current CLDB became the master CLDB.
