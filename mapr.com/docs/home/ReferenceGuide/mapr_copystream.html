mapr copystream

   This utility copies data from one MapR stream to another MapR stream.
   You can use it, for example, if you want to set up replication manually
   from one stream to another.

   If the destination stream does not exist, mapr copystream creates the
   destination stream with the same metadata as the source stream, and
   then copies data.

   If the destination stream exists, mapr copystream copies data only.

Requried Permissions

   To use this utility, you must have the following permissions:
     * The permission readAce on the volume where the source stream is
       located, and the permission writeAce on the volume where the
       destination stream is located.
     * On the source stream: either consumeperm or copyperm.
     * On the destination stream: either copyperm or all three of the
       following permissions: produceperm, consumeperm, topicperm

   For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see [1]Setting
   Whole Volume ACEs.

   For information about how to set permissions on streams, see
   [2]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.
   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this utility unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.

Syntax

mapr copystream
-src <srcStream>
-dst <dstStream>
[-mapreduce true/false default:false]
[-numthreads <nthreads> default:16]

Parameters

   Parameter Description
   src The path and name of the stream to copy messages from.
   dst The path and name of the stream to copy messages to.
   mapreduce

   A Boolean value that specifies whether or not to use a MapReduce
   program to perform the copying operation. The default, preferred method
   is to use a MapReduce program (true).

   When this parameter is set to false, a client process uses multiple
   threads to read from the source stream and write to the destination
   stream.

   The MapReduce program runs as a MapReduce version 2 application based
   on the MapReduce mode that is configured on this node.
   numthreads When -mapreduce is false, this parameter specifies the
   number of threads allocated to perform the copying of data. The default
   is 16. If additional CPU resources are available, you might want to
   increase the number of threads to achieve better performance.
