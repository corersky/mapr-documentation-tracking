Parameters

   Parameter

   Description
   path Path to the MapR table to delete.
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, if you want to delete a table named test under
       volume1 which has a mount point at /volume1, specify the following
       path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, if you want to delete a table named
       customer under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the
       following path: /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

Example
