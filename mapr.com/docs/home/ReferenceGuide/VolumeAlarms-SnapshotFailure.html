Snapshot Failure

   UI Column
          Snapshot Alarm

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_SNAPSHOT_FAILURE

   Meaning
          A snapshot operation failed.

   Resolution
          Make sure the CLDB is running. Look at the CLDB log
          (/opt/mapr/logs/cldb.log) and the MapR-FS log
          (/opt/mapr/logs/mfs.log) on both clusters for more information.
          If the attempted snapshot was a scheduled snapshot that was
          running in the background, try a manual snapshot.
