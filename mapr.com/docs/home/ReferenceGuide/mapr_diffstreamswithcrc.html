mapr diffstreamswithcrc

   This utility uses a cyclic redundancy check to detect differences
   between sets of messages in the specified MapR streams. Then, for each
   set of non-identical messages, it performs a detailed comparison.
   Finally, it generates one or more directories of sequence files. You
   can use these files either to make a MapR stream identical to its
   master or merge the messages from two MapR streams.

   Sequence files are binary flat files. You can learn more about them
   [1]here. To convert a sequence file into a format that you can read,
   use the [2]MapR Database JSON FormatResult utility.

   This utility requires less network bandwidth than the mapr diffstreams
   utility because it performs a detailed table comparison only on the
   sets of messages where the CRC algorithm detected a difference.
   Therefore, consider using this utility when the streams you compare are
   very similar and you are concerned about the data transfer rate.

   This utility considers both the source stream and the destination
   stream to be a master stream. Therefore, it generates two directories
   with sequence files. These sequence files contain the puts required to
   update each stream so that each stream can contain a superset of the
   messages in both streams at the time at which the utility was run.
   These are the directories that the utility generates:

   opsForDst
          A directory containing sequence files that correspond to each
          put and delete required to make the destination stream identical
          to the source stream.

   opsForSrc
          A directory containing sequence files that correspond to each
          put and delete required to make the source stream identical to
          the destination stream.

Requirements

     * When the cluster runs YARN, it must also use zero configuration
       failover for the ResourceManager.
     * To use this utility, you must have the following permissions:
          + The permission readAce on the volumes where the tables are
            located.
          + On the source stream: either consumeperm or copyperm.
          + On the destination stream: either consumeperm or copyperm.
       For information about how to set permissions on volumes, see
       [3]Setting Whole Volume ACEs.
       For information about how to set permissions on streams, see
       [4]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka does not allow the mapr user to run this utility unless
   that user is given the relevant permission or permissions with
   access-control expressions.

   Run the mapr importstream command to implement the puts and deletes
   specified in the sequence files.

Syntax

mapr diffstreamswithcrc
-src <srcStream>
-dst <dstStream>
-outdir <output directory>
[-first_exit] Exit when first difference is found

Parameters

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   src The path of the first stream to include in the comparison.
   dst The path of the second stream to include in the comparison.
   outdir The path to a directory in which to place the generated sequence
   files. The utility creates the specified directory. If the specified
   directory already exists, the command fails.
   first_exit

   By default, the utility compares all the data in the specified streams.
   Use this parameter if you want to exit after the first difference is
   identified between the streams. The parameter takes no value.
