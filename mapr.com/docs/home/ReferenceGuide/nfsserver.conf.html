nfsserver.conf

   The file /opt/mapr/conf/nfsserver.conf controls parameters related to
   MapR services and the warden. Most of the parameters are not intended
   to be edited directly by users. The following table shows the
   parameters of interest:
   Parameter Default Value Description
   Compression true Indicates whether compression is on (true) or off
   (false).
   ChunkSize 67108864 Size of each chunk. Default is 64M.
   CompThreads 2 Number of threads for compression or decompression.
   RamfsMntDir /ramfs/mapr Mount point for the ramfs file for mmap.
   RamfsSize 0.25 Size of the ramfile to use (percent of total physical
   memory). If set to 0, disables the use of ramfs.
   Loglevel INFO Sets the level of log messages displayed in the output.
   Levels include:
     * DEBUG
     * INFO
     * WARN
     * ERROR
     * CRITICAL
     * OFF

   DrCacheSize 20480 Duplicate request cache size.
   DrCacheTimeout 62 Duplicate request cache timeout in seconds.
   DRCacheTimeOutOpt 0.5 If the operations take more than DrCacheTimeout *
   DRCacheTimeOutOpt, the operations will not be cached. For example, by
   default, if the operation takes more than 31 seconds — (.5 * 62) = 31
   seconds — the operation will not be cached. It can be disabled by
   setting value to 0.
   MaxLogFileSize   The maximum amount of disk space that the NFS server
   logs can consume before the oldest log file is deleted, based on the
   following calculation:
maxSizePerLogFile = maxLogFileSize / MAX_NUM_OF_LOG_FILES

   where:

   maxLogFileSize
          Refers to the total amount of space that NFS server log files
          can consume

   MAX_NUM_OF_LOG_FILES
          Refers to the total number of NFS server log files

# Configuration for nfsserver

# Default compression is true
#Compression = true

# chunksize is 64M

# Number of threads for compression/decompression: default=2
#CompThreads = 2

#Mount point for the ramfs file for mmap

#Duplicate Request cache size & timeout in seconds
#DrCacheSize = 20480
#DrCacheTimeout = 62
# To keep the drcache lean, we only cache the response if the
# time we took to populate is greater than 50% of DrCacheTimeout.
# Set it to 0 to disable this optimization, Note that the DrCacheSize or
# DrCacheTimeout will also need to be changed. Ex: if the nfsserver supports
# 10,000 ops/sec (modification ops): then DrCacheSize will need to change
# to: 10,000*DrCacheTimeout = 620,000
#DRCacheTimeOutOpt = 0.5

#NFS fileid, by default the fileid is of 32 bit size.
#Set Use32BitFileId=0 to use 64 bit fileid (inode number)
#Use32BitFileId=0

#Auto refresh exports time interval in mins.
#default is 0, means there is no auto refresh.
