Glossary

   This section contains defintions for commonly used terms in MapR
   Converged Data Platform environments.

   Term

   Definition

   .dfs_attributes

   A special file in every directory, for controlling the compression and
   chunk size used for the directory and its subdirectories.

   .rw

   A special mount point in the root-level volume (or read-only mirror)
   that points to the writable original copy of the volume.

   .snapshot

   A special directory in the top level of each volume, containing all the
   snapshots for that volume.
   access control expression (ACE) A Boolean expression that defines a
   combination of users, groups, or roles that have access to an object
   stored natively such as a directory, file, or MapR-DB table .

   access control list (ACL)

   A list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies users or
   system processes that can perform specific actions on an object.

   accounting entity (AE)

   A clearly defined economics unit that is accounted for separately.

   advisory quota

   An advisory disk capacity limit that can be set for a volume, user, or
   group. When disk usage exceeds the advisory quota, an alert is sent.

   application containers
   Lightweight, stand-alone executables that include verything needed to
   run an application. Application containers are typically available for
   Linux and Windows applications.

   bitmask

   A binary number in which each bit controls a single toggle.

   chunk

   Files in MapR-FS are split into chunks (similar to Hadoop blocks) that
   are normally 256 MB by default. Any multiple of 65,536 bytes is a valid
   chunk size, but tuning the size correctly is important. Files inherit
   the chunk size settings of the directory that contains them, as do
   subdirectories on which chunk size has not been explicitly set. Any
   files written by a Hadoop application, whether via the file APIs or
   over NFS, use chunk size specified by the settings for the directory
   where the file is written.

   container

   The unit of shared storage in a MapR cluster. Every container is either
   a [1]name container or a [2]data container.
   See also:
     * application containers
     * Docker containers
     * YARN resource containers

   container location database (CLDB)

   A service, running on one or more MapR nodes, that maintains the
   locations of services, containers, and other cluster information.

   data container

   One of the two types of containers in a MapR cluster. Data containers
   typically have a cascaded configuration (master replicates to replica1,
   replica1 replicates to replica2, and so on). Every data container is
   either a master container, an intermediate container, or a tail
   container depending on its replication role.

   desired replication factor

   The number of copies of a volume that should be maintained by the MapR
   cluster for normal operation. When the number of copies falls below the
   desired replication factor, but remains equal to or above the
   [3]minimum replication factor, re-replication occurs after the timeout
   specified in the [4]cldb.fs.mark.rereplicate.sec parameter.

   disk space balancer

   The disk space balancer is a tool that balances disk space usage on a
   cluster by moving containers between storage pools. Whenever a storage
   pool is over 70% full (or a threshold defined by the
   cldb.balancer.disk.threshold.percentage parameter), the disk space
   balancer distributes containers to other storage pools that have lower
   utilization than the average for that cluster. The disk space balancer
   aims to ensure that the percentage of space used on all of the disks in
   the node is similar.

   disktab

   A file on each node, containing a list of the node's disks that have
   been configured for use by MapR-FS.
   Docker containers The application containers used by Docker software.
   Docker is a leading proponent of OS virtualization using application
   containers ("containerization").

   dump file

   A file containing data from a volume for distribution or restoration.
   There are two types of dump files: full dump files containing all data
   in a volume, and incremental dump files that contain changes to a
   volume between two points in time.

   entity

   A user or group. Users and groups can represent [5]accounting entities.

   full dump file

   See [6]dump file.

   epoch

   A sequence number that identifies all copies that have the latest
   updates for a container. The larger the number, the most up-to-date the
   copy of the container. The CLDB uses the epoch to ensure that an
   out-of-date copy cannot become the master for the container.

   HBase

   A distributed storage system, designed to scale to a very large size,
   for managing massive amounts of structured data. Apache HBase is
   deprecated.

   heartbeat

   A signal sent by each FileServer and NFS node every second to provide
   information to the CLDB about the node's health and resource usage.

   incremental dump file

   See [7]dump file.
   MapR Expansion Pack (MEP) A selected set of stable, interoperable, and
   widely used components from the Hadoop Ecosystem that are fully
   supported on the MapR platform. MEPs can include connectors and
   developer APIs that provide common Hadoop Ecosystem interfaces to MapR
   components (for example, Kafka Connect).

   MapR-FS

   The NFS-mountable, distributed, high-performance MapR data storage
   system.

   minimum replication factor

   The minimum number of copies of a volume that should be maintained by
   the MapR cluster for normal operation. When the replication factor
   falls below this minimum, re-replication occurs as aggressively as
   possible to restore the replication level. If any containers in the
   CLDB volume fall below the minimum replication factor, writes are
   disabled until aggressive re-replication restores the minimum level of
   replication.

   mirror

   A read-only physical copy of a volume.

   name container

   A container in a MapR cluster that holds a volume's namespace
   information and file chunk locations, and the first 64 KB of each file
   in the volume.

   Network File System (NFS)

   A protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over
   a network as though they were stored locally.

   node

   An individual server (physical or virtual machine) in a cluster.
   Persistent Application Client Container (PACC) A Docker-based
   application container image that includes a container-optimized MapR
   client. The PACC provides seamless access to MapR Converged Data
   Platform services, including MapR-FS, MapR-DB, and MapR-ES.
   The PACC makes it fast and easy to run containerized applications that
   access data in MapR.

   quota

   A disk capacity limit that can be set for a volume, user, or group.
   When disk usage exceeds the quota, no more data can be written.

   recovery point objective (RPO)

   The maximum allowable data loss as a point in time. If the recovery
   point objective is 2 hours, then the maximum allowable amount of data
   loss that is acceptable is 2 hours of work.

   recovery time objective (RTO)

   The maximum allowable time to recovery after data loss. If the recovery
   time objective is 5 hours, then it must be possible to restore data up
   to the recovery point objective within 5 hours. See also [8]recovery
   point objective

   replication factor

   The number of copies of a volume.

   replication role

   The replication role of a container determines how that container is
   replicated to other storage pools in the cluster. A [9]name container
   may have one of two replication roles: master or replica. A [10]data
   container may have one of three replication roles: master,
   intermediate, or tail.

   replication role balancer

   The replication role balancer is a tool that switches the replication
   roles of containers to ensure that every node has an equal share of of
   master and replica containers (for name containers) and an equal share
   of master, intermediate, and tail containers (for data containers).

   re-replication

   Re-replication occurs whenever the number of available replica
   containers drops below the number prescribed by that volume's
   replication factor. Re-replication may occur for a variety of reasons
   including replica container corruption, node unavailability, hard disk
   failure, or an increase in replication factor.

   schedule

   A group of rules that specify recurring points in time at which certain
   actions are determined to occur.

   snapshot

   A read-only logical image of a volume at a specific point in time.

   storage pool

   A unit of storage made up of one or more disks. By default, MapR
   storage pools contain two or three disks. For high-volume reads and
   writes, you can create larger storage pools when initially formatting
   storage during cluster creation.

   stripe width

   The number of disks in a [11]storage pool.

   super group

   The group that has administrative access to the MapR cluster.

   super user

   The user that has administrative access to the MapR cluster.

   volume

   A tree of files and directories grouped for the purpose of applying a
   policy or set of policies to all of them at once.

   Warden

   A MapR process that coordinates the starting and stopping of configured
   services on a node.
   YARN resource containers A unit of memory allocated for use by YARN to
   process each map or reduce task.
