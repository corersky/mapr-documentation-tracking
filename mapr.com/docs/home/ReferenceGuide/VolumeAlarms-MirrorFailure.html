Mirror Failure

   UI Column
          Mirror Alarm

   Logged As
          VOLUME_ALARM_MIRROR_FAILURE

   Meaning
          A mirror operation failed.

   Resolution
          Make sure the CLDB is running on both the source cluster and the
          destination cluster. Look at the CLDB log
          (/opt/mapr/logs/cldb.log) and the MapR file system log
          (/opt/mapr/logs/mfs.log) on both clusters for more information.
          If the attempted mirror operation was between two clusters, make
          sure that both clusters are reachable over the network. Make
          sure the source volume is available and reachable from the
          cluster that is performing the mirror operation. For more
          troubleshooting information, see [1]how to handle this alarm.
