zoo.cfg

   The file /opt/mapr/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.5/conf/zoo.cfg specifies
   ZooKeeper configuration parameters.
   Example
# The number of milliseconds of each tick
tickTime=2000
# The number of ticks that the initial
# synchronization phase can take
initLimit=20
# The number of ticks that can pass between
# sending a request and getting an acknowledgement
syncLimit=10
# the directory where the snapshot is stored.
dataDir=/var/mapr-zookeeper-data
# the port at which the clients will connect
clientPort=5181
# max number of client connections
maxClientCnxns=100

   Warning: maxClientCnxns limits the number of concurrent ZooKeeper
   connections that a single client machine may make. This value does not
   set a limit for the whole cluster. The default is 100. If you plan to
   run more than 100 jobs from a single node, increase this value.
