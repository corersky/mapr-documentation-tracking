mrconfig sp offline all

   The mrconfig sp offline all command takes all of a node's loaded
   storage pools offline. When a storage pool is offline it remains loaded
   into memory, but it is not available to MapR file system for reads and
   writes.

   The main use of the mrconfig sp offline all command is to take all
   storage pools on a node offline so the [1]fsck (filesystem check)
   command can be run on disks or storage pools if there are lost or
   corrupt containers, directories, tables, files, filelets, or blocks.

   After running [2]fsck the storage pools are brought back online with
   the [3]mrconfig sp online command, and then typically the [4]gfsck
   (global filesystem check) command would be run on the affected cluster,
   volumes, or snapshots.

   See [5]mrconfig for instructions on running mrconfig commands.
