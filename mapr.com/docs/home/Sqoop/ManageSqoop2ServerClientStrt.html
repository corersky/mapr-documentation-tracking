Starting the Sqoop2 Command Line Client

   The Sqoop install directory (<SQOOP_INSTALL_DIR>) is of the form
   /opt/mapr/sqoop/sqoop-<version_number>.
     * To start the sqoop2 command line client without MapR-SASL
       authentication, enter:
$ cd <SQOOP_INSTALL_DIR>
$ ./bin/sqoop.sh client
       When Sqoop2 does not use MapR-SASL, any user that has access to run
       jobs on the cluster can start the Sqoop2 client.
     * To start the Sqoop2 command line client with MapR-SASL
       authentication, enter:

       the Sqoop2 client.
