Sqoop2

   Sqoop2 transfers bulk data between Hadoop and various types of
   structured datastores, such as relational databases, enterprise data
   warehouses, and NoSQL systems. Sqoop2 is installed and configured
   server-side. When you install the Sqoop2 server package, the Sqoop2
   client package is installed as well.

   Sqoop2 can be used in conjunction with Hue, which is a web-based GUI
   that facilitates the importing and exporting of data from these
   structured datastores. This illustration shows how a user can access
   Sqoop2 from a browser, such as Hue.

   This documentation provides all relevant details about using Sqoop2
   with MapR, but does not duplicate Apache documentation. You can refer
   also to documentation available from the [1]Apache Sqoop website.
   Note: Sqoop2 does not officially support HA.
