Sqoop

   [sqoop_logo.png]

   Apache Sqoopâ„¢ is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data
   between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational
   databases.

   This documentation provides all relevant details about using Sqoop and
   Sqoop2 with MapR, but does not duplicate Apache documentation. You can
   refer also to documentation available from the [1]Apache Sqoop website.

   The following table describes the differences between [2]Sqoop1 or
   [3]Sqoop2:

   CAPTION:

   Feature Sqoop1 Sqoop2
   Specialized connectors for all major RDBMS Available.

   Not available. However, you can use the generic-jdbc-connector , which
   has been tested on these databases:
     * MySQL
     * Microsoft SQL Server
     * Oracle (Not supported in Sqoop 1.99.7)
     * PostgreSQL

   The generic JDBC connector should also work with any other
   JDBC-compliant database, although specialized connectors probably give
   better performance.
   Data transfer from RDBMS to Hive Done automatically.

   Must be done manually in two stages:
    1. Import data from RDBMS into MapR Filesystem.
    2. Load data into Hive using the LOAD DATA command
       Note: As of Sqoop 1.99.7, you can also use the kite-connector to
       load data into Hive.

   Data transfer from Hive to RDBMS

   Must be done manually in two stages:
    1. Extract data from Hive into MapR Filesystem, as a text file or as
       an Avro file.
    2. Export the output of step 1 to an RDBMS using Sqoop.

   Integrated Kerberos security Supported. Supported.
