Verifying SSL Security for HttpFS

   You need to run curl commands to verify that HTTPS is enabled for
   HttpFS.
   Run one of the following curl commands to check that HTTPS is enabled.
   These commands fetch the file some_file.txt from MapR file system under
   /user/mapr and attempt to open it securely over HTTPS.
     * To check if HTTPS is enabled, run the following command (which
       differs for non-secure and secure clusters):
          + For non-secure clusters:
curl -k "https://localhost:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/mapr/some_file.txt?op=open&user
.name=mapr"
          + For secure clusters:
curl -u <user_name> -k
 "https://localhost:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/mapr/some_file.txt?op=open"
     * If you configured Hue to use SSL encryption with certificate-based
       authentication for communication with HttpFS, run the following
       command (which differs for non-secure and secure clusters):
          + For non-secure clusters:
curl -k
 --cert /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/cert.pem
 --key /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/hue_private_keystore.pem
 "https://localhost:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/mapr/some_file.txt?op=open&user.name=m
apr"
          + For secure clusters:
curl -u <user_name> -k
--cert /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/cert.pem
--key /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/hue_private_keystore.pem
"https://localhost:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/mapr/some_file.txt?op=open"
