PAM Authentication for HttpFS

   Complete the following steps to enable PAM authentication for HttpFS.
    1. Add the following properties to the
       /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/etc/hadoop/httpfs-site.xml file.
<property>
        <name>httpfs.hadoop.authentication.type</name>
        <value>multiauth</value>
</property>

<property>
        <name>httpfs.authentication.type</name>
        <value>multiauth</value>
</property>
       Note: On secure clusters, the multiauth authentication is enabled
       by default.
    2. Restart the HttpFS service.
sudo -u mapr /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/sbin/httpfs.sh stop
sudo -u mapr /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/sbin/httpfs.sh start
    3. Run cURL with the PUT operation as shown in this example after
       restarting the service.
       Note: If HttpFS is configured with plain authentication through
       PAM, the cURL request must contain a username and password.
curl -X PUT "http://mapr:mapr@node1:14000/webhdfs/v1/tmp/example?op=mkdirs"
