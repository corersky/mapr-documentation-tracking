Preparing to Enable SSL Security for HttpFS

   To enable SSL security for HttpFS, you need to use ssl_keystore and
   ssl_truststore, which are generated automatically for a secure cluster
   in /opt/mapr/conf/. When using SSL on non-secure clusters, you need to
   manually generate keystore and truststore.
    1. To preserve the original version, rename the existing server.xml
       file
       (/opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/server
       .xml) to server.xml.orig.
sudo cp /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/server.xml
/opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/server.xml.orig
    2. Replace the contents of server.xml with the contents of
       server.xml.https.
sudo cp /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/server.xml.h
ttps
/opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/server.xml
    3. To enable SSL without certificate-based authentication, set the
       clientAuth attribute to "false" and set properties related to
       keystore and truststore (on a secure cluster, the defaults are
       already set properly) in server.xml
       (/opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/share/hadoop/httpfs/tomcat/conf/server
       .xml).
       For example:
<Connector port="${httpfs.http.port}" SSLEnabled="true"
maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
keystoreFile="/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore"
keystorePass="<ssl-keystore-password>"
truststoreFile="/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore"
truststorePass="<ssl-keystore-password>"/>
