Step 3: Modify the httpfs-site.xml File

   MapR provides a Kerberos-ready version of the httpfs-site.xml file
   called httpfs-site.xml.kerberos. This file resides in
   /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/etc/hadoop. You must edit this file and
   specify the kerberos principal name for the nodes where you are running
   HttpFS, restart the HttpFS server, and then you can test the set-up.
   Each step is explained here.

   To set up the httpfs-site.xml file for each node running the HttpFS
   service, follow these steps:
    1. Assign a new name to the existing httpfs-site.xml file (to preserve
       the original version when the file gets overwritten in step 2).
cp /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/etc/hadoop httpfs-site.xml httpfs-site.xml.origin
al
    2. Copy the kerberos version (httpfs-site.xml.kerberos) to the
       existing httpfs-site.xml file.
cp /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/etc/hadoop httpfs-site.xml.kerberos httpfs-site.x
ml
    3. Edit the httpfs-site.xml file and insert the principal name as
       shown, substituting your fully qualified domain name and realm for
       perfnode153.perf.lab@mapr.com.
<property>
  <name>
    httpfs.authentication.kerberos.principal
  </name>
  <value>
    HTTP/perfnode153.perf.lab@mapr.com
  </value>
</property>
    4. Restart the HttpFS server so the changes will take effect.
maprcli node services -name httpfs -action restart -nodes <node_name>
    5. Test that security is in place by entering the following command to
       create a file in MapR-FS. The command will fail if security is not
       set up correctly.
curl --negotiate -u : -b ~/cookiejar.txt -c ~/cookiejar.txt -i -X PUT
"http://perfnode153.perf.lab:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/mapr/some_file?op=MKDIRS"
