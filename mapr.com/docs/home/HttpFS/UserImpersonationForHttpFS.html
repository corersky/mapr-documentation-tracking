User Impersonation for HttpFS

   You can set up proxy user functionality if you want HttpFS to
   impersonate a user from a set of hosts, or to impersonate a user that
   belongs to a set of groups. When you configure proxy user
   functionality, the proxy user can perform “doAs” operations. Add
   configuration properties to the httpfs-site.xml and core-site.xml files
   to configure proxy user functionality.
   Complete the following steps to configure user impersonation for
   HttpFS:
    1. Add the following configuration properties to the
       httpfs-site-site.xml file:
          + httpfs.proxyuser.#USER#.hosts
          + httpfs.proxyuser.#USER#.groups
    2. Replace #USER# with the username of the proxy that can perform
       “doAs” operations. For the host property, you can add a list of
       host names as the value. For the group property, you can add a list
       of groups as the value. Alternatively, you can add a wildcard
       character (*) as the value for host and group properties. To add
       multiple users, copy the property and replace #USER# with the proxy
       user name.
       Host Example
<property>
        <name>httpfs.proxyuser.mapr.hosts</name>
        <value>*</value>
</property>
       Group Example
<property>
        <name>httpfs.proxyuser.mapr.groups</name>
        <value>*</value>
</property>

   To use impersonation, issue a cURL command with the
   doas=<impersonated_user's name> parameter.

   Example 1

   Where user.name is mapr and doas (or the impersonated user's name) is
   sampleusername.
curl -i -X PUT -T one
"http://<node_name>:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/mapr/TEST/one
?op=CREATE&user.name=mapr&doas=sampleusername&data=true"
-H "Content-Type:application/octet-stream"

   Example 2

   For any user (and password) other than the mapr user (for example,
   test_user1), set the following property in the
   /opt/mapr/httpfs/httpfs-1.0/etc/hadoop/httpfs-site.xml file:
<property>
          <name>hadoop.proxyuser.<test_user1>.hosts</name>
          <value>*</value>
</property>

   Run cURL.

   Where trueuser.name is test_user1 and doas (or the impersonated user's
   name) is test_user2.
curl -u fred -i -X PUT -T /etc/hosts --header "Content-Type:application/octet-st
ream"
"http://<node_name>:14000/webhdfs/v1/<path_to_test_file>
?op=CREATE&doas=<test_user2>&data=true&user.name=<test_user1>"
