SSL Security for HttpFS

   Use this procedure with MapR 6.0 and earlier to explicitly enable
   security on HttpFS. Although SSL for HttpFS is enabled by default on
   secure clusters in MapR 6.0.1, you must manually configure it in MapR
   6.0 and earlier, including whether you want it to use certificate-based
   authentication or not.
   You also need to enable SSL if [1]custom security is enabled.
