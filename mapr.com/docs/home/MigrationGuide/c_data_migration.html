Data Migration

   After you migrate your applications to the MapR cluster, you can copy
   your data from the Apache Hadoop HDFS to the MapR cluster.

   Once you have installed and configured your MapR cluster in a test
   environment and migrated your applications to the MapR cluster you can
   begin to copy over your data from the Apache Hadoop HDFS to the MapR
   cluster.

   Use any of the following methods to copy data from an HDFS cluster to a
   MapR cluster:
   Method Description
   hdfs:// protocol You can use the hadoop distcp command with the hdfs://
   protocol to copy data from an HDFS cluster into a MapR cluster. Use
   this method if the HDFS cluster and the MapR cluster use the same RPC
   protocol version. For all other scenarios, use the webhdfs:// protocol
   or NFS gateway to copy data to a MapR cluster.
   webhdfs:// protocol You can use the hadoop distcp command with the
   webhdfs:// protocol to copy data from an HDFS cluster into a MapR
   cluster.
   NFS You can mount a MapR cluster to an HDFS cluster via NFS mount and
   then use the hadoop distcp command to copy data between the two
   clusters.
