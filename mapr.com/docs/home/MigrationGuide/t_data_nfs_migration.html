Using NFS

   This section describes how to copy data from an HDFS cluster to a MapR
   cluster using NFS.

   If NFS is installed on the MapR cluster, you can mount the MapR cluster
   to the HDFS cluster and then copy files from one cluster to the other
   using hadoop distcp. If you do not have NFS installed and a mount point
   configured, see [1]Accessing Data with NFS and [2]Setting Up MapR NFS.

   To perform a copy using distcp via NFS, you need the following
   information:
     * <MapR NFS Server>: the IP address or hostname of the NFS server in
       the MapR cluster
     * <maprfs_nfs_mount>: the NFS export mount point configured on the
       MapR cluster; default is /mapr
     * <hdfs_nfs_mount>: the NFS mount point configured on the HDFS
       cluster
     * <NameNode>: the IP address or hostname of the NameNode in the HDFS
       cluster
     * <NameNode Port>: the port on the NameNode in the HDFS cluster
     * <HDFS path>: the path to the HDFS directory from which you plan to
       copy data
     * <MapR-FS path>: the path in the MapR cluster to which you plan to
       copy HDFS data

   To copy data from HDFS to MapR Filesystem using NFS, complete the
   following steps:
    1. Issue the following command to mount the MapR cluster to the HDFS
       NFS mount point:
mount <MapR NFS Server>:/<maprfs_nfs_mount> /<hdfs_nfs_mount>
       For example:
mount 10.10.100.175:/mapr /hdfsmount
    2. Issue the following command to copy data from the HDFS cluster to
       the MapR cluster:
hadoop distcp hdfs://<NameNode>:<NameNode Port>/<HDFS path> file:///<hdfs_nfs_mo
unt>/<MapR-FS path>
       For example:
hadoop distcp hdfs://nn1:8020/user/sara/file.txt file:///hdfsmount/user/sara
    3. Issue the following command from the MapR cluster to verify that
       the file was copied to the MapR cluster:
hadoop fs -ls /<MapR-FS path>
       For example:
hadoop fs -ls /user/sara
