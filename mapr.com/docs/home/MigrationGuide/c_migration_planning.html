Planning and Initial Deployment

   There are a number of considerations to take into account before
   migrating from Apache Hadoop to MapR Hadoop.

   The first phase of migration is planning. In this phase you will
   identify the requirements and goals of the migration, identify
   potential issues in the migration, and define a strategy.

   The requirements and goals of the migration depend on a number of
   factors:
     * Data migration: can you move your datasets individually, or must
       the data be moved all at once?
     * Downtime: can you tolerate downtime, or is it important to complete
       the migration with no interruption in service?
     * Customization: what custom patches or applications are running on
       the cluster?
     * Storage: is there enough space to store the data during the
       migration?

   The MapR Hadoop distribution is 100% plug-and-play compatible with
   Apache Hadoop, so you do not need to make changes to your applications
   to run them on a MapR cluster. MapR Hadoop automatically configures
   compression and memory settings, task heap sizes, and local volumes for
   shuffle data.

Initial Deployment

   The initial MapR deployment phase consists of installing, configuring,
   and testing the MapR cluster and any ecosystem components (such as Hive
   or Pig) on an initial set of nodes. Once you have the MapR cluster
   deployed, you will be able to begin migrating data and applications.

   To deploy the MapR cluster on the selected nodes, see the [1]Installing
   MapR and/or MapR Ecosystem Components
