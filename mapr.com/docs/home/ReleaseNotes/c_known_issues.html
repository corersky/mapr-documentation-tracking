Upgrade Issues

   MAPRYARN-129
          Issue: For some clusters that are upgraded from MapR 6.0.1 to
          6.1.0, using any Hadoop command generates the following
          java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:

          This issue only affects clusters that use scheduler debug
          logging as described in 31038 of [3]Known Issues at Release
          (MapR 6.0.1). The issue occurs because the
          hadoop-yarn-common-2.7.0-mapr-1808.jar in MapR 6.1.0 does not
          contain the org.apache.hadoop.yarn.WorldWritableLogAppender Java
          class.

          Workaround: Remove the following lines from the
          /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/log4j.properties file:

yarn.debug.controller.logger = INFO, ED
yarn.debug.controller.log.file=yarn-mapr-scheduling-debug.log
yarn.debug.controller.log.maxfilesize=256MB
yarn.debug.controller.log.maxbackupindex=20

          Issue: Using the configure.sh -R command after an upgrade from
          5.2.x to 6.0 or later can return error messages for some MapR
          Monitoring components. For example:

/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R

-OT "ip:port,ip1:port,"

          These errors are generated because a newer version of the server
          configure.sh uses certain options that do not exist with older
          ecosystem components.

          Workaround: None. The upgrade can succeed in spite of the
          errors, and the current ecosystem configuration is left
          unchanged. The error messages can be ignored.

Indexing and MapR Drill

   MD-2218 (previously 28041)
          Running multiple queries in sequence can cause Drillbits to run
          out of direct memory. Limiting records in large batches to 5KB
          may prevent this issue from occurring. Should Drill return an
          out of memory exception, issue the following command to restart
          the Drillbits:

$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <node host names
 separated by a space>

   28096
          If you use the Google Guava library in your application and
          encounter the following error:

Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.google.common.base.Stopwatch.createS
tarted()Lcom/google/common/base/Stopwatch;

          You must use version 18.0 of the library. If you use Maven, you
          can use the following dependency:

            <dependency>
              <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
              <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
              <version>18.0</version>
              </dependency>

MapR Database

   MAPRDB-1375
          If you have a MapR Database JSON table with multiple column
          families and the table has a secondary index, after you perform
          a series of update operations (for example: set, increment,
          decrement, replace, append, etc.) on the table, the index may
          have duplicate rows.

   MAPRDB-1520
          If you have an OR condition that references a container field
          path more than once, and MapR Database uses an index to process
          the query, then the query may return incorrect results. You can
          workaround this problem by forcing MapR Database to not use
          indexes. See [4]Forcing Secondary Index Usage in OJAI for
          details.

   27057
          When you issue a maprcli table changelog add command, during the
          initial sync when the existing data is copied to the change log,
          the end-to-end latency during the initial 5 minutes can be high.
          After the initial sync, latency will be small, specifically 2-4
          seconds.

MapR Client

   23624
          The same MapR client can access both secure and nonsecure
          clusters; however, a MapR client that is configured to access a
          secure cluster can access a nonsecure cluster only if these
          conditions are met:

          + The secure cluster must be listed first in mapr-clusters.conf.
          + A user must obtain a ticket for the secure cluster even if the
            user wants to access only the nonsecure cluster.

MapR Control System

   MON-4891
          Description: The MCS displays an Oops error on the Admin > User
          Settings > SMTP page when the mapr.smtp.provider is not any of
          the 3 allowed options (Gmail, Office 365, SMTP). This impacts
          all upgrade from 5.x to 6.x where your SMTP provider setting is
          "other".
          Resolution: Run the following command to resolve this error if
          your SMTP provider is not Gmail or Office 365:

maprcli config save -values {"mapr.smtp.provider":"smtp"}

          If your SMTP provider is Office 365, run the following command:

maprcli config save -values {"mapr.smtp.provider":"office"}

   MON-4862
          Description: The MCS does not start after an upgrade to MapR 6.1
          if the installed license does not have table support enabled.
          See [5]Support Portal for additional information.

   MON-4788
          Description: When running large number of table (get, scan,
          index) operations, the API server may become unresponsive and
          you may see following error: GC overhead limit exceeded.
          Resolution: Check the heap size and increase it based on
          available system resources or set up a load balancer to
          distribute the HTTP requests (load) to other API servers. To
          increase heap size:

         1. Open /opt/mapr/apiserver/bin/mapr-apiserver.sh file.
         2. Modify the value for JVMXMS and JVMXMX (under JVM tuning).
            For example, modify the following in the file:
# JVM tuning
JVMXMS=${JVMXMS:-1024m}
JVMXMX=${JVMXMX:-1024m}
         3. Save and close the file.
         4. Restart apiserver for the changes to take effect.
            For example, run the following command to restart the
            apiserver:
maprcli node services -action restart -name apiserver -nodes `hostname`

   MON-4776
          Description: You cannot mount or unmount multiple volumes at the
          same time by selecting them from different pages in the Volumes
          pane (of the Data > Volumes page).
          Workaround: Increase the number of rows, if possible, in the
          Volumes pane and select the volumes from the same page to mount
          or unmount.

   MON-4701
          Description: The table metrics list view displays metric values
          calculated using endTime-startTime. If you select a time range
          like Today, This Week, This Month, where the end time is in the
          future, no data is displayed in the columns.
          Workaround: Choose Today so far, This week so far, This month so
          far instead to view the most current data.

   MON-3817
          Description: The Node Health by Topology pane does not reflect
          the most recent topology of the node if the node was just moved
          to a different/new topology.
          Workaround: Navigate to another tab or page and then return to
          the page to view the updated topology for the node in the Node
          Health by Topology pane.

   MON-3709
          Description: The list of services in the Services page do not
          refresh per the configured refresh rate settings.
          Workaround: To view the latest status for the services, reload
          the page in the browser.

   MON-3476
          Issue:In the MapR Control System, table permissions can only be
          modified by the owner/creator of the table.
          Workaround: User, who is not the owner but has table admin
          permissions, must use the CLI to modify table permissions.

   MON-3452
          Issue: After selecting the Include System Volumes checkbox to
          display system volumes in the Volumes list pane, if you set
          quota (using the link in the Quota column), the system volumes
          are no longer displayed in the list of volumes even though the
          system volumes checkbox is still selected.
          Workaround: Deselect and then re-select the Include System
          Volumes checkbox to display the system volumes in the list of
          volumes.

   MON-3438
          Issue: You may experience some latency in the Admin > Cluster
          Settings > Alarms page when you click the name of an alarm to
          display the Alarm Settings window for the alarm.

   MON-3425
          Issue: When you filter the list of alarms in the Alarms summary
          page, the page does not refresh and display the correct list of
          alarms if there are muted alarms.

   MON-3407
          Issue: If you are upgrading from a pre-6.0 version, the MapR
          Control System might display 0 instances of webserver running in
          the Services page. This is because starting from v6.0, the UI
          static files are in mapr-webserver and the mapr-apiserver runs
          the server that sends the queries. For more information on
          webserver in v6.0, see [6]Setting Up the MapR Control System.

   MON-3404
          Issue: The topic search field in the Stream (detail) > Topic tab
          does not display correctly in Firefox.
          Workaround: Use Chrome (v58 and later) to perform a topic
          search.

   MON-3247
          Issue: The MapR Control System does not display NFS edge nodes
          and POSIX client nodes that are currently connected to the
          cluster when you sort the list of nodes by topology.
          Workaround: Use the [7]node list command to retrieve the list of
          client nodes currently connected to the cluster.

   MON-2409
          Issue: When you try to navigate to another cluster by clicking
          on the cluster name from the dropdown list at the top of the
          page, the Overview page for the current cluster displays and it
          takes a few minutes to display the MCS login page for the other
          cluster.

   MON-2374
          Issue: If a node has multiple IP addresses, the log viewer link
          for the services in the nodes information page is broken because
          the Kibana URL contains multiple IP addresses.
          Workaround: Remove all irrelevant IP addresses in the URL and
          use the modified URL to view logs for the service.

   MON-2321
          Issue: If Elasticsearch fails, the Services page does not show
          the nodes on which Elasticsearch has failed.

   MON-2219
          Issue: If you add Streams license separately, you may not be
          able to view the Streams page.
          Workaround: Contact MapR Support.

   MON-2218
          Issue: When you preserve snapshots, there is no notification
          (success message) or indication (Expires On column still does
          not show No Expiration) even though the operation succeeded.
          Workaround: Refresh the page after preserving a snapshot to see
          the No Expiration setting in the Expires On column.

   MON-2076
          Issue: When you select topics to remove, deselect all the topics
          in the Remove Topic confirmation window and click Cancel, then
          select a topic in the page by clicking on the checkbox, the
          Remove Topic window opens again even if you did not click on the
          Remove Topic button.
          Workaround: Refresh the page.

   MON-2018
          Issue: In the Add Change Log page, after entering field to add
          in the Publish Selected Field Path text field, the Add Field
          button is disabled.
          Workaround: Click outside the text field to enable the Add Field
          button.

   MON-2011
          Issue: When adding or editing the compression setting on a
          replica, selecting Inherited does not have any effect. The
          default value is lz4.
          Workaround: Do not select Inherited as the compression setting
          on a replica.

   MON-2009
          Issue: When modifying replica of a binary table with three or
          more column families, if you select different set of columns to
          replicate for different column families, the operation might
          result in an error.

   MON-1994
          Issue: If you adjust the system time, the time stamp associated
          with the alarm in the Active Alarms pane might show negative
          value.

   MON-1968
          Issue: In the User Disk Usage page, you cannot remove the email
          address after setting an email address for an entity by editing
          the properties.

   MON-1929
          Issue: The Save Changes button in the Access Control Expression
          builder page is disabled after entering user, group, or role
          name in text field.
          Workaround: Click outside the field to enable the Save Changes
          button.

   MON-1810
          Issue: When editing multiple volumes, you cannot undo changes to
          Auditing and Accountable Entity fields by clicking
          [revertChange.png] .

   MON-1755
          Issue: When creating a mirror volume, after entering the name of
          the source volume on the remote cluster and selecting the remote
          cluster on which the volume resides, you may see an error that
          the source volume does not exist.
          Workaround: Re-enter the name of the source volume on the remote
          cluster.

   MON-1221
          Issue: In the Alarm Settings window, if you click the cursor in
          the Additional email recipients text field and then press the
          return/enter key in the keyboard without entering an email
          address, the Cluster Settings page displays once again.

MapR Monitoring

   OTSDB-72
          Issue: The memory allocated to OpenTSDB can be insufficient,
          resulting in empty graphs and out-of-memory or GC overhead limit
          exceeded errors.
          Workaround: Increase the default memory for OpenTSDB by making
          the following changes on all OpenTSDB nodes:

         1. Edit the /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.opentsdb.conf file to
            change:
service.heapsize.max=2000
service.heapsize.min=2000
            to
service.heapsize.max=6000
service.heapsize.min=6000
         2. Edit the /opt/mapr/opentsdb/opentsdb-*/etc/init.d/opentsdb
            file to change:
$
{JVMXMX:=-Xmx2000m -Xss1m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m}
            to
$
{JVMXMX:=-Xmx6000m -Xss1m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m}
         3. Restart the OpenTSDB service:
maprcli node services -name opentsdb -nodes <space-separated list of OpenTSDB no
des> -action restart

   SPYG-994
          Issue: The time-to-live for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
          metrics is fixed at 30 days and cannot be reduced to lower disk
          space usage.

   SPYG-934
          Issue: On secure Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 clusters, Elasticsearch
          fails to generate a keystore password if the uuid-runtime
          package is not installed. uuid-runtime is one of the [8]MapR
          Installer prerequisites.
          Workaround: Install the uuid-runtime package from the default
          Ubuntu repository:

apt-get install uuid-runtime

MapR PACC

   See [9]MapR PACC Known Issues.

NFSv4

   32364
          Issue: Any running IO on NFSv4 mount (with kerberos) is stuck if
          the krb5 ticket expires for the current user. The mount point
          also hangs and becomes inaccessible.
          Workaround: Restart rpcgssd service with the new ticket to make
          the mount point accessible and re-trigger the IO to proceed.

Oozie

   29634
          Issue: On a secure cluster, Oozie jobs can fail when the
          timeline server for the Hive-on-Tez user interface is configured
          with MapR-SASL.
          Workaround: Restart the resource manager and timeline server.
          For more information, see [10]Configuring the Timeline Server to
          Use the Hive-on-Tez User Interface.

PJDTest Suite Compliance

   28912
          Issue: When trying to open a FIFO on a FUSE mounted filesystem,
          permissions to perform the operation are not checked.

   29234
          Issue: The FUSE-based POSIX can only trace at millisecond level
          and the test suite utimensat in pjdtestsuite fails because the
          test suite sets time in nanoseconds.

   29237
          Issue: Any user can set time using touch -t for any file on a
          FUSE mounted filesystem.

Timeline Server
