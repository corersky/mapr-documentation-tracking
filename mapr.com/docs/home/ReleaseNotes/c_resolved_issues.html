Resolved Issues

   The following MapR issues, which were reported by customers, are
   resolved in Version 6.1.
   Component Number Description Resolution
   Upgrade 31038 Prior to 6.1, the log4j.properties file was not
   automatically updated in an upgrade. All files update automatically.
   Upgrade 29752 Priort to 6.1, if Oozie was not upgraded to the MEP4.0.0
   version, the Oozie process would fail following a manual upgrade from
   MapR 5.2.x/MEP3.0.1 to MapR 6.0. The upgrade process works correctly.
   FileClient 31024 When hadoop fs -rmr command is run to remove a list of
   files/directories, if a file/directory is not present at the time of
   remove, the command returns an error, 'no such file or directoryâ€™, and
   terminates without removing remaining files and/or directories from the
   given list. When hadoop fs -rmr command is run to remove a list of
   files and/or directories, if a file/directory from the list is not
   present on the system, the command now removes remaining files and/or
   directories from the list.
   MCS MON-3325

   The MapR Control System does not display topologies with hostname (in
   the topology). You cannot configure node-specific topology for a volume
   from MCS.
   Hostname displays correctly.
   MON-3248

   The MapR Control System does not support filtering list of nodes by
   services running on client nodes.
   The MapR Control System supports filtering list of nodes by services
   running on client nodes.
   SPYG-1010

   The Grafana dashboard shows "No data points" for Volume metrics
   Dashboard entries are correct.
   SPYG-916 MapR monitoring index is not loaded correctly. Loads
   correctly.
   MapR Event Store for Apache Kafka 31074 [Kafka 1.0] incorrect behavior
   for offsetsForTimes when streams.rpc.timeout.ms is configured Behavior
   corrected for offsetsForTimes when streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   Elasticsearch ES-27 Elasticsearch fails to start correctly.
   Elasticsearch starts correctly.
   MapR Database 29278 Puts to tablets that failed with out of space
   errors, continue to fail on the first put, even though there is
   sufficient space; subsequent puts succeed. When space becomes
   available, the very first put no longer returns an error.
   30489 Client rpc trace messages for slow operations are not printing
   tablet fid. The messages include tablet fid.
   31092 MapR file system nodes are crashing when there is a burst of read
   requests. Corrected batching of read requests to avoid the condition
   that was causing the crash.
   31297 Using Python happyhbase module to scan a MapR Database table via
   HBase Thrift causes the Thrift server to hang. Addressed underlying
   issue that was causing the hang.
   31766 MapR file system node crash causes client RPC timeouts during get
   and put operations. Corrected the underlying logic for notification
   calls when creating new MapR Database buckets.
   31901 Memory corruption occurs when deleting/freeing memory Corrected
   race conditions that were causing the corruption.
   32262 Incremental bulkload via MapReduce fails to load data, even
   though it does not report an error. Corrected the underlying logic that
   was causing the incremental load to fail without returning an error.
   YARN 25473 Aggregated log is written with wrong ownership. Addressed
   the underlying issue that was causing writing the aggregated log to the
   wrong user.
   31082 ResourceManager address does not resolve after redirect via a
   proxy request. Fixed incorrect condition that decides to update the
   current ResourceManager address.
   31174 In the application master log, the following error repeatedly
   occurred: "Tez AM is trying to access Timeline server and it fails".
   TEZ AM is released after job or session is completed.
   31487 Containers fail in LOCALIZING state. Implemented clean up of
   subprocesses spawned by Shell when the process exits. Localization
   failures are available in the container diagnostics.
   31679 CVE-2016-6811 user who can escalate to Yarn user can possibly run
   arbitrary commands as a root user. Fixed the underlying security
   vulnerability.
   32178 Thread leak when executing a Scoop job. Fixed thread leak.
   32304 Fails to refresh labels for nodes in the cluster.
   DefaultContainerExecutor sets proper permissions.
