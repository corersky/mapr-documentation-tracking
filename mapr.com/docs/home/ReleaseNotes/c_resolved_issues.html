Resolved Issues

   The following MapR issues, which were reported by customers, are
   resolved in Version 6.1.
   Component Number Description Resolution
   CLDB 31346 Number of reysnc are large for an extended time after a
   couple of nodes are stopped/restarted in the cluster

   The issue occurs when there are a large number of snapshots on a
   cluster. There are new alarms to warn about this issue, and are
   configurable.
   See the following resources:
     * [1]Cluster Alarms
     * [2]cldb.conf
     * [3]Configuring the Alarm Threshold Using the CLI

   31620 Volume mirroring floods log with misleading error The bug occurs
   when mirroring happens between clusters that have both internal and
   external IPs set in mapr-clusters.conf. The getIPTypeForCluster method
   in CLDBRpcCommonUtils is unable to determine whether the IP type is
   internal or external. The workaround is to put in the internal IP in
   mapr-clusters.conf and keep the external IP in the env.sh file.

   Upgrade 31038 Prior to 6.1, the log4j.properties file was not
   automatically updated in an upgrade All files update automatically.
   Upgrade 29752 Prior to 6.1, if Oozie was not upgraded to the MEP4.0.0
   version, the Oozie process would fail following a manual upgrade from
   MapR 5.2.x/MEP3.0.1 to MapR 6.0 The upgrade process works correctly.
   FileClient 31024 When hadoop fs -rmr command is run to remove a list of
   files/directories, if a file/directory is not present at the time of
   removal, the command returns an error, 'no such file or directoryâ€™, and
   terminates without removing remaining files and/or directories from the
   given list. When hadoop fs -rmr command is run to remove a list of
   files and/or directories, if a file/directory from the list is not
   present on the system, the command now removes remaining files and/or
   directories from the list.
   30987 Memory leak in DoPathWalk This leak is fixed.
   31026 FileClient should use one source port to connect to any server
   This issue occured because FileClient was using multiple source ports
   to connect to file servers, thus exhausting all available ports. This
   issue is now fixed to let FileClient connect on a single source port.

   See Client Side Port Binding in [5]What's New in Version 6.1.0
   31129 File Client crashed at mapr::fs::CidCache::GetBinding The issue
   occured because the assumption was that the number of volume replicas
   will not exceed 7. This issue is fixed.
   31146 The SQL queries are failing intermittently The issue occured
   because user impersonation was faulty. This issue is fixed.
   31738 Create request should take setattr credentials from ticket To
   avoid this issue, all requests should take the credentials from the
   ticket, and not use the context user. This problem is fixed. See
   [6]Managing the FUSE-Based POSIX Client
   31804 FileClient hangs at WaitUntilEnqueued This is a backport of the
   fix in [7]#24266, where the Idle Flusher needed to be disabled to
   resolve hangs, for MapR version 5.2.2. This fix is backported.
   FileServer 26792 createTTVolume.sh needs to reliably determine the MFS
   state before deciding to recreate the local NM volume This bug caused
   rolling updates to fail. This issue is fixed.
   30063 FCR sent during disk I/O error causes all 3 copies of container
   to be unavailable This bug occured because the file system master
   reported incorrect replica chain managment information. This issue is
   fixed.
   30917 EIO on a read op of a local volume cid deletes/offlines the
   container but local volume in not recreated This issue was caused
   because Volume IDs were not being passed in HandleDamagedVolumes() when
   called from the ContainerOffline case, causing the volumes to be
   deleted and not recreated automatically. This bug is fixed.
   31007 FUSE clients do not honor impersonation constraints in
   servicewithimpersonation tickets This issue was caused when FUSE failed
   to honor constraints for a servicewithimpersonation ticket which
   includes impersonatedgids constraints. This issue is fixed, and FUSE
   now enforces such constraints. A support advisory is available at

   [8]https://mapr.com/support/s/article/FUSE-Clients-do-not-honor-imperso
   nation-constraints-in-servicewithimpersonation-tickets?language=en_US
   31301 Some snapcids on mirror volumes that are marked for delete never
   get deleted This issue is fixed.
   31361 Rename operation fails on tables and streams This issue occured
   when a table or stream already existed in a rename operation... that
   is, in mv x y -> y already exists. This issue is fixed.
   31365 MFS Rpc thread on CLDB node is running out of CPU This issue
   occured because the process that reads from, and writes data to the
   key-value store, was not offloaded to the compression thread. This
   issue is fixed.
   31453 MFS on CLDB slaves crashed due to failure in kvstorerangedelete
   (ENOENT) This bug occurred due to corruption of the structure that
   holds information about volume containers. This issue occurred due to a
   large number of containers being present in the volume. This issue is
   fixed. Appropriate documentation that depicts how to set the alarm for
   too many containers is available at [9]Configuring the Alarm Threshold
   Using the CLI (see CLUSTER_ALARM_TOO_MANY_SNAPSHOT_CONTAINERS), and
   [10]cldb.conf
   31981 Disk failure on Master (A) container when reporting loss of B to
   CLDB, can cause all copies to be unavailable The problem arose because
   there was no sanity check to check for the validity of a replica, when
   the reconnection timer expires. This check has been added.
   FS::ACE 26280 "hadoop mfs -setace" does not accept groups with spaces
   in the name Spaces in AD group names caused the issue. This issue is
   fixed. Spaces in AD group names are correctly parsed.
   30245 Permission denied error due to aceCache when readdir served by
   master node of NC This issue occured due to a null character in the ACE
   expression, as the ACE for execute file was null. This issue has been
   resolved.
   FS::Audit 30928 expandaudit does not resolve most of fids in a huge
   volume This issue is fixed by making logging more explanatory.
   FS::Fuse 31662 Fuse : OPEN with O_TRUNC fails with permission denied
   error This issue is fixed.
   31730 Fuse: mkdir fails with EBUSY The issue is caused by inode number
   reuse. The work around is to set the fuse.use.compressed.inode.format
   parameter to 1 as documented in [11]Configuring the MapR FUSE-Based
   POSIX Client
   32030 Fuse Assert in fs/client/fuse/cc/fuse_special_ll.c This issue was
   caused by Fuse reading debugs_assert() from the wrong location. This
   issue is now fixed.
   32050 Fuse needs to honor prod_build This issue was caused by Fuse
   reading debugs_assert() from the wrong location. This issue is now
   fixed.
   32074 Memory leak in fuse cache This leak is fixed.
   FS::Snapshot 31051 MCS & maprcli command are not showing correct Volume
   size This issue occured because some snapshot containers might have had
   a delayed deletion. This issue is fixed.
   hoststats 31858 Hoststats process is not coming up after changing the
   default value (5660) of "mfs.server.port" in /opt/mapr/conf/mfs.conf
   The problem occured because the ports were hadcorded in MapR settings.
   Using a port other than the default, causes the shared memory key to
   fail. This issue is fixed.
   MCS MON-3325

   The MapR Control System does not display topologies with hostname (in
   the topology). You cannot configure node-specific topology for a volume
   from MCS.
   Hostname displays correctly.
   MON-3248

   The MapR Control System does not support filtering list of nodes by
   services running on client nodes.
   The MapR Control System supports filtering list of nodes by services
   running on client nodes.
   SPYG-1010

   The Grafana dashboard shows "No data points" for Volume metrics
   Dashboard entries are correct.
   SPYG-916 MapR monitoring index is not loaded correctly. The MapR
   monitoring index loads correctly.
   MapR Event Store for Apache Kafka 31074 [Kafka 1.0] incorrect behavior
   for offsetsForTimes when streams.rpc.timeout.ms is configured Behavior
   corrected for offsetsForTimes when streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   Elasticsearch ES-27 Elasticsearch fails to start correctly
   Elasticsearch starts correctly.
   MapR Database 29278 Puts to tablets that failed with out of space
   errors, continue to fail on the first put, even though there is
   sufficient space; subsequent puts succeed. When space becomes
   available, the very first put no longer returns an error.
   30489 Client rpc trace messages for slow operations are not printing
   tablet fid The messages include tablet fid.
   31092 MapR file system nodes are crashing when there is a burst of read
   requests Corrected batching of read requests to avoid the condition
   that was causing the crash.
   31297 Using Python happyhbase module to scan a MapR Database table via
   HBase Thrift causes the Thrift server to hang Addressed underlying
   issue that was causing the hang.
   31766 MapR file system node crash causes client RPC timeouts during get
   and put operations Corrected the underlying logic for notification
   calls when creating new MapR Database buckets.
   31901 Memory corruption occurs when deleting/freeing memory Corrected
   race conditions that were causing the corruption.
   32262 Incremental bulkload via MapReduce fails to load data, even
   though it does not report an error Corrected the underlying logic that
   was causing the incremental load to fail without returning an error.
   NFS 31810 Unable to mount specific volume, when cldb.reject.root is
   enabled Enabling cldb.reject.root caused NFS mounts to fail. This issue
   is fixed.
   security 31935 All versions of MapR have Serious Ticket Vulnerability
   Enabling Authority Escalation This issue was caused by CLDB generating
   tickets from falsified credentials. This issue is fixed. A security
   bulletin is available at
   [12]https://mapr.com/support/s/article/MapR-Ticket-Credentials-can-beco
   me-compromised?language=en_US and the vulnerabilities list is updated
   and available at [13]Security Vulnerabilities
   Warden 31628 maprcli urls showthe wrong value for hbmaster after
   shutdown of current HBmaster This issue occured because maprcli had
   stale information on a HBase Master process that was killed. This issue
   is fixed.
   YARN 25473 Aggregated log is written with wrong ownership Addressed the
   underlying issue that was causing writing the aggregated log to the
   wrong user.
   31082 ResourceManager address does not resolve after redirect via a
   proxy request Fixed incorrect condition that updated the current
   ResourceManager address.
   31174 In the application master log, the following error repeatedly
   occurred: "Tez AM is trying to access Timeline server and it fails" TEZ
   AM is released after job or session is completed.
   31200 YARN job submission using server side uid resolution fails with
   ownership exception The problem occurred because the username was not
   read from the submitted ticket. This issue is fixed.
   31487 Containers fail in LOCALIZING state Implemented clean up of
   subprocesses spawned by Shell when the process exits. Localization
   failures are available in the container diagnostics.
   31679 CVE-2016-6811 user who can escalate to Yarn user can possibly run
   arbitrary commands as a root user Fixed the underlying security
   vulnerability.
   32178 Thread leak when executing a Scoop job Fixed thread leak.
   32304 Fails to refresh labels for nodes in the cluster
   DefaultContainerExecutor sets proper permissions.
