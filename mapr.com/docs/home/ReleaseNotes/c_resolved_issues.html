   resolved in Version 6.1.
   Component Number Description Resolution
   Upgrade 31038 Prior to 6.1, the log4j.properties file was not
   automatically updated in an upgrade. All files update automatically.
   Upgrade 29752 Priort to 6.1, if Oozie was not upgraded to the MEP4.0.0
   version, the Oozie process would fail following a manual upgrade from
   MapR 5.2.x/MEP3.0.1 to MapR 6.0. The upgrade process works correctly.
   FileClient 31024 When hadoop fs -rmr command is run to remove a list of
   files/directories, if a file/directory is not present at the time of
   remove, the command returns an error, 'no such file or directoryâ€™, and
   terminates without removing remaining files and/or directories from the
   given list. When hadoop fs -rmr command is run to remove a list of
   files and/or directories, if a file/directory from the list is not
   present on the system, the command now removes remaining files and/or
   directories from the list.
