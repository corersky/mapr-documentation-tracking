Editing core-site.xml

   With this option, you update the core-site.xml on each node with a
   service that runs a web server such as WebServer(MCS), ResourceManager,
   and HistoryServer nodes. Then, restart the services associated with the
   web servers. For example, you would need to restart the webserver
   service on the node that runs the MCS.
    1. Add the following configuration to the core-site.xml on each node
       with a service that runs a web server:
<property>
  <name>hadoop.ssl.exclude.cipher.suites</name>
  <value>
SSL_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA,SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA,SSL_RSA_
EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256
_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256
,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_DHE_DS
S_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
 </value>
</property>
          + For MapR 3.x clusters, the core-site.xml is in the following
            location: /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-0.20.2/conf/
          + For MapR 4.x and 5.x clusters, the core-site.xml is in the
            following location: /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/etc/hadoop/
    2. Restart services associated with web servers.
       For example:
          + To restart the MCS webserver: maprcli node services -webserver
            restart -nodes <webserver nodes>
          + To restart the ResourceManager service(s): maprcli node
            services -name resourcemanager -action restart -nodes <space
            delimited list of resourcemanager nodes>
