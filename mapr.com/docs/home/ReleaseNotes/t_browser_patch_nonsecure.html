Patching a Non-Secure Cluster

   The following steps show how to patch a secure cluster when you are
   unable to establish a secure connection. Once the fix is complete, no
   further action is required except to access the MCS and other web
   interfaces, such as the JobTracker UI and the ResourceManager UI.
    1. Determine which nodes in the cluster run the webserver role. For
       example:
$ maprcli node list -columns configuredservice -filter '[configuredservice==webs
erver]'
hostname  configuredservice                                    ip
centos21  webserver,nodemanager,cldb,fileserver,resourcemanager,hoststats  10.10
.82.21

    2. Perform the following steps on each webserver node:
         a. Download the script from the following location:
            [1]https://package.mapr.com/scripts/mcs/
wget https://package.mapr.com/scripts/mcs/fixssl
         b. Run the following command to update the permissions on the
            file:
chmod 755 fixssl
         c. Run the following command to run the script:
sudo ./fixssl
       Once you run the script, the following is displayed:
Webserver restarted. Issue should be resolved"

   The fixssl script performs the following steps on a node in a secure
   cluster:
    1. Updates manageSSLKeys.sh to use the new certificate cipher
       algorithm.
    2. Backs up the existing certificates so that new versions can be
       generated with the new cipher algorithm:
          + /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore is renamed to
            /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore_old
          + /opt/mapr/comf/ssl_truststore is renamed to
            /opt/mapr/comf/ssl_truststore_old
    3. Runs /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R to generate new versions of
       the keystore and truststore files.
    4. Restarts the webserver.
