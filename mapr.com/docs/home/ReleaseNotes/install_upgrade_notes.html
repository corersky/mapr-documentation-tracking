Installation and Upgrade Notes (MapR 6.1.0)

   This page describes considerations for upgrading to Map 6.1.0.

   If you are upgrading from MapR 4.x or 5.x, be sure to review the
   [1]Installation and Upgrade Notes (MapR 6.0.0) first.

Upgrading to MapR 6.1.0

   Note these considerations for upgrading to MapR 6.1.0, which apply
   regardless of the method you use to upgrade:
   Support Advisory for Upgrading to MapR 6.1.0 If you are upgrading a
   cluster with volumes created from MapR 4.0.1 or earlier, you might be
   subject to the issue described in [2]Advisory 4176. Be sure to review
   the advisory before upgrading to MapR 6.1.0.
   Upgrading to MapR 6.1.0 Might Require an OS Upgrade If you want to
   upgrade to MapR 6.1.0 but your cluster does not use a supported
   operating system, you must upgrade your operating system before
   starting the upgrade. For the list of operating system versions
   supported by MapR 6.1.0, see [3]Operating System Support Matrix (MapR
   6.x).
   Data-on-wire-encryption Beginning with MapR 6.1, data-on-wire
   encryption is enabled by default for newly created volumes on secure
   clusters. Data-on-wire encryption encrypts data in a volume during
   transmission over the wire. Data-on-wire encryption is not supported
   for non-secure clusters.

   When you upgrade a cluster to a MapR 6.1.0 secure cluster, data-on-wire
   encryption is enabled by default. You can disable data-on-wire
   encryption for individual volumes using MCS, the maprcli, or REST API
   commands.
   MapR 6.1.0 and MEP 6.0.0 MapR 6.1.0 requires MEP 6.0.0. MEP 3.0.1 or
   later can coexist with MapR 6.1.0 only temporarily in the context of an
   upgrade.
   Metrics Monitoring MapR 6.1.0 requires a minimal level of metrics
   monitoring to be configured to support metering. If metrics monitoring
   is already configured before the upgrade, you must upgrade it as part
   of the MapR Ecosystem Pack upgrade. If metrics monitoring is not
   installed, you must install it after the upgrade.

   When you upgrade to MapR 6.1 using the MapR Installer, metrics
   monitoring is configured and enabled by default. See [4]Installing
   Metering Using the MapR Installer.

   When you upgrade to MapR 6.1 using manual steps, you must install
   metrics monitoring after the upgrade. See [5]Installing Metering Using
   Manual Steps.
   Log Monitoring Upgrades If log monitoring is configured on your cluster
   and you plan to use either the MapR Installer or manual steps to
   upgrade to MapR 6.1, you might need to migrate or back up the Kibana
   and Elasticsearch indexes to version 6 before starting the upgrade. For
   more information, see [6]Pre-Upgrade Steps for MapR Monitoring.
   Migrating or backing up the indexes is not needed if log monitoring is
   not configured or if you are performing a new installation.
   Regenerating the mapruserticket File Changes to the CanImpersonate
   parameter of the mapruserticket file in MapR 6.1.0 require users who
   upgrade manually to regenerate the file before restarting Warden. See
   [7]Step 1: Restart and Check Cluster Services.

   The file needs to be regenerated to ensure that impersonation works
   correctly for non-mapr users. Prior to MapR 6.1.0, all mapruserticket
   files were generated with CanImpersonate = false. MapR 6.1.0 enforces
   the CanImpersonate parameter and sets the parameter to true for freshly
   installed clusters. For upgraded clusters, if CanImpersonate is not set
   to true, some services will not be able to impersonate.
   Upgrade Workflows The following upgrade workflows can help you
   understand the scope of activities involved in an upgrade based on the
   method you use:
     * [8]Workflow: Manual Rolling Upgrade to MapR 6.1
     * [9]Workflow: Offline Manual Upgrade to MapR 6.1
     * [10]Workflow: MapR Installer Upgrade to MapR 6.1

   OpenTSDB and Upgrades to MEP 6.0.1 or Later

   In MEPs 6.0.1 and later, the OpenTSDB service is configured to use a
   default heap size of 6 GB. In earlier MEPs, the default was 2 GB.
   Upgrading to MEPs 6.0.1 and later causes the default setting to change
   to 6 GB. If you configured a custom value for the OpenTSDB service heap
   size and you want to reinstate the custom value after upgrading to MEP
   6.0.1 or later, see [11]Configure the OpenTSDB Service Heap Size.
   Professional Support for Upgrades Upgrading can be time-consuming and
   complicated. Consider engaging MapR professional support services to
   assist in planning and executing your upgrade. For more information,
   contact your MapR support representative.

Upgrading to MapR 6.1.0 Using the MapR Installer

   Note these considerations for upgrading to MapR 6.1.0 that are specific
   to the [12]MapR Installer:
   MapR Installer 1.10.0 Before upgrading, [13]update the MapR Installer
   to version 1.10.0 or later. Only MapR Installer 1.10.0 or later can be
   used with MapR 6.1.0 and MEP 6.0.0.
   Version Upgrade Upgrading to MapR 6.1.0 from any other MapR release
   using the MapR Installer requires you to perform a [14]version upgrade.
   Changes to Auto-Provisioning Templates MapR 6.1.0 introduces changes to
   some auto-provisioning templates. See the "MapR Installer 1.10 Updates"
   described in [15]Auto-Provisioning Templates.
   Log Monitoring Upgrades If log monitoring is configured on your cluster
   and you plan to use either the MapR Installer or manual steps to
   upgrade to MapR 6.1, you might need to migrate the Kibana and
   Elasticsearch indexes to version 6 before starting the upgrade. For
   more information, see [16]Pre-Upgrade Steps for MapR Monitoring.
   Migrating the indexes is not needed if log monitoring is not configured
   or if you are performing a new installation.
   Special Consideration for MySQL Database If you are upgrading from MapR
   5.x to MapR 6.1 and your cluster is configured with a MySQL database,
   the installer prompts you for the MySQL password during the upgrade.
   You must enter the MySQL password that you specified when you first
   installed the cluster. If you did not specify a password for MySQL, you
   must leave the password field blank during the upgrade operation. If
   you specify the wrong value for the password, the upgrade can fail. See
   the known issue for IN-1972 in [17]MapR Installer Known Issues.
