Upgrade Issues

   MD-4026
          Issue: After an upgrade to MapR 6.0.1 or later, Drillbits can
          fail to start if the cluster has Drill 1.11 or Drill 1.12 and
          the Drill package is not upgraded as part of the upgrade. This
          issue can also occur during a manual rolling upgrade. The issue
          occurs because the upgrade process removes symlinks to MapR-FS
          jar files in the /opt/mapr/lib directory.
          Workaround: After upgrading MapR Core, paste the following
          script into a Linux shell, and execute the script on each of the
          upgraded nodes.

MAPR_HOME=/opt/mapr
DRILL_BASE=${MAPR_HOME}/drill
DRILL_VERSION=`cat ${DRILL_BASE}/drillversion`
DRILL_HOME=${DRILL_BASE}/drill-${DRILL_VERSION}

find ${DRILL_HOME}/jars -type l -exec rm -f {} \;
ln -sf ${MAPR_HOME}/lib/maprfs*.jar ${DRILL_HOME}/jars/3rdparty/.
ln -sf ${MAPR_HOME}/lib/maprdb*.jar ${DRILL_HOME}/jars/3rdparty/.
ln -sf ${MAPR_HOME}/lib/mapr-hbase*.jar ${DRILL_HOME}/jars/3rdparty/.
rm -f ${DRILL_HOME}/jars/3rdparty/mapr*tests.jar
rm -f ${DRILL_HOME}/jars/3rdparty/maprfs-d*
rm -f ${DRILL_HOME}/jars/3rdparty/maprdb-c*
rm -f ${DRILL_HOME}/jars/3rdparty/maprdb-s*

          After invoking the script, drillbits should start successfully.
          To confirm that there are symlinks to jar files in opt/mapr/lib,
          use this command:

 ls -ltr $DRILL_HOME/jars/3rdparty/mapr*

   31038
          Issue: During an upgrade to MapR 6.0.1 from any other MapR
          release, the following file is not updated automatically:

/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/log4j.properties

          Without the properties updates, you cannot use the scheduler
          debug logger.

          Workaround: This workaround is necessary only if you plan to use
          the scheduler debug logger. After the upgrade to MapR 6.0.1, add
          the following lines to the log4j.properties file:

yarn.debug.controller.logger = INFO, ED
yarn.debug.controller.log.file=yarn-mapr-scheduling-debug.log
yarn.debug.controller.log.maxfilesize=256MB
yarn.debug.controller.log.maxbackupindex=20

log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.
DebugController=${yarn.debug.controller.logger}
log4j.additivity.org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.
DebugController=false

log4j.appender.ED=org.apache.hadoop.yarn.WorldWritableLogAppender
log4j.appender.ED.File=${hadoop.log.dir}/${yarn.debug.controller.log.file}
log4j.appender.ED.MaxFileSize=${yarn.debug.controller.log.maxfilesize}
log4j.appender.ED.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.ED.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} : %m%n

   29752
          Issue: The Oozie process fails following a manual upgrade from
          MapR 5.2.x (MEP 3.0.1) to MapR 6.0 if Oozie is not upgraded to
          the MEP 4.0.0 version.
          Workaround: Upgrading all ecosystem components to MEP 4.0.0 is
          required before you can enable MapR 6.0 features. If you cannot
          upgrade to MEP 4.0.0 immediately, use these steps to restart
          Oozie:

         1. Stop Oozie:
maprcli node services -name oozie -action stop -nodes <nodes>
         2. Recreate the Oozie war file by using one of the following
            commands:
               o If SSL was enabled for Oozie, use this command:
/opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/bin/oozie-setup.sh -hadoop <version> /opt/mapr/h
adoop/hadoop-<version> -secure
               o If SSL was not enabled for Oozie, use this command:
/opt/mapr/oozie/oozie-<version>/bin/oozie-setup.sh -hadoop <version> /opt/mapr/h
adoop/hadoop-<version>
         3. Start Oozie:
maprcli node services -name oozie -action start -nodes <nodes>

Indexing and Mapr Drill

   28041
          Running multiple queries in sequence can cause drillbits to run
          out of direct memory. Limiting records in large batches to 5KB
          may prevent this issue from occurring. Should Drill return an
          out of memory exception, issue the following command to restart
          the drillbits:

$ maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action restart -nodes <node host names
 separated by a space>

   28096
          If you use the Google Guava library in your application and
          encounter the following error:

Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.google.common.base.Stopwatch.createS
tarted()Lcom/google/common/base/Stopwatch;

          You must use version 18.0 of the library. If you use Maven, you
          can use the following dependency:

            <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
            <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
            <version>18.0</version>
            </dependency>

Mapr-DB

   27057
          When you issue a maprcli table changelog add command, during the
          initial sync when the existing data is copied to the change log,
          the end-to-end latency during the initial 5 minutes can be high.
          After the initial sync, any latency will be small, specifically
          2-4 seconds.

MapR-ES

   31074
          MapR-ES APIs that make use of streams.rpc.timeout.ms are best
          effort APIs, the timeout is not guaranteed.

MapR Client

   23624
          The same MapR client can access both secure and nonsecure
          clusters; however, a MapR client that is configured to access a
          secure cluster can access a nonsecure cluster only if these
          conditions are met:

          + The secure cluster must be listed first in mapr-clusters.conf.
          + A user must obtain a ticket for the secure cluster even if the
            user wants to access only the nonsecure cluster.

MapR Control System

   MON-3476
          Issue:In the MapR Control System, table permissions can only be
          modified by the owner/creator of the table.
          Workaround: User, who is not the owner but has table admin
          permissions, must use the CLI to modify table permissions.

   MON-3452
          Issue: After selecting the Include System Volumes checkbox to
          display system volumes in the Volumes list pane, if you set
          quota (using the link in the Quota column), the system volumes
          are no longer displayed in the list of volumes even though the
          system volumes checkbox is still selected.
          Workaround: Deselect and then re-select the Include System
          Volumes checkbox to display the system volumes in the list of
          volumes.

   MON-3438
          Issue: You may experience some latency in the Admin > Cluster
          Settings > Alarms page when you click the name of an alarm to
          display the Alarm Settings window for the alarm.

   MON-3425
          Issue: When you filter the list of alarms in the Alarms summary
          page, the page does not refresh and display the correct list of
          alarms if there are muted alarms.

   MON-3407
          Issue: If you are upgrading from a pre-6.0 version, the MapR
          Control System might display 0 instances of webserver running in
          the Services page. This is because starting from v6.0, the UI
          static files are in mapr-webserver and the mapr-apiserver runs
          the server that sends the queries. For more information on
          webserver in v6.0, see [3]Setting Up the MapR Control System.

   MON-3404
          Issue: The topic search field in the Stream (detail) > Topic tab
          does not display correctly in Firefox.
          Workaround: Use Chrome (v58 and later) to perform a topic
          search.

   MON-3325
          Issue: The MapR Control System does not display topologies with
          hostname (in the topology). You cannot configure node-specific
          topology for a volume from MCS.
          Workaround: Use the CLI to set node-specific topology for a
          volume.

   MON-3248
          Issue: The MapR Control System does not support filtering list
          of nodes by services running on client nodes.
          Workaround: Use the [4]node list command with the filter option
          to retrieve the list of nodes, including client nodes, running a
          service.

   MON-3247
          Issue: The MapR Control System does not display NFS edge nodes
          and POSIX client nodes that are currently connected to the
          cluster when you sort the list of nodes by topology.
          Workaround: Use the [5]node list command to retrieve the list of
          client nodes currently connected to the cluster.

   MON-2409
          Issue: When you try to navigate to another cluster by clicking
          on the cluster name from the dropdown list at the top of the
          page, the Overview page for the current cluster displays and it
          takes a few minutes to display the MCS login page for the other
          cluster.

   MON-2219
          Issue: If you add Streams license separately, you may not be
          able to view the Streams page.
          Workaround: Contact MapR Support.

   MON-2218
          Issue: When you preserve snapshots, there is no notification
          (success message) or indication (Expires On column still does
          not show No Expiration) even though the operation succeeded.
          Workaround: Refresh the page after preserving a snapshot to see
          the No Expiration setting in the Expires On column.

   MON-2076
          Issue: When you select topics to remove, deselect all the topics
          in the Remove Topic confirmation window and click Cancel, then
          select a topic in the page by clicking on the checkbox, the
          Remove Topic window opens again even if you did not click on the
          Remove Topic button.
          Workaround: Refresh the page.

   MON-2018
          Issue: In the Add Change Log page, after entering field to add
          in the Publish Selected Field Path text field, the Add Field
          button is disabled.
          Workaround: Click outside the text field to enable the Add Field
          button.

   MON-2011
          Issue: When adding or editing the compression setting on a
          replica, selecting Inherited does not have any effect. The
          default value is lz4.
          Workaround: Do not select Inherited as the compression setting
          on a replica.

   MON-2009
          Issue: When modifying replica of a binary table with three or
          more column families, if you select different set of columns to
          replicate for different column families, the operation might
          result in an error.

   MON-1994
          Issue: If you adjust the system time, the time stamp associated
          with the alarm in the Active Alarms pane might show negative
          value.

   MON-1968
          Issue: In the User Disk Usage page, you cannot remove the email
          address after setting an email address for an entity by editing
          the properties.

   MON-1929
          Issue: The Save Changes button in the Access Control Expression
          builder page is disabled after entering user, group, or role
          name in text field.
          Workaround: Click outside the field to enable the Save Changes
          button.

   MON-1810
          Issue: When editing multiple volumes, you cannot undo changes to
          Auditing and Accountable Entity fields by clicking
          [revertChange.png] .

   MON-1755
          Issue: When creating a mirror volume, after entering the name of
          the source volume on the remote cluster and selecting the remote
          cluster on which the volume resides, you may see an error that
          the source volume does not exist.
          Workaround: Re-enter the name of the source volume on the remote
          cluster.

   MON-1221
          Issue: In the Alarm Settings window, if you click the cursor in
          the Additional email recipients text field and then press the
          return/enter key in the keyboard without entering an email
          address, the Cluster Settings page displays once again.

MapR Monitoring

   ES-27
          Issue: On a new installation of a secure cluster using the MapR
          Installer, Elasticsearch fails to start, and logs indicate that
          Elasticsearch key generation failed.
          Workaround: Use the Incremental Install feature of the MapR
          Installer to retry installation of the MapR Monitoring logging
          components.

   SPYG-916
          Issue: On a non-secure cluster, the MapR Monitoring index fails
          to load because Kibana tried to load the template before
          Elasticsearch started.
          Workaround: In MCS, click the Services tab, locate Kibana, and
          click the restart button to restart Kibana.

   OPTSDB-25
          Issue: Purge scripts are disabled by default because
          occasionally a purge process will not exit properly.
          Workaround: Edit the crontab file in the /etc/crontab file in
          the OpenTSDB installation directory, as follows:

crontab -e mapr

          In the file, remove the hashtag (#) at the beginning of the line
          that refers to opentsdb. You should manage and monitor the
          cronjob. Typically, the cronjob takes 30 - 45 minutes to run on
          an idle system, but on a busy system could take much longer. In
          most cases, it will not overlap with the next cronjob. Also,
          monitor the jobs to ensure that OpenTSDB is not started or
          stopped mid-job, which would cause a problem.

   SPYG-934
          Issue: On secure Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 clusters, Elasticsearch
          fails to generate a keystore password if the uuid-runtime
          package is not installed. uuid-runtime is one of the [6]MapR
          Installer prerequisites.
          Workaround: Install the uuid-runtime package from the default
          Ubuntu repository:

apt-get install uuid-runtime

   KIB-12
          Issue: Kibana versions prior to 5.6.1 have a cross-site
          scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Timelion (CVE‌-2017-11479).
          This is NOT a MapR vulnerability as MapR does not support (or
          recommend) Timelion.

MapR PACC

   See [7]MapR PACC Known Issues.

Oozie

   29634
          Issue: On a secure cluster, Oozie jobs can fail when the
          timeline server for the Hive-on-Tez user interface is configured
          with MapR-SASL.
          Workaround: Restart the resource manager and timeline server.
          For more information, see [8]Configuring the Timeline Server to
          Use the Hive-on-Tez User Interface.

   29657
          Issue: If TimelineServer and Oozie Bootstrap exist on your
          cluster, the following error message appears exactly every 10
          seconds:

Class com.sun.jersey.server.wadl.generators.WadlGeneratorJAXBGrammarGenerator$8
can not access a member of class javax.ws.rs.core.Response with modifiers "prote
cted" in at "resourcemenager.out log

          This issue is caused by Jersey 1.9 minor bug.
          Workaround: To suppress the message and keep the logs clean,
          disable logging of WadlGeneratorJAXBGrammarGenerator class in
          JRE_HOME/lib/logging.properties in the following way:

com.sun.jersey.server.wadl.generators.WadlGeneratorJAXBGrammarGenerator.level =
OFF

PJDTest Suite Compliance

   28912
          Issue: When trying to open a FIFO on a FUSE mounted filesystem,
          permissions to perform the operation are not checked.

   29234
          Issue: The FUSE-based POSIX can only trace at millisecond level
          and the test suite utimensat in pjdtestsuite fails because the
          test suite sets time in nanoseconds.

   29237
          Issue: Any user can set time using touch -t for any file on a
          FUSE mounted filesystem.

Timeline Server

   See [9]Hive-on-Tez User Interface Known Issues.
