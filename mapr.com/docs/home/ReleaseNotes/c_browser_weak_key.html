Weak Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Key

   Recently, some web browsers have updated their list of supported cipher
   algorithms which are used to ensure secure communication between the
   browser and web server. Due to this update, new browser versions may
   lose the ability to login to the MapR Control System (MCS) and other
   web interfaces since the ciphers supported by the web browser do not
   match the ciphers supported by the web servers.

Affected Versions

     * MapR - Versions 3.x, 4.x, and 5.0
     * Browsers - Latest versions such as Chrome 45 and Firefox 39

   Users might see the following error messages if they encounter the
