Operational Changes (MapR 6.0.0)

   Note the following functional changes to existing commands in Version
   6.0.

MapR-DB

   Mapr-DB JSON Client Table API

   The MapR-DB JSON Client Table API is deprecated and replaced by the
   OJAI DocumentStore API

   MapR-DB JSON Client Connection

   The client connection to the database has changed to the Connection and
   Driver OJAI APIs

   MapR-DB JSON Table Create

   The insertionorder option for MapR-DB JSON tables is not supported.
   When upgrading from MapR 5.x, all existing MapR-DB JSON tables with
   insertionorder option set to true will show a new behavior where
   insertionorder is set to false. This impacts maprcli table create,
   maprcli table info, and dbshell create.

   Library change

   There was a library change for Hive. See [1]Hive 2.1.1-1710 Release
   Notes

   Secondary Indexes and SSDs

   Solid-state drives (SSDs) are recommended when using MapR-DB JSON with
   secondary indexes. See [2]Cluster Hardware.

   Discontinuation of the Mapr-DB Elasticsearch Integration Capability

   With the release of MapR 6.0, MapR-DB Elastic Search integration
   capability has been deprecated and is no longer be available in the
   MapR-DB product. Customers using this feature in MapR 5.x environments
   will continue to be supported until the EOL of MapR 5.2 in April 2019.
   No new version updates will be made to this feature in MapR 5.x. MapR
   recommends that you use the MapR-DB Change Data Capture feature. See
   [3]Change Data Capture

MapR-FS

   Chunk Size If chunk size is zero (0), when an application makes a
   request for block size, MapR will now return 2^62
   (4611686018427387904); however, hadoop mfs commands will continue to
   display 0 for chunk size.

   core-site.xml core-site.xml is now located in in
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-<version>/etc/hadoop/ The previous location was
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop/conf

Default Database

   Configure.sh -defaultdb = HBase (hbase) is no longer supported. The
   only supported option is MapR-DB (maprdb).

Mapr-ES (Streams)

   The message offset in a partition starts from zero (0). If you are
   upgrading and do not enable the MapR-DB/ES feature,
   mfs.feature.db.streams.v6.support, the message offset in a partition
   starts from one (1).

Spyglass

   MapR-ES (Streams) is now the default mechanism through which metrics
   flow from collectd to OpenTSDB.

MapR Control System

   In prior releases, the mapr-webserver package contained both the MCS UI
   static files and the server running the Java application. Starting from
   v6.0, the UI static files are in mapr-webserver and the mapr-apiserver
   runs the server that handles the queries. The apiserver allows you to
   perform cluster administration programmatically. For more information,
   see [4]Setting Up the MapR Control System

MapR Installer

   Package dependencies have changed. Before using the installer, make
   sure that the packages described in [5]MapR Installer Prerequisites and
   Guidelines are installed. These packages are downloaded for you when
   you use the MapR Installer, but must be installed manually before you
   install without using the MapR Installer.

MapR Installer Stanzas

   MapR Installer 1.7 (which includes MapR Installer Stanzas) no longer
   supports the scaled_hosts: parameter for adding nodes to an on-premise
   cluster. Instead, you need to use the scaled_hosts2: parameter. See
   [6]Extending a Cluster by Adding Nodes.

Deprecated Features

     * MRv1
       MapReduce version 1 is no longer supported. If you were previously
       using MapReduce version 1, verify the mode your cluster is running
       in and uninstall packages related to MapReduce version 1 before
       upgrading to MapR 6.0. For more information, see [7]Migrating from
       MapReduce Version 1 to MapReduce Version 2. As part of this
       deprecation, the ExpressLane feature is no longer available
     * Ganglia
       Ganglia is no longer supported. However, you can view cluster
       metrics in MCS dashboards or custom MapR Monitoring dashboards. For
       more information, see [8]Using MapR Monitoring (Spyglass
       Initiative).
     * Mahout
     * Storm
     * Sahara
     * Hadoop Commands
       The following hadoop commands are deprecated and replaced by mapred
       command. See [9]Supported Commands for Hadoop 2.x
          + hadoop job
          + hadoop mradmin
          + hadoop pipes
          + hadoop queue
     * HBase
     * Node metrics
     * maprcli commands: job and task
          + The maprcli job changepriority, job kill, and job table
            commands are no longer supported
          + The maprcli task command including task failattempt, task
            killattempt, and task table, is no longer supported.
          + You may still see references to these commands in help text.

REST API

   As of v6.0, MapR supports HTTP requests of type POST for the following
   operations: enable, disable, create, edit, delete, move, purge, remove,
   rename, resolve, set. For example:
     * To create a volume:
curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/volume/create?<parameters>' --user
mapr:mapr
     * To edit a volume:
curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/volume/edit?<parameters>' --user ma
pr:mapr

   For all other operations, send a request of type GET. For example:
curl -k -X GET 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/volume/list?<parameters>' --user map
r:mapr

MapR Client

   For the Windows client, you do not need to configure the core-site.xml
   file with the UID, GID, and user name of the cluster user to access a
   secure cluster because the username information will be available
   through the ticket. You must configure the core-site.xml file for
   accessing non-secure cluster only. See [10]Configuring MapR Client User
   on Windows
