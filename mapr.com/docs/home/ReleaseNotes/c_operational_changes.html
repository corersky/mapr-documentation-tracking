Operational Changes (MapR 6.1.0)

   Note the following functional changes to existing commands in Version
   6.1.

MapR Database

   OJAI Support
          MapR 6.1.0 introduces support for OJAI 3.0. For a list of
          classes and methods deprecated in OJAI 3.0, see
          [1]https://mapr.com/docs/apidocs/61/ojai/java/deprecated-list.ht
          ml.

          MapR 6.1.0 deprecates support for OJAI 1.0. The next release
          after 6.1.0 will no longer support OJAI 1.0.

   Permissions on Arrays in MapR Database JSON
          Starting in MapR 6.1.0, when you grant permissions on a field
          using array syntax (for example, person[]), you no longer have
          to grant separate permissions if the field also contains
          non-array values. However, this can result in errors if you
          attempt to define a new permission that conflicts with an
          existing one.

          For example, suppose you have the following two documents in a
          JSON table:

{
    "_id" : "id001",
    "person" : [
        {"name" : {"last" : "Smith", "first" : "John"}},
        {"name" : {"last" : "Subramanium", "first" : "Ananya"}}
    ]
}
{
    "_id" : "id002",
    "person" : {"name" : {"last" : "Doe", "first" : "Jane"}}
}

          In document id001, person is an array of nested documents and in
          id002, it is a single nested document.

          The following table summarizes the behavior in 6.1 versus
          pre-6.1 when you grant permissions in the sequence shown:

   Permission Grant Sequence 6.1 Behavior Pre-6.1 Behavior Key Differences
         1. person[]
         2. person

         1. Permission granted on person in documents id001 and id002
         2. Error - conflicts with permission on person[]
            You do not need to grant this permission. The previous is
            sufficient.

         1. Permission granted on person in document id001
         2. Permission granted on person in document id002

   In 6.1, having permission on person[] also gives you permission on
   person. Prior to 6.1, you need two separate permissions.
         1. person
         2. person[]

         1. Permission granted on person in document id002
         2. Error - conflicts with permission on person
            You (or an administrator with appropriate permissions) must
            drop the permission on person before you grant permission on
            person[].

         1. Permission granted on person in document id002
         2. Permission granted on person in document id001

   In 6.1, if an array permission conflicts with an existing permission,
   you must remove the conflicting permission.

          The new 6.1 behavior applies to permissions granted in earlier
          versions after you upgrade your MapR cluster.

          Note: If you upgrade your cluster using rolling upgrades,
          whether you encounter pre-6.1 or 6.1 behavior depends on whether
          the MapR node enforcing the permission has been upgraded.

          See [2]Permissions on Arrays for more details about the new 6.1
          behavior.

   Data Types and Secondary Indexes
          In MapR Database 6.1.0, you are no longer restricted to creating
          secondary indexes on scalar data fields. You can now create
          indexes on fields with arrays and nested documents. As a
          consequence, a 6.1 index may contain additional rows that are
          missing in an equivalent pre-6.1 index. If a query uses a
          [3]covering index, MapR Database 6.1 returns these additional
          rows. See [4]Data Types and Secondary Index Fields for more
          information about data type support.

   Secondary Indexes and Upgrades
          Starting with MapR Database 6.1, you can define secondary
          indexes using container field paths. Pre-existing indexes
          created in earlier releases do not support this new
          functionality, even after you upgrade your MapR cluster to 6.1.
          After you upgrade your cluster to 6.1, any new indexes you
          create support this functionality. You can use these indexes in
          your application if you are using a 6.1 (or later) client.

          Note: If your client is running on a MapR cluster node, after
          you upgrade the cluster node, the client becomes a 6.1 client
          and supports the new indexing functionality. Your pre-6.1 client
          can use an index created in a 6.1 cluster if the index does not
          use the new container field path functionality.

          For more information about indexes on complex types, see
          [5]Complex Types Support in MapR Database JSON.

MapR Filesystem

   Data-on-Wire Encryption
          Beginning with MapR 6.1, data-on-wire encryption is enabled by
          default for newly created volumes for secure clusters.
          Data-on-wire encryption encrypts data in a volume during
          transmission over the wire. Data-on-wire encryption is not
          supported for non-secure clusters. You can disable data-on-wire
          encryption for individual volumes using MCS, the maprcli, or
          REST API commands. For more information, see the
          -wiresecurityenabled parameter of [6]volume create and [7]volume
          modify. See also [8]Creating a Volume or [9]Modifying a Volume.

   Impersonation
          Beginning with MapR 6.1:

          + You cannot generate a ticket with impersonated UID and/or GID
            as the following:
               o UID 0 and/or GID 0 (user root)
               o UID mapr_uid and/or GID mapr_gid (user mapr)
          + User mapr can impersonate anyone, including user root.

          For more information, see [10]Managing Impersonation and
          [11]maprlogin.

   MapR Tickets
          Beginning with MapR 6.1, if the UID and GID in the ticket
          (without impersonation capability) is different from the UID and
          GID of the logged-in user, all operations are performed using
          the UID and GID of the ticket and not that of the logged-in
          user.

MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka (Streams)

   Caution: Do Not Remove mapr-librdkafka In MapR 6.1 and later, the
   mapr-core package has a dependency on mapr-librdkafka. If the
   mapr-librdkafka package is installed, do not remove it manually. Doing
   so could result in the removal of MapR core packages, rendering the
   node unusable.

   Using the Incremental Install function of the MapR Installer, you can
   safely deselect the Streams Tools and Streams Clients service options.
   The MapR Installer ensures that the mapr-librdkafka package is left
   intact when the services are removed. For manual operations, removing
   the mapr-librdkafka package is not recommended unless you also plan to
   remove the MapR software.

   Partition Maximum As of MapR 6.1, the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   API enforces a maximum of 4096 partitions for a topic. If you create an
   application with the MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka 6.1 API, the
   maximum number of partitions is 4096. If you previously created an
   application with MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka 6.0.1 API (or older)
   and you've upgraded, the original number of partitions can be used. For
   example, if you were using more than 4096 partitions in MapR 6.0.1 or
   earlier, you will able to continue with the same number of partitions
   after upgrading.

MapR Installer

   Off-Cluster Elasticsearch and OpenTSDB With MapR Installer 1.10, the
   installer no longer includes an option to support off-cluster
   Elasticsearch and OpenTSDB when security is turned on. The option for
   off-cluster Elasticsearch and OpenTSDB continues to be supported for
   non-secure clusters.
