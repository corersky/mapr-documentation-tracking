What's New in Version 6.1.0

   The 6.1.0 MapR release supplies substantial new features for the
   components of the data platform.

   To see new features delivered as part of the MapR Ecosystem Pack, see
   [1]What's New in MEP 6.0.0 There are multiple new features for
   MapR-Drill. See the [2]Drill release notesfor details.

MapR 6.1.0 Is "Secure by Default"

   Because MapR 6.1.0 in its default configuration is more secure than
   MapR 6.0.1, documentation references to "built-in security" have been
   changed to "secure by default." See [3]Security for Ecosystem
   Components.

Streaming Security and Critical Data Asset Protection

   ZooKeeper Upgraded
          MapR 6.1.0 includes ZooKeeper 3.4.11 (upgraded from Zookeeper
          3.4.5 in MapR 6.0.1) to support ZooKeeper server-to-server
          authentication.

   Zookeeper Supports Server-to-Server Authentication
          As of MapR 6.1.0, ZooKeeper is automatically configured for
          server-to-server authentication with new installations of MapR
          Core. The following ZooKeeper security parameters are set to
          "true" whenever you use configure.sh to perform a new
          installation (including when configure.sh is invoked by the MapR
          Installer or MapR Installer Stanzas).

          + quorum.auth.enableSasl
          + quorum.auth.learnerRequireSasl
          + quorum.auth.serverRequireSasl

          These parameters enable secure communication between peer
          servers in the ZooKeeper quorum using SASL.

Simplified Development and Deployment of AI and Analytics Applications

   Lightweight Client Architecture
          MEP 6.0.0 introduces Node.js and Python OJAI clients that enable
          you to write MapR Database JSON applications using a language
          other than Java. These clients use the MapR Data Access Gateway
          to access your MapR cluster. The Data Access Gateway performs
          some data processing that otherwise runs in the client. This
          keeps the clients lightweight and simplifies their installation
          and use.

          See [4]Understanding the MapR Data Access Gateway for more
          details about the Data Access Gateway. See [5]What's New in MEP
          6.0.0 for more details about the new clients.

New Features in MapR Filesystem

   Storage Tiers Support for Files
          MapR Filesystem v6.1.0 includes rule-based automated tiering
          functionality for businesses looking to leverage low-cost
          storage solutions either on low-cost hardware or on the cloud to
          gain limitless storage capacity. MapR's tiering functionality
          can seamlessly integrate with the following:

          + Low-cost hardware to store data that is less frequently
            accessed, which is referred to as "warm" data
          + Cloud resources to store data that is rarely accessed or
            archived, which is referred to as "cold" data

          Enabling warm or cold tiering allows you to use valuable
          on-premise storage resources for more active or "hot" file data
          and applications. You can use "warm" or "cold" tiering for file
          data retained for compliance, historical, or other business
          reasons.

          See [6]Data Tiering for more information.

   NFSv4 Protocol Support
          As of MapR v6.1, the MapR Filesystem includes support for NFSv4
          protocol. NFSv4 provides end-to-end secure filesystem access and
          a much higher throughput compared to NFSv3, improving
          performance. MapR uses NFS Ganesha, which is an Open Source
          userspace implementation of the NFS server, for supporting NFSv4
          features. See [7]Accessing Data with NFSv4 for more information.

          Also supported are mixed-mode NFS configurations in which some
          nodes of a cluster use NFSv3 and other nodes use NFSv4. See
          [8]Installing MapR NFS.

          When installed through the MapR Installer, there is no security
          between the client and the NFS gateway whether or not the
          cluster is secure. On a secure cluster, the connection between
          NFSv4 server and MapR Filesystem is secure. The following
          options are supported for configuring Kerberos security for
          NFSv4:

          + Kerberos only (users are in the local node database)
          + LDAP and Kerberos (users are in LDAP)
          + Active Directory and Kerberos (users are in the Active
            Directory)
            For more information, see [9]Configuring NFSv4 Server for
            Kerberos.

          When configuing NFSv4 for security, make a note of the
          following:

          + If NFSv4 is installed on (existing or new) edge nodes, the
            edge nodes must be part of the Kerberos setup.
          + If NFSv4 is installed on cluster nodes, then all the cluster
            nodes must be part of the Kerberos setup.

          For more information, see [10]Accessing Data with NFSv4.

   Secure by Default
          The MapR Data Platform v6.1 and MEP v6.0 components are secure
          out-of-the-box on all new installations, ensuring all network
          connections require authentication and all data in motion is
          protected with wire-level encryption. Without requiring an
          external security manager server or a particular security
          plug-in for each ecosystem component, MapR provides the ability
          to apply security protection directly for data as it comes into
          and moves out of the platform. The security semantics are
          applied automatically on data being retrieved or stored by any
          ecosystem component, application, or users. See [11]Security for
          more information.

          Because MapR 6.1.0 in its default configuration is more secure
          than MapR 6.0.1, documentation references to "built-in security"
          have been changed to "secure by default." See [12]Security for
          Ecosystem Components.

   Encryption of Data at Rest
          MapR v6.1 includes support for encryption of data at rest. Data
          on disk (or data-at-rest) in a secure MapR cluster can be
          encrypted, enabling you to protect the data if a disk is
          compromised. Encryption of data-at-rest not only prevents
          unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data, but it also
          protects against data theft via sector-level disk access.

          See [13]Security for more information.

   Client-side Port Binding
          MapR now requires only a single source port on the client side.
          MapR will bind multiple sockets to the same port for
          establishing connections to all the nodes on the MapR cluster.

Core Data Services Innovations to Speed AI and Analytics and Lower TCO

   Complex Types Support in MapR Database JSON
          In MapR Database 6.1.0, you can write more expressive queries on
          complex types, which includes arrays of scalar types and arrays
          of nested documents. MapR Database JSON introduces the notion of
          a container field path. Using a container field path, you can
          access a field that is either a single value or an arbitrary
          array element. This is useful if you want to perform one of the
          following operations:

          + Perform comparisons on a field path that is either a single
            value or an arbitrary array element
          + Access subfields in a nested document, where the nested
            document is either an arbitrary array element or a single
            nested document
          + Access arbitrary elements in an array

          For example, suppose your JSON document contains an addresses
          field that is an array of nested documents with address details
          like street, city, and state. You can use a container field path
          to write a query that filters on any element in the addresses
          array that matches a specific city and state.

          You can also create secondary indexes using container field
          paths, improving the performance of these more expressive
          queries.

          See the following topics for more details about the feature:

          + [14]Container Field Paths
          + [15]OJAI Query Conditions Using Container Field Paths
          + [16]Using Container Field Paths as Indexed Fields

          In MapR Database 6.1.0, you also are no longer restricted to
          creating secondary indexes on scalar data fields. You can now
          create indexes on fields with arrays and nested documents. See
          [17]Data Types and Secondary Index Fields for more information.

          To understand how indexes behave, depending on the version you
          are using, see [18]Secondary Indexes and Upgrades.

   Complex Type Support in Drill
          The query planner in Drill can leverage indexes created on MapR
          Database JSON document fields with complex data types. You must
          [19]write queries using specific SQL syntax for the query
          planner in Drill to leverage indexes on complex fields.

New Features in MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka

   Idempotent (Exactly-Once) Producer
          An "exactly-once" message delivery semantic produces messages
          without duplication. Each message is delivered once and only
          once. Exactly-once is insured by uniquely identifying a group of
          messages that are atomically persisted. Exactly-once message
          delivery is set with the producer idempotence option. See
          [20]Enabling an Idempotent Producer for more information.

   Log Compaction
          Log compaction purges previous, older messages that were
          published to a topic-partition and retains the latest version of
          the record. See [21]Log Compaction for more information.

   Apache Kafka 1.1 Support
          MapR 6.1.0 introduces support for the Apache Kafka 1.1 API.

Other Enhancements

   MapR Database Enhancements

        MapR Database Table Metrics
                MapR Database 6.1.0 supports table metrics and enhanced
                node metrics. Table metrics provide more granular metrics.
                They enable you to detect and diagnose bottlenecks and
                performance issues that are specific to individual tables.

                MapR enables table metrics by default. You cannot disable
                metrics on individual tables. During installation, you can
                disable table metrics across your entire cluster by
                selecting a minimal configuration for metrics collection.

                See [22]MapR Database Metrics for more details. For
                details about table metrics, including how to disable
                them, see [23]MapR Database Table Metrics. To learn about
                how to view these metrics in the MapR Control System
                (MCS), see [24]Visualizing Table Metrics in the MapR
                Control System.

        OJAI 3.0 Support
                MapR 6.1.0 introduces support for the OJAI 3.0 API. This
                version includes extensions for new complex types support
                in MapR Database JSON. See [25]Complex Types Support in
                MapR Database JSON for an overview of this feature.

   Documentation Enhancements

        New Component Versions Matrix
                A new matrix has been added to the list of
                [26]Interoperability Matrices. The [27]Component Versions
                for Released MEPs matrix lets you compare the versions of
                ecosystem and MapR Monitoring components across different
                MEPs.

        Revised Product Naming
                Some components of the MapR Data Platform have been
                changed. MapR-Streams is now called MapR Event Store For
                Apache Kafka. MapR-DB is now MapR Database. MapR-FS is now
                MapR Filesystem.
