What's New in Version 6.0.1

   The 6.0.1 MapR release provides new functionality in addition to being
   a maintenance release. The new features of the platform are described
   briefly here. See these links for new features released separately from
   MapR 6.0.1.

   See [1]MapR Installer Updates for what is new for the MapR Installer.

   See [2]What's New in MEP 5.0.0

REST API to access MapR-DB JSON Tables using the MapR Data Access Gateway

   Starting with this release, you can use a REST API to access MapR-DB
   JSON tables. The REST API provides an alternative to writing a Java
   OJAI application, allowing you to make HTTP calls in any programming
   language. The MapR Data Access Gateway is the service that supports
   this web API.

   For more information, see:
     * [4]Using the MapR-DB JSON REST API
     * [5]Understanding the MapR Data Access Gateway
     * [6]MapR Data Access Gateway 1.0 Release Notes

Support for Event-time Timestamp for Stream Processing

   Starting with the release, MapR-ES supports an event-time timestamp.
   Because each message is automatically produced into a topic-partition
   with an event-time timestamp as part of the message record, this allows
   the Consumer to seek based on a time. See [7]Topic Messages for more
   information about event time timestamps and time-based consumption of
   topic messages.

   Additional enhancements to MapR-ES include event-time timestamps,
   time-indexing of events, event headers, and event interceptors. Event
   headers and interceptors give applications more flexibility in how they
   exchange messages. See [8]MapR-ES Java API Library for more
   information.
   For IoT applications, this ensures that data across a globally
   distributed network of devices and sensors can be properly aggregated
   for real-time analytics and applications.

Streaming Audit Logs

   You can now capture Map-XD audit logs as streams. You can build
   real-time processing applications to consume this day and therefore
   simplify monitoring audit data that is critical to your enterprise.

   See [9]Streaming Audit Logs for more information.

Limiting the size of the name container

   When you create or modify a volume, you can specify the size for the
   name container using the namecontainerdatathreshold parameter. See
   [10]volume modify for information.
