Operational Changes (MapR 6.0.1)

   Note the following functional changes to existing commands in Version
   6.0.1.

MapR Installer

   Unlike earlier MapR Installer versions, MapR Installer 1.9 requires
   some new user ID and password information for installing Grafana and
   ElasticSearch/Kibana:
     * When installing a secure cluster using the MapR Installer web-based
       interface:
          + The installer does not request a user ID or password for
            Grafana because the installer uses the cluster admin
            authentication information (requested separately) for security
            with Grafana.
          + The installer requires you to supply the Elasticsearch/Kibana
            password. Enter the password for the admin user ID.
     * When installing a nonsecure cluster using the MapR Installer
       web-based interface:
          + The installer requires you to provide the Grafana password.
            Enter the password for the admin user.
          + No Elasticsearch/Kibana user ID or password is required.

MapR-FS

   The -cid option is not supported with mrdirectorystats utility.
   Instead, use -c to specify the container ID. See [1]mrdirectorystats
   for more information.

MapR-DB

   Starting in the MapR 6.0.1 release, you do not have to enable a
   separate query service to use secondary indexes. The Operational
   Applications with MapR-DB template installs and configures the
   replication gateways needed to update secondary indexes in MapR-DB JSON
   and includes the components needed to run OJAI queries.

   However, you must enable the OJAI Distributed Query Service to use the
   following features:
     * Advanced secondary index selection
     * Sorts on large data sets
     * Parallel query execution

   For complete information, see [2]Preparing Clusters for Querying using
   Secondary Indexes on JSON Tables

MapR-ES

   As of MapR 6.0.1, along with support of Apache Kafka 1.0, the
   java.util.Collection interface is being used. This impacts applications
   using certain APIs. See the Backward Compatibility section in
   [3]MapR-ES Java API Library for detailed information.

   For MapR-ES Java applications, the behavior has changed for
   max.partition.fetch.bytes. If the first record batch in the first
   non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this configuration, the
   record batch is still returned to ensure that the consumer can make
   progress. See [4]Configuration Parameters for more information.

   For MapR-ES Java applications, the fs.mapr.rpc.timeout parameter is
   valid for MapR 6.0.0, but has been replaced with streams.rpc.timeout.ms
   in MapR 6.0.1.

   For MapR-ES Java applications, the streams.rpc.timeout.ms parameter
   replaces the following Apache Kafka parameters: request.timeout.ms,
   reconnect.backoff.ms, and retry.backoff.ms.
