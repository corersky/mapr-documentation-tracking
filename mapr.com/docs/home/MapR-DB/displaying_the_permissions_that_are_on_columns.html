Displaying Default Column Family Permissions

   Use either MCS or maprcli command to find out the users, groups, or
   roles that have permissions on the default column family.

Viewing Default Column Family Permissions in the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Column Families tab in the [1]table
   information page.
   The Default Column Family Authorization pane displays the following
   permissions for users, groups, and roles.

   Binary Table

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Append Data Can do column appends. Column appends require permission
   both at the column-family level and at the column level.
   Set Version Can set or change the maximum and minimum number of
   versions of column values to keep.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.

   JSON Table

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Traverse Data Can pass over fields in JSON documents. For example,
   suppose that a JSON table contains documents of this general structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" : "value",
               "c" : "value"
          }
}

   Suppose further that the user sjohnson has read permission on a.b, but
   not on a. For sjohnson to read a.b, the user needs the traverse
   permission on a. The user can then pass over field a to a.b. This
   permission is inherited by fields within the column family.
   Set Version Can set or change the maximum and minimum number of
   versions of column values to keep.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.

Retrieving the Default Column Family Permissions Using the CLI

   To display the permissions on a column family, run this command:
maprcli table cf colperm get -path <path> -cfname <name of column family> -json

   To display the permissions on a column, add the -name parameter:
maprcli table cf colperm get -path <path> -cfname <name of column family> -name
            <name of column> -json

   The format of the value of the -path parameter depends on whether you
   are viewing a table on a local cluster or a remote cluster.

   The json parameter displays the output as a JSON document.
