Build Your Java Application

   Follow the instructions in this section to build a Java application
   that uses OJAI and accesses MapR Database JSON tables.

1. Prepare the Directory Structure

   This application uses the JSON tables that are mapped to the file
   system and uses the POSIX permission model (read/write for users and
   groups), and more. In this tutorial we do not use any advanced security
   features. To read more about security, see [1]Performing Filesystem
   Operations on MapR Database Tables.
   A particular directory structure is needed on the VM for this
   application. Change the permissions for the apps directory, and add a
   blog folder (used by the Java REST Sample application).
ssh mapr@maprdemo
cd /mapr/demo.mapr.com/
ls -la
chmod 777 apps
mkdir apps/blog
chmod 777 apps/blog

2. MapR Database and Java: Overview

   The [2]OJAI 101 repository contains the full application that shows the
   core operations of MapR Database and OJAI.
   Before running any Java application, you have to set the library path
   to point to the MapR client library. For example:
-Dmapr.home.dir=/opt/mapr

   If you used a different name for the folder in opt, use that name.
   Code Snippets
   Create a table:
Table table = MapRDB.createTable("/apps/user_profiles");

   Create an JSON document (JSON):
Document doc = MapRDB.newDocument()
                          .set("firstName", "John")
                          .set("lastName", "Doe")
                          .set("age", 50);

   This document is very simple, but you can use the API to create any
   valid JSON document, including nested documents and arrays. The JSON
   document looks like this:
{
  "firstName" : "John",
  "lastName" : "Doe",
  "age" : 50
}

   You can now insert the document into MapR Database using the insert()
   method. You just need to set the Document ID (or rowkey):
table.insert("jdoe", doc);

   The Document ID is unique within a table. If you try to insert a
   document using an existing key, a DocumentExistsException will be
   raised. You can also use the insertOrReplace method; with this method,
   if the document with the ID exists, it will be replaced.
   You can also retrieve the document with a simple get operation:
Document doc2  = table.findById("jdoe");
System.out.println(  doc2  );
System.out.println(
       doc2.getString("firstName") +":"+ doc2.getInt("age")
);

   To update a document, you have to do the following operations:
DocumentMutation mutation = MapRDB.newMutation()
                                     .increment("age", 1)
                                     .set("interests", Arrays.asList("sports", "
movies"));
table.update("jdoe", mutation);

   As you can see, not only can you update an existing attribute, such as
   the age increment, but you can also modify the structure of the
   document. For example, we added the interests field to the document.
   We won't go into all the capabilities of the database, but let's take a
   look at a simple query. For example, return all the profiles with an
   age greater than 50:
QueryCondition condition = MapRDB.newCondition()
                                  .is("age", Condition.Op.GREATER, 50)
                                  .build();

DocumentStream rs = table.find(condition);
Iterator<Document> itrs =  rs.iterator();
while (itrs.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println( itrs.next() );
}
rs.close();

   Finally let's delete a document:
table.delete("jdoe");

   Let's also delete the table:
MapRDB.deleteTable("/apps/user_profiles");

   You have now learned the basics of OJAI and you can see how to store,
   retrieve, and delete a document from a MapR Database table.

   You can now start building your own application or look at the
   different sample applications available.

3. MapR Database and Java: Sample Application

   Clone the following git repository:
   [3]https://github.com/mapr-demos/maprdb-ojai-101

   Look at the [4]com.mapr.db.samples.basic.Ex01SimpleCRUD.run() method.

   This method calls three other methods:
     * createDocuments(), which shows different ways of creating documents
     * queryDocuments(), which shows different ways of querying documents
     * updateDocuments(), which shows different ways of updating documents

   Execute the following Maven commands:
mvn clean package
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mapr.db.samples.basic.Ex01SimpleCRUD"

   You can use the MapR Database Shell described at the end of this
   document to query JSON documents, including the one created by running
   the sample application.

4. MapR Database and Java: REST API Sample

   Clone the following git repository:
   [5]https://github.com/mapr-demos/maprdb-ojai-rest-sample

   This web application exposes a MapR Database document using a REST API
   (using JAX-RS and Swagger).
   Execute the following Maven commands:
mvn clean package
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mapr.db.samples.rest.Main"

   Look at [6]com.mapr.db.samples.rest.Main.

   Start the application and go to: http://localhost:8080
