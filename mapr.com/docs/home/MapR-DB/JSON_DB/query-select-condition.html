Querying with Select and Conditions

   The examples in this section query a document store and return specific
   fields from documents that have specific conditions.

   For more information about how to specify query conditions in OJAI, see
   [1]Query Conditions in OJAI Applications.
   Note: You can improve the performance of queries with conditions by
   using secondary indexes. See [2]Queries that Benefit from Secondary
   Indexes for more details.
     * [3]Java
     * [4]dbshell

   The following example shows how to return the name, address.zipCode,
   age, and phoneNumber fields from documents that have address.zipCode
   equal to 95196. It uses the [5]Query.select and [6]Query.where methods,
   specifying the query condition as a JSON string.

   The following two dbshell commands are equivalent to the code example.
   See [7]dbshell find or findbyid for more details about the syntax
   dbshell provides.
find /demo_table --query {
   "$select":["name","address.zipCode","age","phoneNumber[0]"],
   "$where":{"$eq":{"address.zipCode":95196}}
}

find /demo_table
   --fields name,address.zipCode,age,phoneNumber[0]
   --where {"$eq":{"address.zipCode":95196}}

   Note: The commands are shown split across multiple lines for
   readability. When using dbshell, you must enter them in a single line.
