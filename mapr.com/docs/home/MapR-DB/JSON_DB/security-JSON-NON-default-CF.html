Permissions on Non-default Column Families

   If a JSON document field is not in the MapR-DB JSON default column
   family, you must have readperm and writeperm permissions to perform
   read and write operations on the field. You either receive the
   permissions from the column family, inherit them from the field's
   parent field, or have the permissions from an explicit grant on the
   field.
   Note: Non-default column families are an advanced feature of MapR-DB's
   native JSON support. For information about them, see [1]Managing Column
   Families.

   The following diagram shows a JSON document where fields b and c are in
   a column family cf1 that is defined at field b with the path a.b.

Granting Read and Write Permissions on Field c

   To perform both read and write operations on field c, when it is in
   column family cf1, you must have both readperm and writeperm access on
   field c:
     * If you have readperm and writeperm permissions on cf1, then you
       have access to field c.
     * If you have readperm and writeperm permissions on field b, then you
       have access to field c. You do not need any further permissions.
       Field c inherits your readperm and writeperm permissions from field
       b.
     * If you have readperm and writeperm permissions on cf1 but either
       field a or b denied you permissions:
          + You must have traverseperm permission granted to you on the
            field that denied you access (field a or b).
          + You must have readperm and writeperm permissions explicitly
            granted to you on field c.
     * If you do not have readperm and writeperm permissions on cf1:
          + You must have traverseperm permission granted to you on either
            cf1 or field b.
          + You must have readperm and writeperm permissions explicitly
            granted to you on field c.

   The following are examples of commands that grant these permissions:
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table >
  -cfname cf1
  -name a.b
  -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table >
  -cfname cf1
  -name a.b.c
  -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
  -writeperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf edit
  -path <path to JSON table >
  -cfname cf1
  -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table >
  -cfname cf1
  -name a.b.c
  -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
  -writeperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

Granting Read or Write Permission on Field c

   To perform either read or write operations on field c, when it is in
   column family cf1, you must have either readperm or writeperm access on
   field c:
     * If you have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on cf1,
       then you have access to field c.
     * If you have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on field b,
       then you have access to field c. You do not need any further
       permissions. Field c inherits your readperm or writeperm permission
       from field b.
     * If you have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on cf1 but
       either field a or b denied you permission:
          + You must have traverseperm permission granted to you on the
            field that denied you access (field a or b).
          + You must have readperm or writeperm permission explicitly
            granted to you on field c.
     * If you do not have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on
       cf1:
          + You must have the traverseperm permission granted to you on
            either cf1 or field b.
          + You must have readperm or writeperm permission explicitly
            granted to you on field c.

   The following example grants traverseperm permission:
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table>
  -cfname cf1
  -name a.b
  -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

   The following example grants readperm permission:
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table>
  -cfname cf1
  -name a.b.c
  -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
