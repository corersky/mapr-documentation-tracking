Using the Python OJAI Client

   Starting with MEP 6.0, you can use the Python OJAI client to write MapR
   Database JSON applications. The client provides you with a lightweight
   library that supports the OJAI API. You can connect to MapR Database
   JSON, and add, update, and query documents in a MapR Database JSON
   table.

   The client provides you with the following benefits:
     * Easy installation and use
     * Access to MapR Database JSON through the OJAI interface in Python
     * An OJAI interface that is tailored to Python developers
     * Use of Python types to manipulate MapR Database JSON documents
     * Support for Python multiprocessing and multithreading modules
     * Support for L3/L4 (transport level) and L7 (application level)
       proxy load balancing

   To use the Python OJAI client, you must install the [1]MapR Data Access
   Gateway on your MapR cluster. The gateway serves as a proxy for
   translating requests between the Python client and the MapR cluster.
   The gateway also performs data processing to keep the client
   lightweight. See [2]Administering the MapR Data Access Gateway for
   information about how to administer the gateway and configure load
   balancing.
