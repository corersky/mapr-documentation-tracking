MapR-DB JSON Tables

   JSON documents are stored in MapR-DB JSON tables. MapR-DB supports
   schema flexibility in the documents and provides the tools to
   efficiently access them. It optimizes the storage of the JSON
   documents, providing high performance.

   When a JSON document is added to a JSON table, it is put in a table
   row. The table row is part of one column family (although you can
   create more, as described in [1]Column Families in JSON Tables). The
   value in the row is a single JSON document that is stored in a binary
   format. The binary format allows MapR-DB to make a number of
   optimizations to the documentâ€™s layout to make data access fast and
   efficient. MapR-DB also maintains the data types associated with fields
   in a JSON document.

   The JSON documents in a table need not have identical structures. It is
   possible to include in a table any number of JSON documents that have
   no common fields or share only a subset of fields.

   For example, an online retailer might have the following three
   documents in a single JSON table. Only a subset of fields is common to
   all three documents. These are key differences:
     * Each document has a different nested document in a field named
       specifications.
     * Only two of the documents have arrays in the field features.
     * The retailers field has different types in the first and third
       documents.

     * [2]Document 1
     * [3]Document 2
     * [4]Document 3

Table Paths

   Tables are stored in the MapR file system. When providing the path to a
   table in MapR tools and APIs, use these conventions:
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer in
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

Tools for Creating and Administering JSON Tables

   These are the tools available for creating and administering JSON
   tables in MapR-DB:

   MapR-DB Shell
          This shell is a light-weight tool for manipulating JSON tables
          and documents. Learn more about it at [5]MapR-DB Shell (JSON
          Tables).

   MapR-DB JSON Client API
          This API allows you to manage MapR-DB JSON tables. The API
          includes methods to create, alter, and drop tables and column
          families. Learn more about these APIs at [6]Managing JSON
          Tables.

   MapR-DB JSON REST API
          The REST API allows you to create and drop MapR-DB JSON tables
          using HTTP calls. Learn more about it at [7]Using the MapR-DB
          JSON REST API.

   MapR-DB JSON utilities
          MapR-DB JSON supports several utilities for loading tables.
          Learn more about these utilities at [8]Loading Documents into
          JSON Tables.

   maprcli commands
          The maprcli table commands fully support JSON tables. See
          [9]table.

   Note: For a list of tools available to query and manage documents in
   MapR-DB JSON tables, see [10]Tools for Working with JSON Documents.
