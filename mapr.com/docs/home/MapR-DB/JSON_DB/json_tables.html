MapR Database JSON Tables

   JSON documents are stored in MapR Database JSON tables. MapR Database
   supports schema flexibility in the documents and provides the tools to
   efficiently access them. It optimizes the storage of the JSON
   documents, providing high performance.

   When a JSON document is added to a JSON table, it is put in a table
   row. The table row is part of one column family (although you can
   create more, as described in [1]Column Families in JSON Tables). The
   value in the row is a single JSON document that is stored in a binary
   format. The binary format allows MapR Database to make a number of
   optimizations to the documentâ€™s layout to make data access fast and
   efficient. MapR Database also maintains the data types associated with
   fields in a JSON document.

   The JSON documents in a table need not have identical structures. It is
   possible to include in a table any number of JSON documents that have
   no common fields or share only a subset of fields.

   For example, an online retailer might have the following three
   documents in a single JSON table. Only a subset of fields is common to
   all three documents. These are key differences:
     * Each document has a different nested document in a field named
       specifications.
     * Only two of the documents have arrays in the field features.
     * The retailers field has different types in the first and third
       documents.

     * [2]Document 1
     * [3]Document 2
     * [4]Document 3

Container Syntax

   Starting in MapR Database 6.1, even though the retailers field is an
   array of nested documents in document 1 and a nested document in
   document 3, you can reference subfields of the nested documents in both
   documents using the following container syntax:
retailers[].name

   Specifying that field reference returns the following for the three
   documents:
{
    "retailers":{"name":"Eden Bicycles"}
}
{}
{
    "retailers":[
        {"name":"Bespoke Cycles"},
        {"name":"Trek Bicycle"}]
}

   Note: An empty document is returned for the second document because
   that document does not have a retailers field.

   See [5]Container Field Paths for more information.

Table Paths

   Tables are stored in the MapR file system. When providing the path to a
   table in MapR tools and APIs, use these conventions:
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer in
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following path:
       /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

Tools for Creating and Administering JSON Tables

   These are the tools available for creating and administering JSON
   tables in MapR Database:

   MapR Database Shell
          This shell is a light-weight tool for manipulating JSON tables
          and documents. Learn more about it at [6]MapR Database Shell
          (JSON Tables).

   MapR Database JSON Client API
          This API allows you to manage MapR Database JSON tables. The API
          includes methods to create, alter, and drop tables and column
          families. Learn more about these APIs at [7]Managing JSON
          Tables.

   Python OJAI Client
          This API allows you to create and drop MapR Database JSON tables
          in Python. Learn more about it at [8]Using the Python OJAI
          Client.

   MapR Database JSON REST API
          The REST API allows you to create and drop MapR Database JSON
          tables using HTTP calls. Learn more about it at [9]Using the
          MapR Database JSON REST API.

   MapR Database JSON utilities
          MapR Database JSON supports several utilities for loading
          tables. Learn more about these utilities at [10]Loading
          Documents into JSON Tables.

   maprcli commands
          The maprcli table commands fully support JSON tables. See
          [11]table.

   Note: For a list of tools available to query and manage documents in
   MapR Database JSON tables, see [12]Tools for Working with JSON
   Documents.
