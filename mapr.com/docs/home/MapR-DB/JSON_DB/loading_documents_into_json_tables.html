Loading Documents into JSON Tables

   There are three command-line utilities for loading documents into JSON
   tables: mapr copytable, mapr importtable (which works in conjunction
   with the mapr exporttable utility), and mapr importJSON

   You can choose whether to have these utilities perform bulk loads or
   incremental loads.

   For bulk loads, the -bulkload parameter of the JSON table must be set
   to true. During a bulk load, client applications are unable to access
   the table. After the utility is finished, you must set the table's
   -bulkload parameter to false, so that client applications can access
   the table again.

   When you set the -bulkload parameter to true, you cannot enable
   replication on the table. Since this effectively disables logging on
   the table, MapR Database also does not capture log data that
   Elasticsearch can use to index the table.
   Note: Incremental loads allow client applications to access the table
   as the documents are loaded. However, incremental loads are slower than
   bulk loads.

mapr copytable

   The mapr copytable utility copies documents -- all documents or a
   subset determined by a range of row keys, and all fields or a subset of
   fields -- directly from oneJSON table to another.

   subset of data from one table to another

   For reference information about this utility, see [1]mapr copytable.

mapr exporttable and mapr importtable

   The mapr exporttable utility exports data from a JSON table to binary
   sequence files that you can import into another JSON table by using the
   mapr importtable utility.

   files and then imported into another JSON table JSON documents exported

   another JSON table

   The destination directory is created by the mapr exporttable utility.
   To prevent accidental overwriting of data, the mapr exporttable utility
   fails if the destination directory already exists.

   The command for running the mapr importtable utility in step 2 of the
   diagram above would look like this:
mapr importtable -src /data/* -dst /collection/artworks

   The -columns parameter of the mapr exporttable utility lets you export
   subsets of the fields in the documents that are in a table. For
   example, to export field b, the fields under it, and field d from
   documents with the following structure, the command to run the mapr
   exporttable utility would look like this:
mapr exporttable -columns a.b,c.d -src /collection/all_data -dst /data

   JSON ExportTable and ImportTable.

mapr importJSON

   This utility imports one or more JSON documents that are text files
   into a JSON table.

   JSON table JSON documents in a folder named /data being imported into a
   JSON table

   If the each document does not already contain an _id field to use as a
   document ID, the mapr importJSON utility adds an _id field during the
   import. Use the -idfield parameter to specify the name of the field
   that contains the value to copy into the value of the _id field.

   For example, each document might have a product_ID field that contains
   a universally unique identifier. You could run the utility with this
   command:
mapr importJSON -idfield "product_ID" -src /data/* -dst /collection/artworks

   For reference information about this command, see [3]mapr importJSON.
