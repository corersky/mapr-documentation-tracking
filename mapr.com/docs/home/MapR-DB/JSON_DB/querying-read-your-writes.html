Reading Your Own Writes in Java OJAI

   The Java OJAI DocumentStore and Query APIs provide the ability to track
   writes to JSON tables. Use these APIs to ensure your application reads
   recent writes on JSON tables with secondary indexes.

Description

   You should use this feature if it is important for your query results
   to reflect synchronized data between a JSON table and its secondary
   indexes. Because MapR-DB updates secondary indexes asynchronously, it
   is possible for a JSON table and its secondary indexes to become
   out-of-sync while the index update is in progress.

   For example, consider the following scenario:
     * Your application updates a JSON table.
     * The JSON table includes an address field that is a nested document
       with a zipCode subfield.
     * You have a secondary index on zipCode.
     * Later in your application, you query the JSON table filtering on
       zipCode.

   You want your query result to reflect the updates from earlier in your
   application. To achieve this, use the DocumentStore and Query APIs that
   enable you to retrieve up-to-date information from the index. The APIs
   synchronize write operations on the JSON table with read operations on
   a secondary index.

   See [1]Asynchronous Secondary Index Updates for more information about
   index updates.

API Details

   The OJAI DocumentStore and Query interfaces provide the following
   methods to support this functionality.

   DocumentStore.beginTrackingWrites
          Begins tracking the write operations performed through this
          instance of DocumentStore. The method takes an optional
          previousWritesContext parameter. If you specify this parameter,
          the tracking uses that context as the base state.

   DocumentStore.endTrackingWrites
          Flushes any buffered writes operations for this DocumentStore
          and returns a writesContext. Use this context to ensure that
          writes are visible to later queries. You can use the context
          across DocumentStore objects in the same, as well as different,
          client processes, when the stores refer to the same JSON table.
          For example, you can pass the writesContext returned by one
          DocumentStore to a second DocumentStore, to begin write tracking
          on the second store.

   DocumentStore.clearTrackedWrites
          Stops the write tracking and clears any state on this
          DocumentStore instance.

   Query.waitForTrackedWrites
          Sets the writesContext parameter for this query. A writesContext
          allows this query to "see" all the writes that happened inside
          the writesContext of a DocumentStore.

Read Your Own Writes Example

   A complete code example is available on github at
   [3]OJAI_013_ReadYourOwnWrite.java. The following are code snippets from
   that example. Each step contains links to corresponding lines of code
   in the github example:
    1. Call [4]beginTrackingWrites to set the starting point for the
       commit context on the JSON table /demo_table:
// Create an OJAI connection to MapR cluster
final Connection connectionNode1 = DriverManager.getConnection("ojai:mapr:");

// Get an instance of OJAI DocumentStore
final DocumentStore storeNode1 = connectionNode1.getStore("/demo_table");

// initiate tracking of commit-context
storeNode1.beginTrackingWrites();
    2. [5]Update the zipCode of an existing user and [6]insert a new user
       in /demo_table:
// issue a set of mutations/insert/delete/etc
storeNode1.update("user0000", connectionNode1.newMutation().set("address.zipCode
", 95110L));
storeNode1.insertOrReplace(connectionNode1.newDocument(
    "{\"_id\": \"user0004\", \"firstName\": \"Joel\", \"lastName\": \"Smith\", \
"age\": 56, \"address\": {\"zipCode\":{\"$numberLong\":95110}}}"));
    3. Call [7]endTrackingWrites to flush the write operations after step
       1, including updates to the secondary index:
final String commitContext = storeNode1.endTrackingWrites();
       The call also returns a commitContext.
    4. Issue a query that calls [8]waitForTrackedWrites with the
       commitContext from step 3:
/*
 * Next section of the code can run on the same or on a different node,
 * the `commitContext` obtained earlier needs to be propagated to that node.
 */

// Create an OJAI connection to MapR cluster
final Connection connectionNode2 = DriverManager.getConnection("ojai:mapr:");

// Get an instance of OJAI DocumentStore
final DocumentStore storeNode2 = connectionNode2.getStore("/demo_table");

// Build an OJAI query and set its commit context with timeout of 2 seconds
final Query query = connectionNode2.newQuery()
    .select("_id", "firstName", "lastName", "address.zipCode")
    .where("{\"$gt\": {\"address.zipCode\": 95110}}")
    .waitForTrackedWrites(commitContext)
    .build();
       The query filters on the indexed subfield address.zipCode. The
       commitContext ensures that the query result includes the changes
       made in step 2.
