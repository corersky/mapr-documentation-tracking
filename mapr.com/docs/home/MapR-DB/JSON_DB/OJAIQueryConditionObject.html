Creating an OJAI QueryCondition Object

   The Java OJAI client supports a QueryCondition interface. After you
   create a QueryCondition object, call methods in the class to construct
   your query condition.

Creating a QueryCondition Object

     * [1]Java

   Java OJAI provides a QueryCondition.is() method for specifying query
   conditions. The method takes three arguments:
     * The field path to apply the condition to
     * The condition operator, represented as a QueryCondition.Op
     * The value to compare the field path against

   The field path is either a field in a JSON document, a subfield within
   a nested document, or an array element.

   Depending on the type of the field path, you specify the comparison
   value as follows:

   Scalar Data
          You can specify the value using either a Java typed value (for
          example, int, float, or String) or a Java OJAI object. The API
          supports the following OJAI types:

          + ODate
          + OInterval
          + OTime
          + OTimestamp

   Nested Documents
          You can specify only equality and non-equality conditions on
          nested documents. You specify the nested document using a Java
          Map object. In the case of equality, all of the fields in the
          nested document must match. The order of the fields is not
          relevant.

   Arrays
          You can specify only equality and non-equality conditions on
          arrays. You specify an array using a Java List object. In the
          case of equality, the order of the elements and the element
          values must match.

   In addition to QueryCondition.is(), QueryCondition also supports the
   following methods:
   QueryCondition Method Description
   equals()

   notequals()
   Match for equality or non-equality on nested documents and arrays
   in() Search for individual elements in an array
   like() Search for string values using SQL LIKE expressions

   matches()

   Search for string values using regular expressions.

   You can use regular expressions that compose the Perl-Compatible
   Regular Expressions (PCRE) library as well as a subset of the regular
   expressions that are supported in java.util.regex.pattern. See [2]HBase
   Java Regular Expressions Support for a list of supported regular
   expressions.
   and() Begins a new AND condition block
   or() Begins a new OR condition block
   close() Closes a compound condition block
   build() Builds the condition
   Note: The material described in this section is a subset of the
   QueryCondition API. It introduces you to the basics of the API. For the
   complete API, see the [3]QueryCondition interface.

Example: Creating a QueryCondition Object

   The following example shows how to define a QueryCondition object for
   this query condition:
(a.b.[0].boolean == false && (a.c.d != 5 || a.b[1].decimal > 1 || a.b[1].decimal
 < 10))
     * [4]Java

QueryCondition qc = connection.newCondition()
    .and()
        .is("a.b[0].boolean", Op.EQUAL, false)
        .or()
            .is("a.c.d", Op.NOT_EQUAL, 5)
            .is("a.b[1].decimal", Op.GREATER, 1)
            .is("a.b[1].decimal", Op.LESS, 10)
            .close()
    .close()
    .build();

   Pass the QueryCondition object to the [5]Query.where method. See the
   Java - OJAI QueryCondition Object example at [6]Querying with
   Conditions for a complete Java code example.
