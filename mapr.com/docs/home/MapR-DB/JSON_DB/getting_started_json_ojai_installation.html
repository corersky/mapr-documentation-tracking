Installation

   Follow these steps to install and configure MapR-DB.

Install MapR-DB

   The MapR Sandbox is available as a virtual machine (VM) so the
   installation is straightforward.

   The VM is configured to use a host-only network. Check that you have a
   host-only network configured in your environment.
   Add the IP address of the VM to your /etc/hosts file. On Windows:
Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

   In the /etc/hosts file, use the MapR-DB machine name maprdemo.
   The VM is a CentOS Linux. You can connect to it using SSH:
# password is mapr
ssh mapr@maprdemo

Set MAPR_HOME on Your Host

   On your host Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux machine where you will write
   and run your Java applications, follow these steps:
    1. Create the following directory structure:
/opt/mapr/conf  (for Linux and OSX)
C:\opt\mapr\conf (for Windows)
    2. If you have a MapR client installed on your machine (existing
       /opt/mapr folder), use it; otherwise, create a new folder. Use an
       arbitrary name for the folder. For example:/opt/mapr_51
    3. Create a file in this folder named mapr-clusters.conf.
    4. Add the following line to this file:
demo.mapr.com maprdemo:7222
       Note: maprdemo is the host name or IP address of the VM where the
       MapR Sandbox is running.
