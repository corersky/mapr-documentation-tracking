Permissions and OJAI Queries

   You need to understand permission requirements because they affect
   filter conditions in your OJAI queries.

   MapR Database enforces permissions when your application processes the
   query result. In the basic application flow shown in the previous
   section, this corresponds to step 5. In an application, if user1
   performs the query while user2 processes the result, then the result
   corresponds to user2's permissions.

   You should create a separate OJAI connection for each unique user.
   Sharing a connection across users can result in non-optimal queries or
   invalid permission errors.

   The following permissions are required to query documents:
     * The readAce permission on the volumes where the JSON tables that
       contain the documents are located. See [1]Setting Whole Volume
       ACEs.
     * The readperm permission on the JSON table's column families
       containing fields being queried. See [2]Enabling Table and Stream
       Authorizations with ACEs.

   If the user does not have the readperm permission on a field, MapR
   Database treats the field as non-existent for that user. When a query
   selects a non-existent field, MapR Database ignores the field. If a
   query filters on a non-existent field, the query behaves as follows:

   CAPTION:

   Filter Condition on Non-existent Field Behavior
   Filter for specific values in the field No documents qualify the filter
   because a non-existent field does not match any value.
   Filter for non-matches in the field All documents qualify the filter
   because a non-match on a non-existent field is a no-op.

   The exception is the rowkey field. Access control on the rowkey is not
   available. Users can always select and filter on rowkey.

   For information about setting permissions, see [3]Permission Types for
   Fields and Column Families in JSON Tables.
