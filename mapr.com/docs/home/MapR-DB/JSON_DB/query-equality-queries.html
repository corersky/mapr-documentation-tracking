Using Indexes to Optimize Equality Conditions

   Using indexes can help you improve the performance of queries that have
   equality conditions. You can define indexes that optimize equality
   conditions on scalar data fields, nested document and array fields, and
   container field paths.

   If the index has a single key, the condition limits the index search to
   only the keys matching the scalar value. If the index has more than one
   key and there are equality conditions on all keys, the conditions limit
   the search to the combined matching values. If there are conditions on
   a subset of fields and the most significant keys have equality
   conditions, MapR Database limits the search to those scalar values.

   Assume that you have a MapR Database JSON table with documents in the
   following format:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
        {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
        {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
        {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

   The examples in the following sections reference this sample JSON
   document.

Indexes on Scalar Data Fields in Equality Conditions

   The following table provides examples where MapR Database can and
   cannot use the index with equality conditions on scalar data. The last
   entry in the table illustrates the case where you can use index to
   optimize an equality condition in combination with a range condition.
   Note: This example assumes that a [1]composite index exists on fields
   Address.State and Address.City.
   Query Condition How MapR Database Uses the Index
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$eq":{"Address.City":"Oakland"}}
  ]
}

   Performs a lookup on the specified state and city values, and reads the
   index until the conditions no longer match.
{"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Performs a prefix lookup to find matching state values. The value of
   the Address.City field is not relevant. Continues reading from the
   index until the state field no longer matches "CA".
{
  "$and":[
    {"$in":{"Address.State":["CA","NY","MA"]}},
    {"$eq":{"Address.City":"Springfield"}}
  ]
}

   Performs the following three lookups in the index:
     * Address.State = "CA" and Address.City = "Springfield"
     * Address.State = "NY" and Address.City = "Springfield"
     * Address.State = "MA" and Address.City = "Springfield"

{"$eq":{"Address.City":"Oakland"}}

   Even if the query references the field Address.State, MapR Database
   cannot use the index unless there is also an equality condition on the
   leading key of the index, Address.State.
{"$in":{"Address.State":["CA","NY","MA"]}}

   Performs three prefix lookups, one for each of the values in the IN
   clause.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$ge":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State = "CA" and
   Address.City = "Oak". Continues reading the index until the condition
   Address.State = "CA" no longer qualifies.

Indexes on Nested Document Fields in Equality Conditions

   Starting in MapR 6.1, you can define an index on fields that contain
   nested documents. These indexes benefit only equality conditions. The
   query condition must specify all subfields from the nested document.
   They must match the subfields of nested documents stored in your MapR
   Database JSON table. The order of the subfields is not relevant.

   For example, if you define an index on the Addresses field, and specify
   the following query condition:
{
  "$eq":{
    "Addresses":{
      "Street":"123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City":"Oakland",
      "State":"CA",
      "Zipcode":"94601-1001"
    }
  }
}

   MapR Database can use the index to locate the sample document shown
   earlier.

   On the other hand, if you specify the following condition instead:
{
  "$eq":{
    "Addresses":{
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA"
    }
  }
}

   When MapR Database reads using the index and applies this query
   condition, it does not match the sample document. The condition is
   missing the Street and Zipcode subfields. If you want to match on only
   the City and State subfields, you can define a composite index on those
   subfields as described in the previous section.

Indexes on Array Fields in Equality Conditions

   Starting in MapR 6.1, you can define an index on fields that contain
   array data. These indexes benefit only equality conditions. The array
   elements and their order specified in your query condition must match
   the content and order stored in your MapR Database JSON table.

   For example, if you define an index on the Hobbies field, and specify
   the following query condition:
{"$eq":{"Hobbies":["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"]}}

   MapR Database can use the index to locate the sample document shown
   earlier.

   On the other hand, if you specify the following condition instead:
{"$eq":{"Hobbies":["Cooking", "Baseball", "Reading"]}}

   When MapR Database reads using the index and applies this query
   condition, it does not match the sample document. Although the
   individual array elements match, the order does not.

   If Hobbies also has scalar data, MapR Database can use the index to
   locate documents with the following condition:
{"$eq":{"Hobbies":"Baseball"}}

   If your MapR Database JSON table has a document where the Hobbies field
   has a single value "Baseball", MapR Database can use the index to
   locate the matching document.

Indexes on Container Field Paths in Equality Conditions

   Starting in MapR 6.1, you can define an index using a container field
   path as the indexed field.

   For example, suppose you want to search for individual hobbies within
   the Hobbies array field, rather than matching the entire array field.
   You can define an index on the following field:
Hobbies[]

   The following examples show equality conditions that benefit from this
   index:
                            Query Condition                          Description
   {"$eq":{"Hobbies[]":"Baseball"}}

   Finds documents that contain Baseball as a hobby
   {"$in":{"Hobbies[]":["Baseball","Cooking"]}}

   Finds documents that contain either Baseball or Cooking as a hobby
{
    "$and":[
        {"$eq":{"Hobbies[]":"Baseball"}},
        {"$eq":{"Hobbies[]":"Cooking"}}
    ]
}

   Finds documents that contain both Baseball and Cooking as hobbies

   When using the Hobbies[] container field path in the query condition,
   the condition matches both array elements and individual scalar values.

   For another example, suppose you want to filter on phone types. You can
   define an index on the following field:
Phones[].Type

   The following examples show equality conditions that benefit from this
   index:
                            Query Condition                         Description
   {"$eq":{"Phones[].Type":"Mobile"}}

   Finds documents that have a mobile phone number
   {"$in":{"Phones[].Type":["Mobile","Work"]}}

   Finds documents that contain either a mobile or work phone number
{
    "$and":[
        {"$eq":{"Phones[].Type":"Mobile"}},
        {"$eq":{"Phones[].Type":"Work"}}
    ]
}

   Finds documents that contain both mobile and work phone numbers

   When using the Phones[].Type container field path in the query
   condition, the condition matches instances where Phones is an array of
   nested documents as well as a single nested document.
   Important: To use an index defined on a container field path, the
   container field paths in the query condition and indexed fields must
   match.

   The following table shows examples of conditions that do not benefit
   from the index shown:
   Indexed Field Query Conditions that do not Benefit
   Hobbies
{"$eq":{"Hobbies[]":"Baseball"}}

   This condition requires an index defined on Hobbies[].
   Hobbies[]
{"$eq":{"Hobbies":["Baseball", "Cooking"]}}

   This condition requires an index defined on Hobbies.
   Phones[].Type
{"$eq":{"Phones[0].Type":"Mobile"}}

   This condition cannot be used with indexes because you cannot define an
   index on array elements.
   temps[][]
{"$ge":{"temps[][1]":60}}

   This condition cannot be used with indexes because you cannot define an
   index on array elements..
{"$eq":{"temps[]":[78,54]}}

   This condition requires an index defined on temps[].
   temps[]
{"$ge":{"temps[][]":60}}

   This condition requires an index defined on temps[][].
