Using the Go OJAI Client

   Starting with MEP 6.0.0, you can use the Go OJAI client to write MapR
   Database JSON applications. The client provides you with a lightweight
   library that supports the OJAI API. You can connect to MapR Database
   JSON, and add, update, and query documents in a MapR Database JSON
   table.

   The client provides you with the following benefits:
     * Easy installation and use
     * Access to MapR Database JSON through the OJAI interface in Go
     * An OJAI interface that is tailored to Go developers
     * Use of Go types to manipulate MapR Database JSON documents
     * Support for Go multithreading using Goroutines
     * Support for L3/L4 (transport level) and L7 (application level)
       proxy load balancing

   To use the Go OJAI client, you must install the [1]MapR Data Access
   Gateway on your MapR cluster. The gateway serves as a proxy for
   translating requests between the Go client and the MapR cluster. The
   gateway also performs data processing to keep the client lightweight.
   See [2]Administering the MapR Data Access Gateway for information about
   how to administer the gateway and configure load balancing.
