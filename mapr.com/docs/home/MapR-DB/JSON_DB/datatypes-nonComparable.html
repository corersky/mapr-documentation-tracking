Using Noncomparable JSON Document Data Types in Comparisons and Sorts

   Noncomparable data types are data types that do not follow a
   well-defined order. In contrast to comparisons between [1]comparable
   types, comparisons between fields and values of noncomparable types do
   not qualify even if you perceive a match in values. This is true
   whether you have indexed the field you are comparing or not.

   Arrays and nested documents also fall into the noncomparable category.
   Because they do not have a defined ordering, only equality comparisons
   on these types are meaningful. For arrays, the order of the array
   elements must match; for nested documents, all fields in the nested
   document must match, but the order of the fields is not relevant.

   You cannot order on [2]Container Field Paths. For example, you cannot
   order on the field a[].b, even if the subfield b has scalar data.

Example

   Consider the following example. If your field, docField, has string
   values and you compare it against a numeric value, none of the string
   values in the field match the numeric. Likewise, if your field has
   numeric values and you compare it against a string value, none of the
   numeric values in the field match the string. Both field and comparison
   values must be strings or integers to match:

   CAPTION:

   Document Name Value of Field docField Type of Field docField Filter
   Condition Field Value Qualifies Filter Condition?
   DOCUMENT1a 23 STRING docField = 23 No
   DOCUMENT1b 23 INT docField = 23 Yes
   DOCUMENT2a 45 INT docField = '45' No
   DOCUMENT2b 45 STRING docField = '45' Yes
   DOCUMENT3 No type due to missing value docField = 23 No
   DOCUMENT4 NULL No type due to NULL value docField = '45' No

   MapR Database does not define a fixed ordering across noncomparable
   types. It sorts the values within comparable types and within each
   noncomparable type, but not across both.

   In the previous example, when sorting on docField, you could obtain the
   following for a sort in ascending order:

   CAPTION:

   Document Name Value of Field docField    Type of Field docField
   DOCUMENT1b    23                      INT
   DOCUMENT2a    45                      INT
   DOCUMENT1a    23                      STRING
   DOCUMENT2b    45                      STRING
   DOCUMENT4     NULL                    No type due to NULL value
   DOCUMENT3                             No type due to missing value

   Note the independent ordering of the integer and string values. Also
   note that for the rows with NULL and missing field values, the row with
   NULL appears before the row with a missing value.
