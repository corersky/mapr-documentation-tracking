Examples: Querying JSON Documents

   This section provides query examples using the OJAI API. The examples
   include querying by document ID, retrieving all documents in a store,
   selecting individual fields, specifying query conditions, and ordering
   your query result. For reference, the examples also include the
   equivalent MapR Database Shell (dbshell) commands.

   If you hover over the right hand side of all code examples, you can use
   the [CopyIcon.png] icon to copy and paste the code.

   You can also download the code examples from github at
