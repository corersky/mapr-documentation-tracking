Deleting JSON Tables

   This topic describes how to delete MapR Database JSON tables using
   either programmatic APIs or dbshell.
     * [1]Java
     * [2]Node.js
     * [3]Python
     * [4]dbshell
     * [5]C#
     * [6]Go

   To delete a table in the Java OJAI client, call an Admin object's
   deleteTable() method and pass, as an argument, the path of the table to
   delete:
public void deleteTable(String tablePath) throws DBException {
    try (Admin admin = MapRDB.newAdmin()) {
        if (admin.tableExists(tablePath)) {
            admin.deleteTable(tablePath);
        }
    }
}

   To delete a table in the Node.js OJAI client, call the
   Connection.deleteStore() method:
connection.deleteStore(table_path)
    then((deleteResponse) => {
        // Process deleteReponse
        ...
    });

   To delete a table in the Python OJAI client, call the
   Connection.delete_store() method:
rc = connection.delete_store(store_path=table_path)

# mapr dbshell
maprdb root:> drop <table path>

   See [7]dbshell drop for additional details.
   To delete a table in the C# OJAI client, call the
   connection.DeleteStore(string storePath) method:
connection.DeleteStore(string storePath);

   To delete a table in the Go OJAI client, call the
   connection.DeleteStore() function:
err := connection.DeleteStore("/store_path")

Permissions Required

   You must have both the readAce and writeAce permissions on the volumes
   where the JSON tables are located to delete it. For information about
   how to set permissions on volumes, see [8]Setting Whole Volume ACEs.
