Permissions on Arrays

   When granting permissions on a field, if the field contains array data,
   you must grant the permission on the array field. This grants access
   not only to array data in the field, but also nested documents and
   scalar data. It is also possible to set permissions on subfields within
   nested documents that are stored in an array.
   Note: This topic describes the behavior of permissions in MapR Database
   version 6.1 and later, regardless of the MapR version you used to grant
   the permissions. To understand how permissions on arrays behave in
   earlier releases, see [1]Operational Changes (MapR 6.1.0) - Permissions
   on Arrays in MapR Database JSON.

Granting Permissions on Array Elements

   Suppose you have the following documents where person is:
     * An array of nested documents in document id001
     * A single nested document in document id002
     * A scalar value in document id003

{
    "_id" : "id001",
    "person" : [
        {"name" : {"last" : "Smith", "first" : "John"}},
        {"name" : {"last" : "Subramanium", "first" : "Ananya"}}
    ]
}
{
    "_id" : "id002",
    "person" : {"name" : {"last" : "Doe", "first" : "Jane"}}
}
{
    "_id" : "id003",
    "person" : "Unknown"
}

   If you grant a user read permission on the array person[], that user
   can read every field in every nested document within the array in
   document id001. The permission also enables the user to read the person
   field in documents id002 and id003.

   If you receive an error when trying to grant permission on person[]
   because you previously granted permission on person, then you (or an
   administrator with the appropriate permissions) must first remove the
   existing permission on person. If you expect the schema of the person
   field to evolve to include non-array and array data, then you should
   grant the permission on person[] rather than person, to avoid having to
   remove the conflicting person permission.

   You cannot grant permissions on individual elements in an array; for
   example: person[1]. Granting permission on an array enables access to
   the entire array.

Granting Permissions on Nested Document Fields in an Array

   If you want to restrict read access to only specific fields in person,
   whether the field is an array of nested documents or a single nested
   document, perform the following steps:
    1. Deny the user read permission on the array person[].
    2. Grant the user traverse permission on the array person[].
    3. Grant the user read permission on the specific fields.

   For example, to grant the user read permission on only the first names
   in the nested documents, for the third step, grant read permission on
   person[].name.first. The permission enables the user to read the field
   in all nested documents in documents id001 and id002.

   If permissions already exist on person.name.first and you attempt to
   define permissions on person[].name.first, the attempt fails. You (or
   an administrator with the appropriate permissions) must first remove
   the existing permission on person.name.first. Similar to the scenario
   described in the previous section, if you expect the schema of the
   person field to evolve to include individual nested documents as well
   as arrays of nested documents, then you should grant the permission on
   person[].name.first to avoid having to remove the conflicting
   permission.

   If you already have permissions on person[].name.first, then attempting
   to define permissions on person.name.first fails. There is no need to
   add this permission.
