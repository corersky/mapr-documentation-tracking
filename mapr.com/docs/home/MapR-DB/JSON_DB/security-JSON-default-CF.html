Permissions on the Default Column Family

   If a JSON document field is in the MapR Database JSON default column
   family, you must have readperm and writeperm permissions to perform
   read and write operations on the field. You either receive the
   permissions from the default column family, inherit them from the
   field's parent field, or have the permissions from an explicit grant on
   the field.

   The following diagram shows a JSON document where all fields are in the
   default column family.

Granting Read and Write Permissions on Field c

   To perform both read and write operations on field c, when it is in the
   default column family, you must have both readperm and writeperm access
   on field c:
     * If you have readperm and writeperm permissions on the default
       column family, then you have access to field c.
     * If you have readperm and writeperm permissions on field b, then you
       have access to field c. You do not need any further permissions.
       Field c inherits your readperm and writeperm permissions from field
       b.
     * If you have readperm and writeperm permissions on the default
       column family but either field a or b denied you permissions:
          + You must have traverseperm permission granted to you on the
            field that denied you access (field a or b).
          + You must have readperm and writeperm permissions explicitly
            granted to you on field c.
     * If you do not have readperm and writeperm permissions on the
       default column family:
          + You must have traverseperm permission granted to you on either
            the default column family or field b.
          + You must have readperm and writeperm permissions explicitly
            granted to you on field c.

   The following are examples of commands that grant these permissions:
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table >
  -cfname default
  -name a.b
  -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table >
  -cfname default
  -name a.b.c
  -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
  -writeperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf edit
  -path <path to JSON table >
  -cfname default
  -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table >
  -cfname default
  -name a.b.c
  -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
  -writeperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

Granting Read or Write Permission on Field c

   To perform either read or write operations on field c, when it is in
   the default column family, you must have either readperm or writeperm
   access on field c:
     * If you have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on the
       default column family, then you have access to field c.
     * If you have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on field b,
       then you have access to field c. You do not need any further
       permissions. Field c inherits your readperm or writeperm permission
       from field b.
     * If you have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on the
       default column family but either field a or b denied you
       permission:
          + You must have traverseperm permission granted to you on the
            field that denied you access (field a or b).
          + You must have readperm or writeperm permission explicitly
            granted to you on field c.
     * If you do not have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on
       the default column family:
          + You must have the traverseperm permission granted to you on
            either the default column family or field b.
          + You must have readperm or writeperm permission explicitly
            granted to you on field c.

   The following example grants traverseperm permission:
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table>
  -cfname default
  -name a.b
  -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

   The following example grants readperm permission:
maprcli table cf colperm set
  -path <path to JSON table>
  -cfname default
  -name a.b.c
  -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
