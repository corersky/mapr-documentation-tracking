OJAI Query Conditions Using Container Field Paths

   Starting in MapR 6.1, MapR Database supports the notion of a container
   field path. A container field path enables you to perform comparisons
   on a field path that is either a single value or an arbitrary array
   element. You can use container field paths with arrays and nested
   documents, including nested documents with multiple levels of nesting
   and multidimensional arrays.

Conditions with Container Field Paths on Arrays

   If you have a field that has a single value rather than an array of
   values, when using the container notation, MapR Database treats the
   single value as an array with one element. This enables you to use a
   container field path to access a field that has both array elements and
   scalar values. The array elements and scalar values can be of any type.

   Suppose you have the following set of documents:
{ "_id" : "001", "name" : "Ipod 001", "tags" : [ "electronics", "ipod", "apple"
] }
{ "_id" : "002", "name" : "Ipod 002", "tags" : "ipod" }
{ "_id" : "003", "name" : "Ipod 003", "tags" : 10 }
{ "_id" : "004", "name" : "Ipod 004", "tags" : [ 10, "ipod", { "t" : "ipod" } ]
}
{ "_id" : "005", "name" : "Ipod 005", "tags" : { "t" : "ipod" } }
{ "_id" : "006", "name" : "Ipod 006", "tags" : [ { "t" : "ipod" }, { "t" : "appl
e" } ] }
{ "_id" : "007", "name" : "Ipod 007", "tags" : [ { "t" : "ipod", "v" : 10 }, { "
t" : "apple", "v" : 9 } ] }
{ "_id" : "008", "name" : "Ipod 008", "tags" : { "t" : "ipod", "v" : 10 } }

   To find all documents that contain the tag named "ipod", you can use
   the following OJAI query condition, where you reference tags using a
   container field path:
{"$eq":{"tags[]":"ipod"}}

   The expression matches the following documents, with the matching
   condition highlighted in bold:
{ "_id" : "001", "name" : "Ipod 001", "tags" : [ "electronics", "ipod", "apple"
] }
{ "_id" : "002", "name" : "Ipod 002", "tags" : "ipod" }
{ "_id" : "004", "name" : "Ipod 004", "tags" : [ 10, "ipod", { "t" : "ipod" } ]
}

   Note that the matching documents have the following characteristics:
     * In 001 and 004, tags are array fields.
     * In 002, tags is a scalar value.
     * In 001 and 004, the tags arrays have elements in addition to
       "ipod".

   You can also use the AND operator to match multiple container field
   path conditions.

   For example, the following condition finds all documents that have both
   "ipod" and "apple" tags:
{
    "$and":[
        {"$eq":{"tags[]":"ipod"}},
        {"$eq":{"tags[]":"apple"}}
    ]
}

   The expression matches the following document, with the matching
   conditions highlighted in bold:
{ "_id" : "001", "name" : "Ipod 001", "tags" : [ "electronics", "ipod", "apple"
]

Conditions with Container Field Paths on Nested Documents

   You can also use the container field path in combination with a nested
   document subfield reference.

   For example, using the same set of documents shown earlier, the
   following OJAI query condition finds all documents in which "ipod" is
   specified in the subfield named t within the tags nested document:
{"$eq":{"tags[].t":"ipod"}}

   This expression returns the following documents, with the matching
   condition highlighted in bold:
{ "_id" : "004", "name" : "Ipod 004", "tags" : [ 10, "ipod", { "t" : "ipod" } ]
}
{ "_id" : "005", "name" : "Ipod 005", "tags" : { "t" : "ipod" } }
{ "_id" : "006", "name" : "Ipod 006", "tags" : [ { "t" : "ipod" }, { "t" : "appl
e" } ] }
{ "_id" : "007", "name" : "Ipod 007", "tags" : [ { "t" : "ipod", "v" : 10 }, { "
t" : "apple", "v" : 9 } ] }
{ "_id" : "008", "name" : "Ipod 008", "tags" : { "t" : "ipod", "v" : 10 } }

   Note that the matching documents have the following characteristics:
     * In 005 and 008, tags is a single nested document.
     * In 006 and 007, tags is an array of nested documents.
     * In 004, the tags array has both scalar data and a nested document.
     * In 004 and 006, the tags array have other array elements that do
       not match the nested document subfield t.

Existence Conditions with Container Field Paths

   [1]Existence Operators check for the existence and non-existence of a
   specified field path. When you use $exists with a container field path,
   the specified field path can be any element in an array.

   Using the same set of documents shown earlier, the following OJAI query
   condition finds all documents where the tags array has a nested
   document with a subfield t:
{"$exists":"tags[].t"}

   The expression matches the following documents with the matching
   condition highlighted in bold:
{"_id":"004","name":"Ipod 004","tags":[10,"ipod",{"t":"ipod"}]}
{"_id":"005","name":"Ipod 005","tags":{"t":"ipod"}}
{"_id":"006","name":"Ipod 006","tags":[{"t":"ipod"},{"t":"apple"}]}
{"_id":"007","name":"Ipod 007","tags":[{"t":"ipod","v":10},{"t":"apple","v":9}]}

   When you use $notexists with a container field path, it matches any
   element in the array that does not meet the existence condition:
{"$notexists":"tags[].t"}

   The expression returns the following documents with the matching
   condition highlighted in bold:
{"_id":"001","name":"Ipod 001","tags":["electronics","ipod","apple"]}
{"_id":"002","name":"Ipod 002","tags":"ipod"}
{"_id":"003","name":"Ipod 003","tags":10}
{"_id":"004","name":"Ipod 004","tags":[10,"ipod",{"t":"ipod"}]}

   Even document 004 has a tags[].t element, the other elements in that
   document's tags array do not; therefore, the document qualifies the
   condition.

Conditions with Container Field Paths Across Multiple Levels of Nested
Documents

   The following are examples of query conditions that match the sample
   document shown at [2]Container Field Paths Across Multiple Levels of
   Nested Documents:
{"$eq":{"projects[].customer.contacts[].emails[].value":"jdoe@gmail.com"}}
{"$eq":{"projects[].customer.contacts[].role":"CEO"}}

Conditions with Container Field Paths on Multidimensional Arrays

   The following examples reference documents that store the high and low
   temperatures for each day in a week. They use a two-dimensional array
   to store this data. The first element of each nested array element is
   the high temperature for a day, and the second element is the low.
   Typically, the two-dimensional array has seven array pairs, one for
   each day of the week. But in cases where data is unavailable, the
   document has only the days available.

   For example, document 002 has a single dimensional array because it has
   data for only one day that week.
{
   "_id" : "001",
   "temps" : [[61,49],[74,51],[75,51],[74,52],[78,54],[75,53],[75,54]],
   "weekOf" : "4/29/2018"
}
{
   "_id" : "002",
   "temps" : [81,60],
   "weekOf" : "5/12/2018"
}
{
   "_id" : "003",
   "temps" : [[80,55],[78,54],[79,54],[77,53],[79,54],[77,54],[78,54]],
   "weekOf" : "5/13/2018"
}

   As described at [3]Container Field Paths with Multidimensional Arrays,
   you can specify a container field path in a dimension only if it does
   not precede a dimension that specifies an explicit element. For
   example, the following condition is not allowed because the first
   dimension specifies a container field path and precedes element 1 in
   the second dimension:
// Invalid condition
{"$ge":{"temps[][1]":60}}

   The following table shows examples of conditions on multidimensional
   arrays that MapR Database supports:

   CAPTION:

             Example          Documents Returned
{"$ge":{"temps[][]":60}}

   Matches documents that have any temperature greater than 60.
     * Documents 001 and 003 match because all days have high temperatures
       above 60.
     * Document 002 matches because day 1 has a low temperature of 60.

   Although temps in this document is a one-dimensional array, the
   container notation treats it as a two-dimensional array.
   001, 002, 003
{"$ge":{"temps[1][]":75}}

   Matches documents that have any temperature greater than 75 on the
   second day of the week
   003
{"$eq":{"temps[]":[78,54]}}

   Matches documents that have a high and low temperature of 78 and 54 on
   the same day.
     * Day 5 from document 001 matches this condition.
     * Days 2 and 7 from document 003 match this condition.
