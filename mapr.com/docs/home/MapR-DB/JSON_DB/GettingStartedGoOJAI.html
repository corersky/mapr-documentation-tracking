Getting Started with the Go OJAI Client

   This section describes the software required to run the Go OJAI client,
   client/server security, and how to specify your connection string. It
   also provides links to documentation that shows you how to write Go
   OJAI applications.

   The Go OJAI client is available starting in the MEP 6.0.0 release.

Software Requirements

   You must have the following software installed to run the client:

   CAPTION:

   Client Software Installation Notes
   Golang 1.10 (or later)
   Go OJAI client Install the client using the following command:
go get github.com/mapr/maprdb-go-client

   You also must have access to the following software:
     * MapR cluster 6.1 or later
     * [1]MapR Data Access Gateway 2.0 or later

   To run a Go OJAI application, you simply need to install and configure
   the MapR Data Access Gateway:
     * [2]Installing the Data Access Gateway Service
     * [3]Modifying Configuration Settings for the Data Access Gateway
       Service

   For some sample code, see
   [4]https://github.com/magpierre/mapr_go_client_mqtt. main.go shows a
   simple Go client that reads from an MQTT messaging protocol and writes
   to a MapR JSON database.

Go OJAI Client Security

   The client supports username/password authentication. The initial
   connection (and token renewal) use these credentials. Subsequent
   communication uses JWT.

   When connecting to a secure MapR cluster, the client uses:
     * X.509 certificates to authenticate with the MapR Data Access
       Gateway
     * TLS v1.2 to encrypt communication between the client and the Data
       Access Gateway

Go OJAI Client Connection String

   The string you use to connect your OJAI client to a MapR cluster must
   have the following format:
"[ojai:mapr:thin:v1@]<hostname>[:<port>][?<option_name>=<option_value>;...]"

   The prefix ojai:mapr:thin:v1@ is optional.

   <hostname>
          Name of the MapR Data Access Gateway host

   <port>
          Port number (see [5]Ports Used by MapR) that gRPC clients use to
          connect to the MapR Data Access Gateway

          Default: 5678

   auth=<scheme_name>
          The authentication scheme for the current connection; currently,
          only basic

   user=<username>
          The user name for basic authentication

   password=<password>
          The password for basic authentication

   ssl=true|false
          Whether to establish a secure connection using SSL/TLS

          An error is returned if there is a mismatch between your client
          and cluster security settings. The default for this option is
          true, which is the required setting if connecting to a secure
          MapR cluster. If connecting to a nonsecure MapR cluster, set it
          to false.

          If set to false, the other SSL parameters are ignored.

   sslCA=<path to PEM file containing CA certificate>
          Path to a local file containing Certificate Authority (CA)
          signed certificates in PEM format.

          Must be set if the ssl option is true.

   sslTargetNameOverride=<CA certificate common name>
          Fully qualified domain name specified in the CA certificate,
          which is different from the <hostname> in the connection string.

          For example, imagine that you are using the following:

          + Public network host name is
            ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com.
          + Internal DNS is node1.mydomain.com.
          + CA signed certificate is issued to node1.mydomain.com.

          Using these names, you must specify the following connection
          string:

"ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5678?ssl=true;sslCA=/opt/app/conf/root
ca.pem;sslTargetNameOverride=node1.mydomain.com"

   Other examples of connection strings are the following:
http://"ojai:mapr:thin:v1@localhost:5768?auth=basic;user=fred;password=george;ss
lCA=/opt/app/conf/rootca.pem"
"localhost:5768?ssl=false;auth=basic;user=fred;password=george"

Go OJAI Connection Retry Options

   If your OJAI client cannot connect to your MapR cluster, it waits 10
   ms. After 10 ms, it makes a second connection attempt. If that fails,
   it continues the attempts up to a configurable number of retries. The
   following parameters control the number of retries and the wait time
   between attempts:
   Connection Option Parameter            Description             Default Value
   MaxAttempt                  Maximum number of retry attempts   9
   WaitBetweenSeconds          Maximum wait time between attempts 12 s
   CallTimeoutSeconds          Maximum call timeout               60 s

   To set these retry options, you must pass them in the
   client.MakeConnectionWithRetryOptions call:
        connectionString := "localhost:5678?" +
                "auth=basic;" +
                "user=mapr;" +
                "password=mapr;" +
                "ssl=true;" +
                "sslCA=/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore.pem;" +
                "sslTargetNameOverride=node1.cluster.com"
        options := &client.ConnectionOptions{MaxAttempt:3, WaitBetweenSeconds:10
, CallTimeoutSeconds:60}
        connection, _ := client.MakeConnectionWithRetryOptions(connectionString,
 options)

Writing a Go OJAI Application

   sections in the following topics:

   [6]Querying in OJAI Applications

          application that queries a MapR Database JSON table

   [7]Examples: Querying JSON Documents
          Contains code samples of OJAI applications that query MapR
          Database JSON tables

   [8]Managing JSON Documents
          Describes how to perform CRUD (create, query, update, and
          delete) operations on JSON documents in MapR Database JSON
          tables
