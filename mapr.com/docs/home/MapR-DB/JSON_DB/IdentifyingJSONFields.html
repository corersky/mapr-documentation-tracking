JSON Document Field Paths

   To access fields in a JSON document, you use a field path. The syntax
   for a field path can vary, depending on the data type you are
   accessing: nested documents, arrays, nested documents within arrays,
   and multidimensional arrays.

   The examples in this topic reference the following sample JSON
   document:
{
    "_id" : "2DT3201",
    "product_ID" : "2DT3201",
    "name" : " Allegro SPD-SL 6800",
    "brand" : "Careen",
    "category" : "Pedals",
    "type" : "Components",
    "price" : 112.99,
    "features" : [
        "Low-profile design",
        "Floating SH11 cleats included"
    ],
    "specifications" : {
        "weight_per_pair" : "260g",
        "color" : "black"
    },
    "comments" : [
        {
            "username" : "hlmencken",
            "comment" : "Best money I ever spent!"
        },
        {
            "username" : "vwoolf",
            "comment" : "What hlmencken said!"
        }
    ]
}

   In the simplest case, the field path is the name of the field and
   refers to the entire field.

Nested Documents

   If a field is a nested document, specifying the nested document
   identifies the entire nested document.

   To identify individual fields in a nested document, you use a dot
   notation to specify their paths. A field path is a sequence of field
   names that leads to the particular field that you are interested in.
   The names are separated by dots.

   The following shows a document with multiple levels of nested
   documents:
{
   "a" : {
       "b" : {
            "c" : {
                "d" : "value_for_d"
            }
        }
    }
}

   The field path for field d using dot notation is a.b.c.d.

   The following table shows examples of field paths using dot notation
   for the sample JSON document:

   CAPTION:

                    Field Path                  Value Returned
   specifications

{
  "specifications":
    {"color":"black","weight_per_pair":"260g"}
}

   The entire nested document field specifications
   specifications.weight_per_pair

{"specifications":{"weight_per_pair":"260g"}}

   The weight_per_pair subfield in specifications
   specifications.color

{"specifications":{"color":"black"}}

   The color subfield in specifications

Arrays

   If the field is an array, specifying the array's field name identifies
   the entire array.

   To access an element in an array, specify the position of the element
   in the array, starting at offset zero.

   The following table shows examples of field paths that reference arrays
   for the sample JSON document:

   CAPTION:

               Field Path             Value Returned
   features

{
  "features":[
    "Low-profile design",
    "Floating SH11 cleats included"
  ]
}

   The entire features array
   features[0]

{"features":["Low-profile design"]}

   The first element of the features array
   features[1]

{
  "features":
    [null,"Floating SH11 cleats included"]
}

   The second element of the features array
   Note: null is shown in the first element of the array to signify that
   the element returned is the second entry from the array.
   comments[0]

{
  "comments":
    [{"comment":"Best money I ever spent!","username":"hlmencken"}]
}

   The first element of the comments array, which is a nested document

Container Field Paths

   Starting in MapR 6.1, MapR Database introduces the notion of a
   container field path. Using a container field path, you can access a
   field that is either a single value or an arbitrary array element.

   If you have a field that has a single value (rather than an array of
   values), when using a container field path, MapR Database treats the
   single value as an array with one element. This enables you to use a
   container field path to access a field that has both array elements and
   scalar values. The array elements and scalar values can be of any type.

   To specify a container field path, place square brackets after the
   field name:
fieldName[]

   A container field path is useful if you want to perform one of the
   following scenarios:
     * Perform comparisons on a field path that is either a single value
       or an arbitrary array element
     * Access subfields in a nested document, where the nested document is
       either an arbitrary array element or a single nested document
     * Access arbitrary elements in an array

   See [1]OJAI Query Conditions Using Container Field Paths for more
   details about the first scenario. The next two sections describes the
   second and third scenarios.

Nested Documents Within Arrays

   Array elements can be nested documents. You can reference individual
   subfields within these nested documents with container field paths,
   starting in MapR 6.1. If you have a field that has a single value
   (rather than an array of values), if you use a container field path,
   MapR Database treats the single value as an array with one element.
   This enables you to use a container field path to access a field that
   has both array elements and scalar values.
   For example, suppose you have the following two JSON documents in a
   MapR Database table, and addresses has an array of nested documents in
   the first document and a nested document in the second document:
{
  "_id":"1",
  "addresses":[
    {"state":"CA","city":"SJ"},
    {"state":"CA","city":"SC"},
    {"state":"WA","street":"NE 39th"}
  ]
}
{
  "_id":"2",
  "addresses":{"state":"CA","city":"SJ"}
}

   You can use addresses[].state to reference the state subfield across
   all nested documents in both documents.

   The following table describes the field paths supported and what each
   field path returns:

   CAPTION:

   Field Path Value Returned

   (Number in Description Corresponds to Document ID)
addresses

{
  "addresses": [
    {"city":"SJ","state":"CA"},
    {"city":"SC","state":"CA"},
    {"state":"WA","street":"NE 39th"}]
}
{
  "addresses":{"city":"SJ","state":"CA"}
}
    1. The array containing three nested documents
    2. The single nested document

addresses.city

{}
{"addresses":{"city":"SJ"}}
    1. Empty because addresses is not a nested document
    2. The city subfield in the nested document

addresses[0]

{
  "addresses":
    [{"city":"SJ","state":"CA"}]
}
{}
    1. The first element in the addresses array
    2. Empty because addresses is not an array

addresses[2].state

{
  "addresses":
    [null,null,{"state":"WA"}]
}
{}
    1. The state subfield from the nested document in the third element of
       the addresses array
       Note: null is shown in the first two elements of the array to
       signify that the element returned is the third entry from the array
    2. Empty because addresses is not an array

addresses[0].state,
addresses[0].city

{"addresses":[{"city":"SJ","state":"CA"}]}
{}
    1. The city and state subfields from the nested document
    2. Empty because addresses is not an array

addresses[].city

   Note: Supported starting in MapR 6.1
{
  "addresses":
    [
      {"city":"SJ"},
      {"city":"SC"},
      {}
    ]
}
{
  "addresses":
    {"city":"SJ"}
}
    1. An array of nested documents with a city subfield; the third array
       element is empty because the third nested document does not have a
       city subfield
    2. A single nested document with a city subfield

addresses[].state,
addresses[].city

   Note: Supported starting in MapR 6.1
{
  "addresses":
    [
      {"city":"SJ","state":"CA"},
      {"city":"SC","state":"CA"},
      {"state":"WA"}
    ]
}
{
  "addresses":
    {"city":"SJ","state":"CA"}
}
    1. An array of nested documents with city and state subfields; the
       third array element has only a state subfield because the third
       nested document does not have a city subfield
    2. A single nested document with city and state subfields

   Container Field Paths Across Multiple Levels of Nested Documents

   You can use container field paths at any level of a nested document.

   For example, suppose you have the following document:
{
   "_id": "account001",
   "projects": [
      {
         "id": "proj001",
         "manager": { "name": "Guy Bones", "email": "gbones@pro.com" },
         "customer": {
            "name": "My Company",
            "contacts": [
               {
               "id": "user_jdoe",
               "emails": [
                  { "type": "work", "value": "jdoe@comp.com" },
                  { "type": "personal", "value": "jdoe@gmail.com" }
               ],
               "addresses": [
                  {
                     "type": "work",
                     "value": {"street":"21 King Av","city": "Redwood", "zip": 9
4065, "state": "CA" }
                  }
               ],
               "phones": [
                  { "type": "cell", "value": "+16505556764" },
                  { "type": "office", "value": "+14075556764" }],
               "role": "CEO"
               },
               {
               "id": "user_simsom",
               "emails": [
                  { "type": "work", "value": "simson@comp.com" },
                  { "type": "personal", "value": "simson@gmail.com" }
               ],
               "addresses": [
                  {
                  "type": "work",
                  "value": {"street":"21 King Av.","city":"Redwood","zip": 94065
,"state": "CA" }
                  }
               ],
               "phones": [
                  { "type": "cell", "value": "+16505556777" },
                  { "type": "office", "value": "+1407555444" }],
               "role": "PM"
               }
            ]
         }
      },
      {
         "id": "proj002",
         // ...
      }
   ]
}

   The following table shows field paths that use the container field
   paths across multiple nested documents and the values returned:

   CAPTION:

                    Field Path                  Value Returned
   projects[].customer.contacts[].emails[].value

{
  "projects":[
    {
    "customer":{
      "contacts":[
        {
          "emails":[
            {"value":"jdoe@comp.com"},
            {"value":"jdoe@gmail.com"}
          ]
        },
        {
          "emails":[
            {"value":"simson@comp.com"},
            {"value":"simson@gmail.com"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    { // data for proj002 }
  ]
}

   projects[].customer.contacts[].role

{
  "projects":[
    {
      "customer":
        {
          "contacts":[
            {"role":"CEO"},
            {"role":"PM"}
          ]
        }
    },
    { // data for proj002 }
  ]
}

Multidimensional Arrays

   Arrays can have more than one dimension.

   For example, suppose you want to store the high and low temperatures by
   week. The following document contains the high and low temperatures in
   Fahrenheit for the seven days beginning on April 29th, 2018. The
   document uses a two-dimensional array to store the high and low
   temperatures for each day. The first element of each nested array
   element is the high temperature for a day, and the second element is
   the low:
{
   "_id" : "001",
   "temps" : [[61,49],[74,51],[75,51],[74,52],[78,54],[75,53],[75,54]],
   "weekOf" : "4/29/2018"
}

   To access individual high or low temperatures by day, you specify a
   two-dimensional array element with the desired array indexes. To access
   a pair of high and low temperatures, you specify a single array index.

   CAPTION:

                     Field Path                  Value Returned
   temps[0]

   {"temps":[[61,49]]}

   temps[5][1]

{"temps":[null,null,null,null,null,[null,53]]}

   Note: null is shown for all array elements preceding the desired
   element

   There is no limit on the number of dimensions in an array.

   Container Field Paths with Multidimensional Arrays

   Starting in MapR 6.1, a container field path can refer to arbitrary
   array elements across multiple array dimensions. To reference arbitrary
   elements in the two-dimensional temps array shown earlier, you specify:
temps[][]

   Extending the convention by which a container field path with one set
   of square brackets treats a scalar value as an array with one element,
   a container field path with two square brackets treats a
   one-dimensional array as a two-dimensional array with a single element,
   where the element is that one-dimensional array.

   For example, in the following document, although temps has only a
   single array, you can use temps[][] to refer to either the high or low
   temperature in the array:
{
   "_id" : "002",
   "temps" : [81,60],
   "weekOf" : "5/12/2018"
}

   The same convention applies across N dimensions. A container field path
   with N square brackets treats an (N-1)-dimensional array as the only
   element in an N-dimensional array.

   You can also use the container field paths for a subset of dimensions,
   provided a dimension that specifies container field path does not
   precede a dimension that specifies an explicit element. The following
   table illustrates this:

   CAPTION:

   Field Path Value Returned
temps[0][]

{"temps":[[61,49]]}
{"temps":[81,60]}

   The temperatures on the first day of the week
temps[2][]

{"temps":[null,null,[75,51]]}
{"temps":[]}

   The temperatures on the third day of the week
temps[]

{"temps":[[61,49],[74,51],[75,51],[74,52],[78,54],[75,53],[75,54]]}
{"temps":[81,60]}

   The temperature pairs across all days
temps[][0]

   Disallowed because the container field path in the first dimension
   precedes element 0 in the second dimension
