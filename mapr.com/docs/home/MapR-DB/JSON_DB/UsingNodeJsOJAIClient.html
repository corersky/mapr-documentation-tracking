Using the Node.js OJAI Client

   Starting with MEP 6.0, you can use the Node.js OJAI client to write
   MapR Database JSON applications. The client provides you with a
   lightweight library that supports the OJAI API. You can connect to MapR
   Database JSON from middleware components, and add, update, and query
   documents in a MapR Database JSON table.

   The client provides you with the following benefits:
     * Easy installation and use
     * Access to MapR Database JSON through the OJAI interface in Node.js
     * An OJAI interface that is tailored to Node.js developers
     * Support for Callback and Promise/Async Node.js asynchronous
       programming models
     * Support for L3/L4 (transport level) and L7 (application level)
       proxy load balancing
     * Use of JavaScript to manipulate MapR Database JSON documents

   To use the Node.js OJAI client, you must install the [1]MapR Data
   Access Gateway on your MapR cluster. The gateway serves as a proxy for
   translating requests between the Node.js client and the MapR cluster.
   The gateway also performs data processing to keep the client
   lightweight. See [2]Administering the MapR Data Access Gateway for
   information about how to administer the gateway and configure load
   balancing.
   Important: MapR does not support running the Node.js OJAI client in a
   web browser.
