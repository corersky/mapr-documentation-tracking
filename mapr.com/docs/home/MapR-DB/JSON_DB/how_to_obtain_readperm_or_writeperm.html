Obtaining readperm or writeperm on Fields

   In this scenario, you want to perform an operation on a field, and the
   operation requires that you have readperm or writeperm permissions on
   that field. How you obtain either permission depends on whether the
   field is in the default column family or a non-default column family.

When the field is in the default column family

   In the document below, you want to perform an operation on field c,
   which is in the default column family. The operation requires you to
   have readperm or writeperm on field c.

   in the default column family

   Case 1: You have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on the
          default column family
          In this case, field c inherits the permission, assuming that the
          permission was not denied on field a or b.

          If you do not have readperm or writeperm on field a or b, you
          need traverseperm on the field that denied you the permission
          that you need. You also need readperm or writeperm explicitly
          granted to you on field c.

          Example commands to grant these permissions:

maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table> -cfname
default -name a.b -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

          The next example command grants readperm:

maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table> -cfname
default -name a.b.c -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

   Case 2: You do not have the same permission (readperm or writeperm) on
          the default column family
          In this case, you need the traverseperm permission on the
          default column family. You also need readperm or writeperm
          explicitly granted to you on field c.

          Example commands to grant these permissions:

maprcli table cf edit -path <path to JSON table> -cfname cf1
-traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

          This next example command grants readperm:

maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table> -cfname cf1
-name a.b.c -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

When the field is in a non-default column family

   Note: Non-default column families are an advanced feature of MapR-DB's
   native JSON support. For information about them, see [1]Column Families
   in JSON Tables.

   In the document below, you want to perform an operation on field c,
   which is in the column family that is defined at field b with the path
   a.b. The operation requires you to have readperm or writeperm on field
   c.

   are in a column family that has the path a.b

   Case 1: You do not have the permission you need (readperm or writeperm)
          on field b
          You need traverseperm on field b, and you need readperm or
          writeperm granted to you explicitly on field c.

          Example commands to grant these permissions:

maprcli table cf edit -path <path to JSON table> -cfname cf1
-traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table> -cfname cf1
-name a.b.c -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

   Case 2: You do have the permission you need (readperm or writeperm) on
          field b
          You do not need any further permissions. Field c inherits your
          readperm and writeperm permissions from field b.
