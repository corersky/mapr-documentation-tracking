Using the MapR Database JSON REST API

   Starting in the MEP 5.0 release, you can use a REST API to access MapR
   Database JSON tables. The REST API allows you to use HTTP calls to
   perform basic operations on MapR Database JSON tables.

   The API supports the following operations:
     * Create and delete MapR Database JSON tables
     * Insert, update, and delete documents from a table
     * Retrieve documents while specifying filter conditions and
       projections

   The REST API has the following characteristics:
     * Operations are stateless
     * Operations are synchronous
     * Request responses are not buffered
     * Web connections are secure when connecting to secure MapR clusters
     * Supports the following methods of authentication:
          + Basic authentication
          + Token-based authentication using [1]JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
     * [2]Supports user impersonation - All data access calls are run on
       behalf of the authenticated user
     * Returns HTTP error codes and detailed error responses in the
       response message body

   When connecting to a MapR cluster, you must use HTTPS in your requests.

   With basic authentication, you pass a username and password in your Web
   client. With token based authentication, you generate a token and then
   pass the token in the header of subsequent API requests.

   The [3]MapR Data Access Gateway is the service that supports this web
   API. You should configure multiple instances of this service across
   your MapR cluster to distribute request processing. To achieve load
   balancing, you must install an external load balancer. Using token
   based authentication and an external load balancer, you can achieve
   high availability and failover. Because the REST API is stateless, you
   do not have to regenerate your authentication token when different
   service instances process your API request. This applies even in the
   event of failovers and service restart. You must regenerate your token
   when it expires.

   The API does not support the following features:
     * MapR Database JSON administrative commands, except the commands
       noted earlier
     * [4]Read Your Own Writes

   To modify properties that the MapR Database JSON REST API uses, see
   [5]Application Properties.
