Using Indexes to Optimize Range Conditions

   Indexes can improve the performance of queries that have range
   conditions. The range conditions can appear in combination with
   equality conditions when the most significant index keys have equality
   conditions. You can define indexes that optimize range conditions on
   scalar data fields and container field paths.

   The following range condition operators benefit from indexes:
     * Less than (or equal to)
     * Greater than (or equal to)
     * Pattern matching operator LIKE, provided the pattern in the
       condition does not start with a wildcard character

   Assume you have a MapR Database JSON table with documents in the
   following format:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
        {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
        {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
        {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

   The examples in the following sections reference this sample JSON
   document.

Indexes on Scalar Data Fields in Range Conditions

   The following table provides examples of when MapR Database can and
   cannot use the index with range conditions on scalar data. Assume that
   a [1]composite index exists on the Address.State and Address.City
   fields. To use both indexed fields in the composite index, you must
   have an equality condition on Address.State.

   CAPTION:

   Filter Condition How MapR Database Uses the Index
{"$le":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Reads from the beginning of the index up to and including the condition
   Address.State <= "CA".
{"$gt":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State > "CA"
   through the end of the index.
{"$like":{"Address.State":"C%"}}

   Performs a simple prefix match starting at the condition Address.State
   >= "C". Continues reading the index until the filter no longer
   qualifies.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$ge":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State = "CA" and
   Address.City >= "Oak". Continues reading from the index until the
   condition Address.State = "CA" no longer qualifies.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$in":{"Address.State":["CA","NY","MA"]}},
    {"$gt":{"Address.City":"Spring"}}
  ]
}

   Performs these three lookups and reads through the index:
     * Address.State = "CA" and Address.City > "Spring"
     * Address.State = "NY" and Address.City > "Spring"
     * Address.State = "MA" and Address.City > "Spring"

{
  "$and":[
    {"$gt":{"Address.State":"C"}},
    {"$gt":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State > "C"
   through the end of the index.

   Although Address.City is part of the index key, MapR Database does not
   use Address.City > "Oak" when initiating the index search. Applies that
   filter while reading the index.
{"$le":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}

   Even if the query references the field Address.State, MapR Database
   cannot use the index unless there is also an equality condition on the
   prefix key of the index, Address.State.

Indexes on Container Field Paths in Range Conditions

   Starting in MapR 6.1, you can define an index using a container field
   path as the indexed field.

   For example, suppose you want to apply range conditions on individual
   hobbies within the Hobbies array field. You can define an index on the
   following field:
Hobbies[]

   The following examples show range conditions that benefit from this
   index:

   CAPTION:

   Query Condition Description
{"$like":{"Hobbies[]":"B%"}}

   Finds documents that contain hobbies that start with the letter "B"
{"$gt":{"Hobbies[]":"Read"}}

   Finds documents that contain hobbies with a value greater than "Read"
{
    "$elementAnd":{
        "Hobbies[]":[
            {"$ge":{"$":"D"}},
            {"$lt":{"$":"J"}
        ]
    }
}

   Finds documents that contain hobbies that start with letters between
   "D" and "I", inclusive

   When using the Hobbies[] container field path in the query condition,
   the condition matches both array elements and individual scalar values.

   For another example, suppose you want to apply range filters on phone
   numbers. You can define an index on the following field:
Phones[].Number

   The following examples show range conditions that benefit from this
   index:

   CAPTION:

                            Query Condition                          Description
   {"$like":{"Phones[].Number":"555%"}}

   Finds documents with phone numbers that have a 555 prefix
{
    "$elementAnd":{
        "Phones[]":[
            {"$gt":{"Number":"408-555-1234"}},
            {"$lt":{"Number":"408-555-9999"}
        ]
    }
}

   Finds documents that contain phone numbers in the specified range

   When using the Phones[].Number container field path in the query
   condition, the condition matches instances where Phones is an array of
   nested documents as well as a single document.
