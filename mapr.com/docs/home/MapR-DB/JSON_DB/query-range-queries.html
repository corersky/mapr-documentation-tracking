Using Indexes to Optimize Range Conditions

   Indexes can improve the performance of queries that have range
   conditions. The range conditions can appear in combination with
   equality conditions when the most significant index keys have equality
   conditions. You can define indexes that optimize range conditions on
   scalar data fields.

   The following range condition operators benefit from indexes:
     * Less than (or equal to)
     * Greater than (or equal to)
     * Pattern matching operator LIKE, provided the pattern in the
       condition does not start with a wildcard character

   Assume you have a MapR-DB JSON table with documents in the following
   format:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
        {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
        {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
        {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

   document.

Indexes on Scalar Data Fields

   The following table provides examples of when MapR-DB can and cannot
   use the index with range conditions on scalar data. Assume that a
   [1]composite index exists on the Address.State and Address.City fields.
   To use both indexed fields in the composite index, you must have an
   equality condition on Address.State.
   Filter Condition How MapR-DB Uses the Index
{"$le":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Reads from the beginning of the index up to and including the condition
   Address.State <= "CA".
{"$gt":{"Address.State":"CA"}}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State > "CA"
   through the end of the index.
{"$like":{"Address.State":"C%"}}

   Performs a simple prefix match starting at the condition Address.State
   >= "C". Continues reading the index until the filter no longer
   qualifies.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$eq":{"Address.State":"CA"}},
    {"$ge":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State = "CA" and
   Address.City >= "Oak". Continues reading from the index until the
   condition Address.State = "CA" no longer qualifies.
{
  "$and":[
    {"$in":{"Address.State":["CA","NY","MA"]}},
    {"$gt":{"Address.City":"Spring"}}
  ]
}

   Performs these three lookups and reads through the index:
     * Address.State = "CA" and Address.City > "Spring"
     * Address.State = "NY" and Address.City > "Spring"
     * Address.State = "MA" and Address.City > "Spring"

{
  "$and":[
    {"$gt":{"Address.State":"C"}},
    {"$gt":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}
  ]
}

   Reads from the index starting at the condition Address.State > "C"
   through the end of the index.

   Although Address.City is part of the index key, MapR-DB does not use
   Address.City > "Oak" when initiating the index search. Applies that
   filter while reading the index.
{"$le":{"Address.City":"Oak"}}

   Even if the query references the field Address.State, MapR-DB cannot
   use the index unless there is also an equality condition on the prefix
   key of the index, Address.State.
