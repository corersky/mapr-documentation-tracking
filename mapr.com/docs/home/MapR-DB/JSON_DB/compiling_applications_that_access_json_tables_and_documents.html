Compiling and Running Java OJAI Applications

   For applications that use the Java OJAI API, use Maven to compile and
   determine the application's dependencies. Then, when you run the
   application, specify those dependencies in the application's classpath.

Compile and Determine Dependencies

   Use Maven to compile and determine the application dependencies.
    1. Add MapR's Maven repository to your pom.xml file, if it is not
       already added:
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>mapr-releases</id>
        <url>http://repository.mapr.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases</url
>
        <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
        <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
    </repository>
</repositories>
    2. Add a dependency to the MapR OJAI driver project:
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.mapr.ojai</groupId>
        <artifactId>mapr-ojai-driver</artifactId>
        <version>6.0.0-mapr</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
       Note: Replace the <version> property with the MapR Database version
       that you are using.
    3. Use Maven to compile the application and resolve dependencies.

Run the Application

   When you develop a Java application, you can use a dependency
   management tool such as Maven to compile your application. However, it
   is recommended that do the following instead:
    1. Compile the Java application without including dependencies
    2. Specify the required classpath when you submit the application to
       the cluster

   If you choose to bundle the JAR file, and there is a mismatch between
   the bundled JAR file and the version that your MapR cluster expects,
   this can result in failures. The failures differ depending on the
   version of MapR you are using. For more information, see [1]Using the
   MapR Filesystem JAR to Connect to the Cluster.

   When the cluster is secure, the node must also have a MapR ticket
   configured for the user that runs the application.
   You can use the following command to launch MapR Database JSON
   applications:
java -cp <classpath>:. -Djava.library.path=/opt/mapr/lib <main class JAR> <comma
nd line arguments>

Enable OJAI Tracing

   To help debug your Java OJAI application, you can enable OJAI tracing.
   MapR uses the log4j API to log tracing messages. To enable writing
   these messages to standard output, follow these steps:
    1. Set the following property in your /opt/mapr/conf/log4j.properties
       file:
log4j.logger.com.mapr.ojai.store.impl=TRACE, stdout
    2. Add the following to your java launch command:
          + In your java classpath, add the library that includes custom
            MapR log4j classes:
-cp /opt/mapr/lib/central-logging-6.1.0-mapr.jar:<other classpaths>:.
          + Define the location of the log4j.properties file:
-Dlog4j.configuration=file:/opt/mapr/conf/log4j.properties
