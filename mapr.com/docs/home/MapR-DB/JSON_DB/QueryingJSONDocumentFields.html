OJAI Query Condition Syntax

   OJAI defines a syntax for specifying query conditions that allows you
   to express query conditions in a JSON format. This topic describes the
   supported operators and provides examples of these query conditions.

   When writing an OJAI application, you can also apply query conditions
   by calling OJAI API methods, corresponding to specific operators. This
   section does not discuss this alternative. For details on that
   alternative, see [1]Query Conditions in OJAI Applications.
