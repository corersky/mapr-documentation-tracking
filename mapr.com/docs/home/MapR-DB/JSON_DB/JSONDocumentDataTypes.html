JSON Document Data Types

   MapR Database JSON documents support a richer set of data types beyond
   what JSON supports. JSON documents can have scalar data, nested
   documents, and arrays.

Scalar Data

   Scalar data fields can contain strings or numbers. The scalar fields in
   the sample document are highlighted in bold below:
{
    "_id" : "2DT3201",
    "product_ID" : "2DT3201",
    "name" : " Allegro SPD-SL 6800",
    "brand" : "Careen",
    "category" : "Pedals",
    "type" : "Components",
    "price" : 112.99,
    "features" : [
        "Low-profile design",
        "Floating SH11 cleats included"
    ],
    "specifications" : {
        "weight_per_pair" : "260g",
        "color" : "black"
    },
    "comments" : [
        {
            "username" : "hlmencken",
            "comment" : "Best money I ever spent!"
        },
        {
            "username" : "vwoolf",
            "comment" : "What hlmencken said!"
        }
    ]
}

   Scalar fields can contain the following data types:

   CAPTION:

   Data Type Description
   Binary An uninterpreted sequence of bytes
   Boolean A data type of two possible values that are typically denoted
   by true and false
   Byte A 8-bit signed integer that ranges in value from -128 to 127
   Date A 32-bit integer representing the number of DAYS since epoch, i.e.
   January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. The value is absolute and is time-zone
   independent.
   Double A double-precision 64-bit floating-point number
   Float A single-precision 32-bit floating-point number
   Int A 32-bit signed integer that ranges in value from −2,147,483,648 to
   2,147,483,647
   Long A 64-bit signed integer that ranges in value from -(2^63) to 2^63
   - 1
   Short A 16-bit signed integer that ranges in value from −32,768 to
   32,767
   String A sequence of characters
   Time A 32-bit integer representing time of the day in milliseconds. The
   value is absolute and is time-zone independent.
   Timestamp A 64-bit integer representing the number of milliseconds
   since epoch, i.e. January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Negative values
   represent dates before epoch.

Nested Documents

   Nested document fields can contain documents that themselves contain
   scalar data, nested documents, arrays, or a combination of any of these
   types. The nested documents in the sample document are highlighted in
   bold below:
{
    "_id" : "2DT3201",
    "product_ID" : "2DT3201",
    "name" : " Allegro SPD-SL 6800",
    "brand" : "Careen",
    "category" : "Pedals",
    "type" : "Components",
    "price" : 112.99,
    "features" : [
        "Low-profile design",
        "Floating SH11 cleats included"
    ],
    "specifications" : {
        "weight_per_pair" : "260g",
        "color" : "black"
    },
    "comments" : [
        {
            "username" : "hlmencken",
            "comment" : "Best money I ever spent!"
        },
        {
            "username" : "vwoolf",
            "comment" : "What hlmencken said!"
        }
    ]
}

   Note: Nested documents can also be referred to as maps.

   A nested document can include subfields that are themselves nested
   documents. In the following example, location is a nested document that
   has two nested document subfields, address and geoCoordinates:
{
   "_id": "001",
   "location": {
      "address": {
         "number": 100,
         "street": "Main St.",
         "city": "San Francisco",
         "state": "CA",
         "zipCode": "90210"
      },
      "geoCoordinates": {
         "latitude": 37.7817529521,
         "longitude": -122.39612197
      }
   }
}

   There is no limit on the number of nestings in a nested document. You
   should consider the extra complexity additional nestings may add to
   your applications.

Arrays

   Array fields contain lists of values that are accessible by means of
   index numbers. The values can be scalar, nested documents, arrays, or a
   combination of any of these types. For example, the following document
   has two arrays, both highlighted in bold:
     * features: An array with two scalar strings
     * comments: An array with two nested documents

{
    "_id" : "2DT3201",
    "product_ID" : "2DT3201",
    "name" : " Allegro SPD-SL 6800",
    "brand" : "Careen",
    "category" : "Pedals",
    "type" : "Components",
    "price" : 112.99,
    "features" : [
        "Low-profile design",
        "Floating SH11 cleats included"
    ],
    "specifications" : {
        "weight_per_pair" : "260g",
        "color" : "black"
    },
    "comments" : [
        {
            "username" : "hlmencken",
            "comment" : "Best money I ever spent!"
        },
        {
            "username" : "vwoolf",
            "comment" : "What hlmencken said!"
        }
    ]
}

   Note: Arrays can also be referred to as lists.
