OJAI Query Condition Examples

   This section contains examples that show you how to use different OJAI
   query condition operators in combination with different field
   references and data types.

   The examples in this section use the following JSON documents:
{ "_id" : "001", "name" : "Ipod 001", "tags" : [ "electronics", "ipod", "apple"
] }
{ "_id" : "002", "name" : "Ipod 002", "tags" : "ipod" }
{ "_id" : "003", "name" : "Ipod 003", "tags" : 10 }
{ "_id" : "004", "name" : "Ipod 004", "tags" : [ 10, "ipod", { "t" : "ipod" } ]
}
{ "_id" : "005", "name" : "Ipod 005", "tags" : { "t" : "ipod" } }
{ "_id" : "006", "name" : "Ipod 006", "tags" : [ { "t" : "ipod" }, { "t" : "appl
e" } ] }
{ "_id" : "007", "name" : "Ipod 007", "tags" : [ { "t" : "ipod", "v" : 10 }, { "
t" : "apple", "v" : 9 } ] }
{ "_id" : "008", "name" : "Ipod 008", "tags" : { "t" : "ipod", "v" : 10 } }

                       Example                    Documents Returned
{"$exists":"tags.v"}

   Matches documents where tags is a nested document that has a v
   subfield.
   008
{"$eq":{"tags":10}}

   Matches documents where tags equals the scalar value 10.
   003
{"$eq":{"tags.t":"ipod"}}

   Matches documents where tags is a nested document with a subfield t
   equal to "ipod".
   005, 008
{"$eq":{"tags":{"t":"ipod"}}}

   Matches documents where tags is a nested document with a single
   subfield t equal to "ipod".
   005
{"$eq":{"tags":{"v":10,"t":"ipod"}}}

   Matches documents where tags is a nested document with two subfields, v
   and t. v is equal to 10, and t is equal to "ipod". The order of
   subfields in the condition does not matter.
   008
{"$eq":{"tags":["electronics","ipod","apple"]}}

   Matches documents where tags is an array with the three elements
   listed.
   001
{"$eq":{"tags":["ipod","electronics","apple"]}}

   This example does not match any document, whereas the previous does,
   because the order of the elements in this example does not match the
   order in document 001.
   None
{"$between":{"tags":[5,15]}}

   Matches documents where tags is a scalar value between 5 and 15.
   003
{"$like":{"tags[1]":"ip%"}}

   Matches documents where the first array element in tags qualifies the
   wildcard string "ip%"
   001, 004
{"$typeof":{"tags":"map"}}

   Matches documents where tags is a nested document.
   005, 008
{"$typeof":{"tags":"array"}}

   Matches documents where tags is an array.
   001, 004, 006, 007
{"$sizeof":{"tags":{"$ge":3}}}

   Matches documents where the size of the data in tags is greater than or
   equal to three.
     * 001 matches because the array has three elements
     * 002 matches because the string is of length four
     * 004 matches because the nested document has three subfields

   001, 002, 004
{"$in":{"tags":["ipod", 10, {"t":"ipod"}]}}

   Matches documents where tags equals any of the values listed. Note that
   the values can be of different types.
   002, 003, 005
{
    "$and":[
        {"$lt":{"tags[1].v":10}},
        {"$matches":{"tags[1].t":"ap{2}"}}
    ]
}

   Matches documents where the first array element in tags has a nested
   document with a subfield v less than one, and the same nested document
   also matches the regular expression "ap{2}".
   007
{
    "$or":[
        {"$exists":"tags.v"},
        {"$typeof":{"tags":"string"}}
    ]
}

   Matches documents where either tags is a nested document with a
   subfield v, or tags is a scalar string.
   002, 008
   Note: You can improve the performance of queries with conditions by
   using secondary indexes. See [1]Queries that Benefit from Secondary
   Indexes for more details.
