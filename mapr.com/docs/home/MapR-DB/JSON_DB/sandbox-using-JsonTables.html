Sandbox Tutorial for JSON

   This section provides a tutorial that will help you build a Java
   application using the MapR Database JSON Java API library.

   This tutorial is an implementation of the [1]Open JSON Application
   Interface (OJAI) API library. Basic information about using the [2]MapR
   Database Shell (JSON Tables) utility for JSON tables is also included
   in this document.

About OJAI

   The MapR Database JSON Java API library leverages MapR Database support
   for OJAI in many areas, including:
     * Tables
     * Sub-documents
     * Efficient access to data
     * Large document support
     * Security

   Key features of the API library include:
     * APIs for manipulating JSON documents
     * Extensions to the Hadoop ecosystem:
          + Efficient parsing of large files
          + MapReduce integration

JSON Support

   MapR Database, in addition to its support of the key-value model
   (column family), now offers a Document Model. This means that
   applications can use a JSON document to represent data. JSON is built
   on two structures:
     * A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is
       realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table,
       keyed list, or associative array.
     * An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as
       an array, vector, list, or sequence.

   A document looks like this:
{
    "_id" : "001",
    "first_name" : "John",
    "last_name" : "Doe",
    "age" : 45,
    "email" : "jd@mydoc.com",
    "interests" : ["sports", "movies"],
    "address" : {
        "street" : "1015 Main Street",
        "city" : "San Jose",
        "state" : "CA",
        "zip" : "95106"
    }
}

   MapR Database stores the documents in tables. An interesting aspect of
   MapR Database JSON is that inside a table, documents can have a
   different structure.

   Documents inside MapR Database must have a unique identifier stored in
   the _id field.

   MapR Database does not store the documents as a whole in a single
   location. Instead, MapR Database creates fields for each attribute and
   nested documents/attributes. This allows MapR Database to access the
   information very efficiently. When you read, for example using
   projection, or when you edit a document, only the necessary fields will
   be modified. MapR Database can store very large documents, for example,
   multi-GB documents, if the application requires it.
