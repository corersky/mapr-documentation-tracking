Obtaining readperm and writeperm on Fields

   In this scenario, you want to perform an operation on a field, and the
   operation requires that you have readperm and writeperm permissions on
   that field. How you obtain these permissions depends on whether the
   field is in the default column family or a non-default column family.

When the field is in the default column family

   In the document below, you want to perform an operation on field c,
   which is in the default column family. The operation requires you to
   have readperm and writeperm on field c.

   in the default column family

   Case 1: You have readperm and writeperm on the default column family
          In this case, field c inherits these permissions, assuming that
          the permissions were not denied on field a or b.

          If you do not have readperm and writeperm on field a or b, you
          need traverseperm on the field that denied you those
          permissions. You also need readperm and writeperm explicitly
          granted to you on field c. You could be granted these
          permissions with the maprcli table cf colperm set command, as in
          these examples:

maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table>
-cfname default -name a.b -traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this fie
ld>
maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table> -cfname default
-name a.b.c -readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field> -writeperm
u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>

   Case 2: You do not have readperm and writeperm on the default column
          family
          In this case, you need the traverseperm permission on the
          default column family. Fields a and b inherit this permission.
          You also need readperm and writeperm on field c.

          You could be granted these permissions with commands similar to
          these:

maprcli table cf edit -path <path to JSON table> -cfname default -traverseperm
u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table> -cfname default -name a.
b.c
-readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field> -writeperm u:<user ID> |
<existing ACE for this field>

When the field is in a non-default column family

   Note: Non-default column families are an advanced feature of MapR
   Database's native JSON support. For information about them, see
   [1]Column Families in JSON table.

   In the document below, you want to perform an operation on field c,
   which is in the column family cf1 that is defined at field b with the
   path a.b.

   are in a column family that has the path a.b

   Case 1: You do not have readperm and writeperm on field b
          You need traverseperm on field b and both readperm and writeperm
          on field c. You can be granted these permissions with commands
          similar to these:

maprcli table cf edit -path <path to JSON table> -cfname cf1
-traverseperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field>
maprcli table cf colperm set -path <path to JSON table> -cfname cf1 -name a.b.c
-readperm u:<user ID> | <existing ACE for this field> -writeperm u:<user ID> |
<existing ACE for this field>

   Case 2: You do have readperm and writeperm on field b
          You do not need any further permissions. Field c inherits your
          readperm and writeperm permissions from field b.
