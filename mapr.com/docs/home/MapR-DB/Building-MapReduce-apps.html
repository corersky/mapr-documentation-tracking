Building MapReduce Applications

   This section provides information about building and running custom
   MapReduce application that access MapR Database binary tables.

   The steps for building and running custom MapReduce applications that
   run against MapR Database are the same as the steps for building and
   running custom MapReduce applications that run against Apache HBase.
   The steps are documented in the Apache HBase Reference Guide at
   [1]http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#mapreduce.

   However, you must use an HBase JAR file from MapR's Maven repository at
   [2]http://repository.mapr.com/nexus/content/groups/mapr-public/org/apac
   he/hbase/hbase-server/. The name of the JAR file that you use must
   contain the version of HBase and the version of MapR that you are
   using.

   For example, if you are using HBase 1.1 and MapR version 5.1, you would
   use the file hbase-server-1.1.1-mapr-1602.jar.
