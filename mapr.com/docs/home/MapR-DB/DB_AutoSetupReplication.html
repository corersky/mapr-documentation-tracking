Replica Autosetup for MapR Database Tables

   The option to automatically set up table replication, also known as
   replica autosetup, performs the steps to set up and start the
   replication of MapR Database binary table and MapR Database JSON
   tables. The replica autosetup option is available through the MCS and
   maprcli.

   In general, replica autosetup performs the following steps to set up
   replication:
    1. Creates a new table with metadata from the source table in the
       destination cluster.
    2. Declares the new table to be a replica of the source table and sets
       a paused replication state to ensure that replication does not
       begin immediately after the next step.
    3. Declares the source table as an upstream source for the replica.
    4. Loads a copy of the source data into the replica.
    5. For multi-master replication, replica autosetup declares the source
       table to be a replica of the new table and then declares the new
       table to be an upstream source for the source table.
    6. Clears the paused replication state to start the replication
       stream.

   By default, replica autosetup uses the directcopy option. However,
   based on how you run replica autosetup, you also have the choice not to
   use directcopy.

Replica Autosetup with Directcopy (default)

   The directcopy option uses gateways to perform all setup operations
   including the initial population of data into the replica table.
   Directcopy is the default option when you setup table replication using
   the MCS or with the maprcli table replica autosetup command.

   When a client submits a request to automatically setup table
   replication to the cluster, the source cluster acknowledges the request
   and begins to track the replica autosetup request from start to finish.

   If a failure occurs when replica autosetup operations are in progress,
   the source cluster resumes operations from the point of failure.
   Note: To check the replication status of a table, run the [1]maprcli
   table replica list command. To stop the automatic setup of table
   replication, run [2]maprcli table replica remove, or delete the source
   or replica table.
   Replica autosetup with directcopy provides the following benefits:
     * Replica autosetup operations do not block the client from
       submitting additional requests. When setting up table replication,
       the process to copy source data to the replica can be time
       consuming. The client does not need to wait for the replica
       autosetup request to complete before submitting another request.
     * Source cluster retries replica autosetup operations in case of
       failure. The source cluster keeps track of the replica autosetup
       progress. This allows the source cluster to resume autosetup
       operations in the event of an intermittent failure. If you choose
       to not use directcopy, user intervention is required if a failure
       occurs.
     * Throttling of copy table operations is done by default. Throttling
       prevents the initial copy of data from the source to the replica
       table from consuming all cluster resources.

Replica Autosetup without Directcopy (not default)

   Without the directcopy option, replica autosetup submits a majority of
   the replication setup requests through the client and then runs a copy
   table utility to populate the initial table data. To use replica
   autosetup without the directcopy option, run maprcli table replica
   autosetup command with the -directcopy parameter set to false.

   Without the directcopy option, once a client submits an replica
   autosetup request to the cluster, it must wait until the source cluster
   sends a notification that the autosetup request is complete before it
   can submit another request to the cluster. In this case, replica
   autosetup uses the client connection to submit autosetup operation
   requests such as create replica, add replica, and add upstream source.
   Then, to populate the initial table data, it runs mapr copytable for
   JSON tables and the CopyTable utility for binary tables.

   If a failure occurs when replica autosetup operations are in progress,
   the client hangs and any replica tables that were created during the
   failed autosetup operations must be manually deleted before you can try
   to setup replication again.
