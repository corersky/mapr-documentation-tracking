High Availability

   Due to the architecture of how updates to table regions (also called
   tablets) are applied and and replicated, data in table regions are
   instantly available. Tables and table regions are part of abstract
   entities called containers which provide the automatic replication of
   table regions (with a default of three) across the nodes of a cluster.

   Containers are replicated to a configurable number of copies, which are
   distributed to different nodes in the same cluster as the original or
   master container. A cluster's CLDB determines the order in which the
   replicas are updated. Together, the replicas form a replication chain
   that is updated transactionally. When an update is applied to a region
   (also called tablets) in the master container (which is at the head of
   a replication chain), the update is applied serially to the replicas of
   that container in the chain. The update is complete only when all
   replicas in the chain are updated.

   The result of this architecture is that when a node goes down due to
   hardware failure, the regions served by that node are available
   instantly from one of the other nodes that have the replicated data.

   MapR can detect the exact point at which replicas diverge, even at a 2
   GB per second update rate. MapR randomly picks any one of the three
   copies as the new master, rolls back the other surviving replicas to
   the divergence point, and then rolls forward to converge with the
   chosen master. MapR can do this on the fly with very little impact on
   normal operations.
   Note: The automatic replication factor is set at the volume level since
   containers are contained in volumes.
