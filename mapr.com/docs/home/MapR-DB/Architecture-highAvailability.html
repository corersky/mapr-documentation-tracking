High Availability

   Because of the way updates to table regions (also called tablets) are
   applied and replicated, data in table regions are instantly available.
   Tables and table regions are part of abstract entities called
   containers that provide the automatic replication of table regions
   (with a default of three) across the nodes of a cluster.

   Containers are replicated to a configurable number of copies. These
   copies are distributed to different nodes in the same cluster as the
   original or master container. The cluster CLDB determines the order in
   which the replicas are updated. Together, the replicas form a
   replication chain that is updated transactionally. When an update is
   applied to a region (also called tablets) in the master container
   (which is at the head of a replication chain), the update is applied
   serially to the replicas of that container in the chain. The update is
   complete only when all replicas in the chain are updated.

   Because of this architecture, when a hardware failure brings down a
   node, the regions served by that node are available instantly from one
   of the other nodes that have the replicated data.

   MapR software can detect the exact point at which replicas diverge,
   even at a 2-GB-per-second update rate. The software randomly picks any
   one of the three copies as the new master, rolls back the other
   surviving replicas to the divergence point, and then rolls forward to
   converge with the chosen master. MapR software can do this on the fly
   with very little impact on normal operations.
   Note: Since containers are contained in volumes, the automatic
   replication factor is set at the volume level.
