Setting Up Table Replication Using the CLI

   You can run the maprcli table replica autosetup command to set up
   master-slave or multi-master replication from an existing source table.
   Note: This procedure describes how to use the maprcli to automatically
   setup table replication. As an alternative, you can use the [1]MapR
   Control Service (MCS) to automatically setup table replication or use
   the maprcli to [2]manually setup master-slave replication or
   [3]manually setup multi-master replication.

   Complete the following steps before you begin:
     * Verify that you have complete the steps to configure the clusters
       for table replication. For more information, see [4]Preparing
       Clusters for Table Replication.
     * Run the maprcli table info command on the source table to verify
       that you have the following permissions:
          + readperm, which is required for reading from the table.
          + replperm, which is required for replicating from the table.
     * Run the maprcli table info command on the destination table (if it
       already exists) to verify that you have the following permissions:
          + bulkload, which is required for the initial copy of source
            data into the destination table.
          + replperm, which is required for receiving replicated updates
            from the source table.

   Note: All updates from a source table arrive at a replica after having
   been authenticated at a gateway. Therefore, access control expressions
   on the replica that control permissions for updates to column families
   and columns are irrelevant; gateways have the implicit authority to
   update replicas.
   Note: If you are setting up a master-slave replication loop for n
   clusters, repeat these steps for n-1 master-slave relationships to set
   up basic master-slave topologies.
    1. Log into both the source and destination clusters.
    2. Run the maprcli table replica autosetup command.
          + For master-slave replication:
maprcli table replica autosetup -path <path to source table> -replica <path to r
eplica>
          + For multi-master replication:
maprcli table replica autosetup -path <path to source table> -replica <path to r
eplica> -multimaster true
            Note:
            The parameter -multimaster is an optional parameter that you
            use to set up multi-master replication.
       For example, to set up multi-master replication between the
       customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster and a new customers
       table in the newyork cluster, you could use this command:
maprcli table replica autosetup -path /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers -replica /map
r/newyork/customers -multimaster true
       To set up master-slave replication between the customersA table in
       the sanfrancisco cluster and a new customersB table in the same
       cluster, you could use this command:
maprcli table replica autosetup -path /mapr/sanfrancisco/customersA -replica /ma
pr/sanfrancisco/customersB
       Note: For information about additional parameters that you can
       configure, see [5]table replica autosetup.
    3. To check the replication status, run [6]table replica list.

   Additional Information:
     * With multi-master replication, if one of the tables goes offline,
       direct client applications to the other table. For more
       information, see [7]Multi-Master replication.
     * Be aware that changes to the structure of a source table are not
       replicated automatically to replicas. For more information, see
       [8]Adding a Column Family to a Replica
     * You can check for alarms related to replication and whether
       synchronous replication is switched temporarily to asynchronous
       replication by looking in MCS. See [9]Table-Replication Alarms.
