Create a table

   The sample application creates a table by calling a function named
   ensureTable.

APIs used

   The definition of this function uses these APIs:
   APIs defined in the header file admin.h.
     * hb_admin_table_create(): Creates a table. Returns 0 on success or
       an error code.
     * hb_admin_table_delete(): Deletes a table. Returns 0 on success or
       an error code.
     * hb_admin_destroy(): Disconnects the hb_admin object, releasing any
       internal objects or connections that were created in the
       background.
     * hb_admin_table_disable(): Disables an HBase table. Returns 0 on
       success or an error code. Only sets a flag in memory to say that
       the table is disabled.
       Note: Tables never need to be disabled or enabled in MapR Database,
       which has no notion of disabling or enabling tables. However,
       applications ported from HBase to MapR Database will attempt to
       disable and enable tables. By placing a flag in memory, MapR
       Database allows those applications to proceed without error when
       performing admin functions on tables.
     * hb_admin_table_enable(): Enables an HBase table. Returns 0 on
       success or an error code. As with hb_admin_table_enable, this
       function sets a flag in memory and performs no other operation.
     * hb_admin_table_enabled(): Checks whether an HBase table is enabled.
       Returns 0 if the table is enabled. If the table is disabled,
       returns either the error message HBASE_TABLE_DISABLED or an error
       code, if an error occurs. In MapR Database, this API only checks
       for the existence of an in-memory flag that indicates whether to
       consider a table as disabled or enabled.
     * hb_admin_table_exists(): Checks whether a table exists. Returns 0
       on success or an error code.

   APIs defined in the header file coldesc.h.
     * hb_coldesc_create(): Creates a column-family descriptor. Returns a
       handle to an hb_columndesc object or NULL, if unsuccessful.
     * hb_coldesc_set_maxversions(): Sets the maximum number of cell
       versions to be retained for the column family. The default is 3.
     * hb_coldesc_set_minversions(): Sets the minimum number of cell
       versions to be retained for the column family. The default is 0.
     * hb_coldesc_set_ttl(): Sets the time-to-live value in seconds for
       data in column cells. The default is forever.
     * hb_coldesc_set_inmemory(): Boolean. Determines whether preference
       is given to values of this column family for storage with row keys.
       Because row keys are cached in memory in preference to row data,
       column-family data that is stored inline with the row keys is also
       cached in memory.
       For all column families in a table together, up to 200 bytes of row
       data will be stored inline with each row key. Storing data inline
       with a row key might speed retrieval of the data from a column
       family because disk access can often be avoided. For each column
       family, up to 32 bytes can be stored inline with each row key even
       if its inmemory parameter is set to false, but preference will be
       given to column families where this parameter is set to true. A
       column family can have more than 32 bytes stored inline if its
       inmemory parameter is set to true.
       If the total number of bytes for all column families together
       exceeds 200 for a row, then preference for inclusion within the
       inline storage for that row is given to column families that have
       the inmemory parameter set to true. All of the data for a column
       family will be stored in-line with the row key, or none will be. If
       the contents in a column family for a particular row are larger
       than the maximum number of bytes that are allowed to be stored for
       that column family, no data at all will be stored in-line for that
       column family.
       The default value for the inmemory parameter is false.
     * hb_coldesc_destroy(): Releases resources that are held by a
       column-family descriptor.

Sequence of steps in the ensureTable function

    1. Create an admin handle from the connection.
    2. Using the admin handle, check whether the specified table exists.
    3. If the table exists, delete it.
    4. Specify columns and column families for the table.
    5. Create the table.
    6. Check whether the table is enabled. If it isnâ€™t enabled, enable it.
    7. Disable the table and then enable it again.
    8. Destroy the column descriptors.
    9. Destroy the hb_admin structure.
