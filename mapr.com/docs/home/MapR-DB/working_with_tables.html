Managing Tables

   MapR Database supports two types of table: binary tables and JSON
   tables. This section covers how to create, edit, and delete tables, as
   well as how to set parameter values, display parameter values, grant
   permissions and access, replicate tables, and more using the MapR
   Control System and the CLI.
   When you log in to the MapR Control System and click Data > Table, the
   Tables page displays the following in the various panes:
     * [1]Active Alarms — The active table (replication) alarms
     * Recently Viewed Tables — The tables that were most recently
       accessed from MCS
     * List of volumes that you have access to and a search field to
       retrieve a table by table path

   Click Create Table button to create a new binary or JSON table. For a
   conceptual overview of:
     * Binary tables, see [2]MapR Database Binary Tables.
     * JSON tables, which contain JSON documents, see [3]MapR Database
       JSON Tables.
