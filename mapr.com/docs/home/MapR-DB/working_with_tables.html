Managing Tables

   MapR-DB supports two types of table: binary tables and JSON tables.
   This section covers how to create, edit, and delete tables, as well as
   how to set parameter values, display parameter values, grant
   permissions and access, replicate tables, and more using the MapR
   Control System and the CLI.
   When you log in to the MapR Control System and click Data > Table, the
   Tables page displays the following in the various panes:
     * [1]Top Table Operations by Nodes — The nodes that had the most
       number of table operations (gets, puts, and scans)
     * [2]Active Alarms — The active table (replication) alarms
     * Recently Viewed Tables — The tables that were most recently
       accessed from MCS
     * List of volumes that you have access to and a search field to
       retrieve a table by table path

   Click Create Table button to create a new binary or JSON table. For a
   conceptual overview of:
     * Binary tables, see [3]MapR-DB Binary Tables.
     * JSON tables, which contain JSON documents, see [4]MapR-DB JSON
       Tables.
