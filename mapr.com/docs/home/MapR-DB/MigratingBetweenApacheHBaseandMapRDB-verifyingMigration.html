Verifying Migration

   After copying data to the new tables, verify that the migration is
   complete and successful. In increasing order of complexity:
    1. Verify that the destination table exists. From the HBase shell, use
       the list command, or use the ls /user/john/foo command from a Linux
       prompt:
hbase(main):006:0> list '/user/john/foo'
TABLE
/user/john/foo/mytable01
1 row(s) in 0.0770 seconds
    2. Check the number of rows in the source table against the
       destination table with the count command:
hbase(main):005:0> count '/user/john/foo/mytable01'
30 row(s) in 0.1240 seconds
    3. Hash each table, then compare the hashes.
