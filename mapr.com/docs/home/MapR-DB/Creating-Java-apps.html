Creating Java Apps - Binary Tables

   This topics describes the supported Apache HBase Java APIs used for
   CRUD operations on MapR Database binary tables.

   MapR Database supports all of the Apache HBase 1.0 Java APIs, except
   where noted in this documentation. For a number of critical Java APIs,
   for filters, and for comparators, this documentation explicitly lists
   what is supported, rather than what is not supported.

   Code written for Apache HBase can be easily ported to use MapR Database
   binary tables.

   MapR Database binary tables do not support low-level HBase API calls
   that are used to manipulate the state of an Apache HBase cluster. HBase
   API calls that are not supported by MapR Database tables report
   successful completion to allow legacy code written for Apache HBase to
   continue executing, but do not perform any actual operations.
   Note: For the list of supported HBase v0.98 APIs, refer to the [1]HBase
   Java API Support.
