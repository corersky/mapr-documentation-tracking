Mirroring and Replication

   Since MapR Database tables are created in volumes, mirroring of volumes
   lets you automatically replicate differential data in real-time across
   clusters. You might want mirror volumes to create disaster recovery
   solutions for databases or to provide read-only access to data from
   multiple locations.

   Because MapR Database does not require RegionServers to be
   reconstructed, databases can be brought up instantly on the mirrored
   site if the active site goes down.

   Mirroring is a parallel operation, copying data directly from the nodes
   of one MapR cluster to the nodes in a remote MapR cluster. The contents
   of the volume are mirrored consistently, even if the files in the
   volume are being written to or deleted.

   MapR captures only data that has changed at the file-block level since
   the last data transfer. After the data differential is identified, it
   is then compressed and transferred over the WAN to the recovery site,
   using very low network bandwidth. Finally, checksums are used to ensure
   data integrity across the two clusters. There is no performance penalty
   on the cluster because of mirroring.

   See [1]Mirror Volumes for more details.
