Snapshots

   Since MapR Database tables are created in volumes, you can use a volume
   snapshot to capture the state of a volume's directories, MapR Database
   tables, and files at an exact point in time.

   Volume snapshots for rollbacks, hot backups, model training, and
   real-time data analysis management.

   Rollback from errors
          Application errors or inadvertent user errors can mistakenly
          delete data or modify data in an unexpected way. With volume
          snapshots, you can rollback your MapR Database tables to a
          known, well-defined state.

   Hot backups
          You can create backups of table data on the fly for auditing or
          governance compliance.

   Model training
          Machine-learning frameworks can use snapshots to enable a
          reproducible and auditable model training process. Snapshots
          allow the training process to work against a preserved image of
          the training data from a precise moment in time. In most cases,
          the use of snapshots requires no additional storage and
          snapshots are taken in less than one second.

   Managing real-time data analysis
          By using snapshots, query engines such as Apache Drill can
          produce precise synchronic summaries of data sources subject to
          constant updates, such as sensor data or social media streams.
          Using a snapshot of your MapR Database data for such analyses
          allows very precise comparisons to be done across multiple
          ever-changing data sources without the need to stop real-time
          data ingestion.

          See [1]MapR Snapshots for more details.
