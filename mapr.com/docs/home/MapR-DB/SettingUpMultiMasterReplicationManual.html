Setting Up Multi-Master Replication Manually

   You can run maprcli commands to set up multi-master replication, first
   establishing replication in one direction, and then establishing it in
   the other direction.
     * Verify that you have complete the steps to configure the clusters
       for table replication. For more information, see [1]Preparing
       Clusters for Table Replication.
     * Run the maprcli table info command on the source table to verify
       that you have the following permissions:
          + readperm, which is required for reading from the table.
          + replperm, which is required for replicating from the table.
     * Run the maprcli table info command on the destination table (if it
       already exists) to verify that you have the following permissions:
          + bulkload, which is required for the initial copy of source
            data into the destination table.
          + replperm, which is required for receiving replicated updates
            from the source table.

    1. For manual setup in one direction, follow these steps:
         a. Create the replica manually with the maprcli table create
            command. Use the -copymetafrom option to ensure that the
            metadata for the replica is identical to the metadata for the
            source table. Metadata includes column families, access
            control expressions (ACEs), and other attributes.
maprcli table create -path <path to the replica> -copymetafrom <path to the sour
ce table>
            For example, to create the replica customers in the newyork
            cluster and use the metadata from the source table in the
            sanfrancisco cluster, you could use this command:
maprcli table create -path /mapr/newyork/customers -copymetafrom /mapr/sanfranci
sco/customers
         b. Register the replica as a replica of the source table by
            running the maprcli table replica add command.
maprcli table replica add -path <path to the source table> -replica <path to the
 replica> -paused true
            For example, to register the customers table in the newyork
            cluster as a replica of the customers table in the
            sanfrancisco cluster, you could use this command:
maprcli table replica add -path /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers -replica /mapr/newy
ork/customers -paused true
            The -paused parameter ensures that replication does not start
            immediately after you register the source table as a source
            for this replica. You do this registration in step d.
         c. Verify that you specified the correct replica by running the
            maprcli table replica list command.
maprcli table replica list -path <path to the source table>
            To verify that the customers table in the newyork cluster is a
            replica of the customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster,
            you could look at the output of this command:
maprcli table replica list -path /mapr/sanfrancisco/customers
         d. Authorize replication between the tables by registering the
            source table as the upstream table for the replica by running
            the maprcli table upstream add command. Definition of the
            upstream table ensures that a table cannot replicate updates
            to any replica. Replication depends on a two-way agreement
            between the owners of the two tables.
maprcli table upstream add -path <path to the replica> -upstream <path to the so
urce table>
            To add the customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster as an
            upstream source for the customers table in the newyork
            cluster:
maprcli table upstream add -path /mapr/newyork/customers -upstream /mapr/sanfran
cisco/customers
         e. Verify that you specified the correct source table by running
            the maprcli table upstream list command.
maprcli table upstream list -path <path to the replica>
            To verify this in our example scenario, you could use this
            command:
maprcli table upstream list -path /mapr/newyork/customers
         f. If you set -paused to true when adding the replica, follow
            these steps:
              i. Load the replica with data from the source table by using
                 the MapR Database [2]CopyTable utility for binary tables
                 or the [3]MapR Database JSON CopyTable utility for JSON
                 tables.
             ii. Start replication with the command maprcli table replica
                 resume. Here is the maprcli command:
maprcli table replica resume -path <path to the source table> -replica <path to
the replica>
                 For our example scenario, you could use this command:
maprcli table replica resume -path mapr/sanfrancisco/customers -replica /mapr/ne
wyork/customers
    2. For manual setup in the other direction, follow these steps:
         a. Log into both the source and destination clusters.
         b. Register the replica as a replica of the source table by
            running the maprcli table replica add command.
maprcli table replica add -path <path to the source table> -replica <path to the
 replica>
         c. Verify that you specified the correct replica by running the
            maprcli table replica list command.
maprcli table replica list -path <path to the source table>
         d. Authorize replication between the tables by defining the
            source table as the upstream table for the replica by running
            the maprcli table upstream add command. Definition of the
            upstream table ensures that a table cannot replicate updates
            to any replica. Replication depends on a two-way agreement
            between the owners of the two tables.
maprcli table upstream add -path <path to the replica> -upstream <path to the so
urce table>

     * With multi-master replication, if one of the tables goes offline,
       direct client applications to the other table. For more
       information, see [4]Multi-Master replication.
     * Be aware that changes to the structure of a source table are not
       replicated automatically to replicas. For more information, see
       [5]Adding a Column Family to a Replica
     * You can check for alarms related to replication and whether
       synchronous replication is switched temporarily to asynchronous
       replication by looking in MCS. See [6]Table-Replication Alarms.
