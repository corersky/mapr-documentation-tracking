MapR Database Sample C Application

   MapR provides a sample C application that accesses and performs
   operations on MapR Database binary tables. This section describes the
   various operation performed by the application.

   The sample C application is located in the /opt/mapr/examples/sample
   directory.

Prerequisites

   In order to compile and run the sample application, install the
   mapr-client package on the node where you will build the application.
   See [1]Impersonation Example. If the mapr-core package is already
   installed, you do not need to install the mapr-client package.

Compiling

   To compile and run the sample application, read the instructions in the
   README file in the /opt/mapr/examples/sample directory.
