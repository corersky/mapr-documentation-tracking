Administering Tables

   Administration of the MapR Database is done primarily via the command
   line (maprcli) or with the MapR Control System (MCS). Regardless of
   whether the MapR Database table is used for binary files or JSON
   documents, the same types of commands are used with slightly different
   parameter options. MapR Database administration is associated with
   tables, columns and column families, and table regions.

Why use MapR Database?

   From an administrator's point-of-view, MapR Database provides the
   following capabilities:
     * Minimal administration: Single namespace for files, tables and
       streams, flexible schema that allows built-in data management and
       protection, automatic splits and merges as data grows and shrinks,
       and easy bulk data loading.
     * Self-healing from HW and SW failures: Replicated state and data for
       instant recovery and automated re-replication of data.
     * Global low-latency replication: Multi-master (that is, active to
       active) replication which is important for disaster recovery.
       Includes reduced risk of data loss, application failover, and
       faster data access.
     * High performance and low latency: Integrated system with fewer
       software layers, single hop to data, and no compactions with low
       I/O amplification.
     * Fine-grained security: Access permissions can be granted to tables
       (as well as files and streams) at a granular level using [1]MapR
       Access Control Expressions (ACEs), which are designed for
       flexibility and ease-of-use.

Useful Administrator Resources

   Links to Resources Descriptions

   [3]maprcli and REST API Syntax
   Command line reference for MapR operations. For MapR Database, the
   commands particularly applicable are assocociate with the maprcli
   [4]table command. These commands include not only table CRUD operations
   but also table column family, table region, and table replication
   operations.
   [5]Utilities for MapR Database JSON Tables Utilities for MapR Database
   JSON tables. These utilities are used form managing JSON tables
   icluding importing and exporting data to and from JSON tables.
   Particularly useful are:
     * [6]MapR Database JSON ImportJSON utility with imports JSON
       documents into a MapR Database JSON table.
     * [7]MapR Database Shell (JSON Tables)utility which performs CRUD
       operations on JSON documents and tables.

   [8]Utilities for MapR Database Binary Tables Utilities for MapR
   Database binary tables. These utitlies are used for managing binary
   tables. Particulary useful is [9]MapR Database Binary CopyTable which
   is used to copy data from one MapR Database binary table to another.
   Note: To import HFile or Result files in a MapR Database binary table,
   the hbase command can be used. See [10]Loading Data into Binary Tables.
   [11]Configuring Security Information on security tasks for configuring
   MapR security, managing secure clusters, and administering auditing.
   [12]Hadoop and Big Data Security MapR information on Security and Big
   Data Governance that identified key unique advantages including
   authentication, authorization, auditing, and encryption.
   [13]Provisioning Secure Access Controls in MapR Database MapR blog
   discussing MapR's boolean Access Control Expressions (ACEs) which
   provide granular-level permissions including topics and examples of
   best practices.
