Column Families in Binary Tables

   Scanning an entire table for matches can be very performance-intensive.
   Column families enable you to group related sets of data and restrict
   queries to a defined subset, leading to better performance. When you
   design a column family, think about what kinds of queries are going to
   be used the most often, and group your columns accordingly.

   You can specify compression settings for individual column families,
   which lets you choose the settings that prioritize speed of access or
   efficient use of disk space, according to your needs.

   Be aware of the approximate number of rows in your column families.
   This property is called the column family's cardinality. When column
   families in the same table have very disparate cardinalities, the
   sparser table's data can be spread out across multiple nodes, due to
   the denser table requiring more splits. Scans on the sparser column
   family can take longer due to this effect. For example, consider a
   table that lists products across a small range of model numbers, but
   with a row for the unique serial numbers for each individual product
   manufactured within a given model. Such a table will have a very large
   difference in cardinality between a column family that relates to the
   model number compared to a column family that relates to the serial
   number. Scans on the model-number column family will have to range
   across the cluster, since the frequent splits required by the
   comparatively large numbers of serial-number rows will spread the
   model-number rows out across many regions on many nodes.

   For a list of the properties that you can set when you create a column
   family, see the documentation for the maprcli command [1]table cf
   create .
   Note: When replicating a specific column family or column from a binary
   source table and a row is deleted, the destination table will show only
   a deletion for the specific column family or column. When replicating a
   specific column from a binary source table and its column family is
   deleted, the destination table will show only a deletion for the
   specific column.

Column Design

   MapR-DB tables split at the row level, not the column level. For this
   reason, extremely wide tables with very large numbers of columns can
   sometimes reach the recommended size for a table split at a
   comparatively small number of rows.
   Warning: In general, design your schema to prioritize more rows and
   fewer columns.

   Because MapR-DB tables are sparse, you can add columns to a table at
   any time. Null columns for a given row don't take up any storage space.
