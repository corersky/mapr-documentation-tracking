HBase Java Filters Support

   The hb_get_set_filter() and hb_scanner_set_filter() C APIs are used to
   filter the results of GET and SCAN operations. These APIs are in the
   get.h and scanner.h header files.

   They both take filters that are passed as strings, as well as the
   length of these strings. MapR Database parses the strings to construct
   filters.

   Their signatures are:
int32_t hb_get_set_filter(hb_get_t get, const byte_t *filter, const int32_t filt
erLen);
int32_t hb_scanner_set_filter(hb_scanner_t scanner, const byte_t *filter, const
int32_t filterLen);

   For examples, see [1]Filtering GET Operation Results Example and
   [2]Filtering SCAN Operation Results Example.
