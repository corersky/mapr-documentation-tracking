Supported Filters

   Filter Format Description
   ColumnCountGetFilter ColumnCountGetFilter(x) Returns the first x
   columns in a row. Used for GET operations.
   ColumnPaginationFilter ColumnPaginationFilter(x,y) Returns the first x
   columns after the number y of columns that is specified for the offset.
   ColumnPrefixFilter ColumnPrefixFilter('prefix') Returns only those
   key-values in columns that have names that start with the specified
   prefix. The column prefix must be of the form “qualifier”.
   ColumnRangeFilter
   ColumnRangFilter('minColumn','maxColumn',boolean,boolean)

   Returns only those key-values that are in columns that have names
   between minColumn and maxColumn.

   For example, if minColumn is 'an', and maxColumn is 'be', the filter
   returns key-values from columns named 'ana', 'bad', but not from
   columns named 'bed' or'eye' If minColumn is null, there is no lower
   bound. If maxColumn is null, there is no upper bound.

   This filter also takes two boolean variables to indicate whether to
   include the minColumn and maxColumn.
   DependentColumnFilter DependentColumnFilter('family','qualifier') Tries
   to locate the specified column in each row and returns all key-values
   that have the same timestamp in that column. If a row does not contain
   the specified column, none of the key-values in that row are returned.
   FamilyFilter FamilyFilter(compareOperator,'comparator:value') Filters
   by column family. If the comparison returns true, the filter returns
   all of the key-values in the matching column family.
   FirstKeyOnlyFilter FirstKeyOnlyFilter() Returns the first key-value
   from each row.
   FirstKeyValueMatchingQualifiersFilter
   FirstKeyValueMatchingQualifier('qualifier_1',
   'qualifier_2',...'qualifier_n') Serially compares each qualifier in a
   row with the given qualifiers. If the current qualifier matches any of
   the given qualifiers, the filter stops and includes the current row (up
   to the current qualifier) in the result set.
   FuzzyRowFilter FuzzyRowFilter('rowkey','fuzzy_info')

   Filters data based on fuzzy row key. Performs fast-forwards during
   scanning. It takes pairs (row key, fuzzy info) to match row keys. Where
   fuzzy info is a byte array with 0 or 1 as its values:

   0 - means that this byte in provided row key is fixed, i.e. row key's
   byte at same position must match

   1 - means that this byte in provided row key is NOT fixed, i.e. row
   key's byte at this position can be different from the one in provided
   row key

   Example: Let's assume row key format is userId_actionId_year_month.
   Length of userId is fixed and is 4, length of actionId is 2 and year
   and month are 4 and 2 bytes long respectively. Let's assume that we
   need to fetch all users that performed certain action (encoded as "99")
   in Jan of any year. Then the pair (row key, fuzzy info) would be the
   following: row key = "????_99_????_01" (one can use any value instead
   of "?") fuzzy info =
   "\x01\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00" I.e.
   fuzzy info tells the matching mask is "????_99_????_01", where at ? can
   be any value.
   InclusiveStopFilter InclusiveStopFilter('rowKey') Returns all
   key-values that are in the rows up to and including the specified row
   that has the specified row key.
   KeyOnlyFilter KeyOnlyFilter() Returns the key component of each
   key-value.
   MultipleColumnPrefixFilter

   MultipleColumnPrefixFilter('prefix_1','prefix_2', ...,'prefix_n')
   Returns the key-values from columns that have names that begin with any
   of the specified prefixes.
   PageFilter PageFilter(pageSize) Returns the number of rows that is
   equivalent to the specified page size..
   PrefixFilter PrefixFilter('rowKey_prefix') Returns the key-values from
   a row that has a key which starts with the specified row-key prefix.
   QualifierFilter QualifierFilter(compareOperator,'comparator:value')
   Filters by column. If the comparison returns true, the filter returns
   all of the key-values in the matching column.
   RandomRowFilter RandomRowFilter(probability) Filters by probability.
   For example, RandomRowFilter(0.25) means that there is a 1 in 4 chance
   that the filter will pick the first row, a 1 in 4 chance that the
   filter will pick the next row, and so on until all rows in the table
   have been processed in this way.
   RowFilter RowFilter(compareOperator,'comparator:value') Filters by row
   key. If the comparison returns true, the filter returns all of the
   key-values in the matching row.
   SingleColumnValueExcludeFilter
   SingleColumnValueExcludeFilter('columnFamily','qualifier',
   compareOperator,'comparator:value') This filter takes the same
   arguments and behaves the same as SingleColumnValueFilter: however, if
   the column is found and the condition passes, all of the columns of the
   row will be returned except for the tested column value.
   SingleColumnValueFilter
   SingleColumnValueFilter('columnFamily','qualifier',
   compareOperator,'comparator:value') This filter takes a column family,
   a qualifier, a compare operator and a comparator. If the specified
   column is not found: all of the columns of that row will be emitted. If
   the column is found and the comparison with the comparator returns
   true, all of the columns of the row will be emitted. If the condition
   fails, the row will not be returned.
   SkipFilter SKIP filter [1]See the description of the SKIP unary
   operator above .
   TimeStampsFilter TimeStampsFilter('timestamp_1','timestamp_2',...,
   'timestamp_n') Returns the key-values that have timestamps that match
   any of the specified timestamps.
   ValueFilter ValueFilter(compareOperator,'comparator:value') Filters by
   key-value. If the comparison returns true, the filter returns the
   matching key-value.
   WhileMatchFilter WHILE filter [2]See the description of the WHILE unary
   operator above .
