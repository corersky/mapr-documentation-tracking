Creating C Apps - Binary Tables

   MapR provides a library of C APIs – libMapRClient – for performing
   operations on MapR Database binary tables.

   The MapR Database libMapRClient C API library is MapR's extension of
   the libhbase C API library. The libMapRClient header files are in this
   directory: /opt/mapr/include/hbase

   libMapRClient uses the following conventions:
     * All data types are prefixed with 'hb_'.
     * All exported functions are annotated with HBASE_API, prefixed with
       'hb_' and named using the following convention:
       'hb_<subject>_<operation>_[<object>|<property>]'
     * All asynchronous APIs take a callback which is triggered when a
       request completes. This callback can be triggered in the caller's
       thread or in another thread. To avoid any potential deadlock or
       starvation, applications should not block in the callback routine.
     * All callbacks take a void pointer for application developers to
       supply their own data. This void pointer is passed when callback is
       triggered.

   Note: No explicit batching is supported for asynchronous APIs.

   CAPTION:

   Warning: It is the responsibility of applications to free up all
   backing data buffers. However, for asynchronous APIs, applications must
   wait before freeing buffers until after receiving callbacks or
   manipulating results. For better performance of asynchronous APIs,
   libMapRClient does not copy data buffers that are allocated for
   mutations, gets, and scans. These buffers hold table names, name space
   identifiers, row keys, column-family names, and column names or
   qualifiers. Instead, libMaprClient temporarily takes ownership of the
   buffers and references them with pointers until the callback is
   triggered. Therefore, applications should not free memory buffers
   before receiving callbacks for mutations. Applications also should not
   free memory buffers before receiving results for gets and scans. If
   applications must read results, the applications should not free memory
   buffers until the results are destroyed.

   CAPTION:

   Note: When one of these asynchronous APIs is invoked, a work item is
   created and queued for processing on the client:
     * hb_client_destroy()
     * hb_get_send()
     * hb_mutation_send()
     * hb_scanner_destroy()
     * hb_scanner_next()

   The work item is picked up as soon as possible by a thread in a thread
   pool.

   Client applications can often call these asynchronous APIs faster than
   the work items are processed. To ensure that the queue of work items
   does not grow without bound, the configuration parameter
   fs.mapr.pool.queue.max_size is set by default to 10,000. You can modify
   this parameter in the /opt/mapr/conf/dbclient.conf file for a client.

   Whenever the number of work items in the queue reaches this limit,
   libMapRClient returns the ENOBUFS error for each asynchronous call.
   Client applications are expected to handle this error, and can try the
   call again later.
