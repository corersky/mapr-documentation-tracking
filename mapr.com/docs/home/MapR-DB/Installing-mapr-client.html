Installing the mapr-client Package

   The mapr-client package must be installed on each node where you will
   be building and running your applications. This package installs all of
   the MapR Libraries needed for application development regardless of
   programming language or type of MapR Database table (binary or JSON).
   Note: The package mapr-core contains the files that are in the
   mapr-client package. If you have installed the mapr-core package, you
   do not need to install the mapr-client package.
   Complete the following steps to install the mapr-client package from a
   repository:
    1. Configure the repository to point to
       [1]https://package.mapr.com/releases/<release version>/<operating
       system>
       For example, if your VM has a CentOS operating system, edit the
       /etc/yum.repos.d/mapr_core.repo file and add the location.
    2. Based on your operating system, run one of the following commands
       to install the package:
          + On Red Hat /Centos: yum install mapr-client
          + On Ubuntu: apt-get install mapr-client
          + On SUSE: zypper install mapr-client
