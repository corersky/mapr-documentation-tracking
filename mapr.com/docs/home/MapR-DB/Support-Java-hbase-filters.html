Support for HBase Java Filters Support

   MapR Database supports the following Java filters, which work
   identically to their Apache HBase versions. See the [1]Apache HBase API
   for more information, specifically, the [2]Apache HBase Filter package.

   CAPTION:

   Filter

   Description
   ColumnCountGetFilter

   Simple filter that returns first N columns on row only. This filter was
   written to test filters in Get and as soon as it gets its quota of
   columns, filterAllRemaining() returns true. This makes this filter
   unsuitable as a Scan filter.
   ColumnPaginationFilter

   A filter, based on the ColumnCountGetFilter, takes two arguments: limit
   and offset. This filter can be used for row-based indexing, where
   references to other tables are stored across many columns, in order to
   efficient lookups and paginated results for end users. Only most recent
   versions are considered for pagination.
   ColumnPrefixFilter

   This filter is used for selecting only those keys with columns that
   matches a particular prefix. For example, if prefix is 'an', it will
   pass keys with columns like 'and', 'anti' but not keys with columns
   like 'ball', 'act'.
   ColumnRangeFilter

   This filter is used for selecting only those keys with columns that are
   between minColumn to maxColumn. For example, if minColumn is 'an', and
   maxColumn is 'be', it will pass keys with columns like 'ana', 'bad',
   but not keys with columns like 'bed', 'eye' If minColumn is null, there
   is no lower bound. If maxColumn is null, there is no upper bound.
   minColumnInclusive and maxColumnInclusive specify if the ranges are
   inclusive or not.
   DependentColumnFilter A filter for adding inter-column timestamp
   matching Only cells with a correspondingly timestamped entry in the
   target column will be retained Not compatible with Scan.setBatch as
   operations need full rows for correct filtering
   FamilyFilter This filter is used to filter based on the column family.
   It takes an operator (equal, greater, not equal, etc) and a byte []
   comparator for the column family portion of a key.

   This filter can be wrapped with WhileMatchFilter and SkipFilter to add
   more control. Multiple filters can be combined using FilterList . If an
   already known column family is looked for, use Get.addFamily(byte[])
   directly rather than a filter.
   FilterList Implementation of Filter that represents an ordered List of
   Filters which will be evaluated with a specified boolean operator
   FilterList.Operator.MUST_PASS_ALL (AND) or
   FilterList.Operator.MUST_PASS_ONE (OR). Since you can use Filter Lists
   as children of Filter Lists, you can create a hierarchy of filters to
   be evaluated. FilterList.Operator.MUST_PASS_ALL evaluates lazily:
   evaluation stops as soon as one filter does not include the KeyValue.
   FilterList.Operator.MUST_PASS_ONE evaluates non-lazily: all filters are
   always evaluated. Defaults to FilterList.Operator.MUST_PASS_ALL .
   FirstKeyOnlyFilter

   A filter that will only return the first KV from each row.

   This filter can be used to more efficiently perform row count
   operations.
   FirstKeyValueMatchingQualifiersFilter The filter looks for the given
   columns in KeyValue. Once there is a match for any one of the columns,
   it returns ReturnCode.NEXT_ROW for remaining KeyValues in the row.

   Note: It may emit KVs which do not have the given columns in them, if
   these KVs happen to occur before a KV which does have a match. Given
   this caveat, this filter is only useful for special cases like
   RowCounter .
   FuzzyRowFilter

   Filters data based on fuzzy row key. Performs fast-forwards during
   scanning. It takes pairs (row key, fuzzy info) to match row keys. Where
   fuzzy info is a byte array with 0 or 1 as its values:
     * 0 - means that this byte in provided row key is fixed, i.e. row
       key's byte at same position must match
     * 1 - means that this byte in provided row key is NOT fixed, i.e. row
       key's byte at this position can be different from the one in
       provided row key

   Example: Let's assume row key format is userId_actionId_year_month.
   Length of userId is fixed and is 4, length of actionId is 2 and year
   and month are 4 and 2 bytes long respectively. Let's assume that we
   need to fetch all users that performed certain action (encoded as "99")
   in Jan of any year. Then the pair (row key, fuzzy info) would be the
   following: row key = "????_99_????_01" (one can use any value instead
   of "?") fuzzy info =
   "\x01\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00" I.e.
   fuzzy info tells the matching mask is "????_99_????_01", where at ? can
   be any value.
   InclusiveStopFilter

   A Filter that stops after the given row. There is no "RowStopFilter"
   because the Scan spec allows you to specify a stop row. Use this filter
   to include the stop row, eg: [A,Z].
   KeyOnlyFilter

   A filter that will only return the key component of each KV (the value
   will be rewritten as empty).

   This filter can be used to grab all of the keys without having to also
   grab the values.
   MultipleColumnPrefixFilter

   This filter is used for selecting only those keys with columns that
   matches a particular prefix. For example, if prefix is 'an', it will
   pass keys will columns like 'and', 'anti' but not keys with columns
   like 'ball', 'act'.
   PageFilter

   Implementation of Filter interface that limits results to a specific
   page size. It terminates scanning once the number of filter-passed rows
   is > the given page size.

   Note that this filter cannot guarantee that the number of results
   returned to a client are <= page size. This is because the filter is
   applied separately on different region servers. It does however
   optimize the scan of individual HRegions by making sure that the page
   size is never exceeded locally.
   PrefixFilter

   Pass results that have same row prefix.
   QualifierFilter This filter is used to filter based on the column
   qualifier. It takes an operator (equal, greater, not equal, etc) and a
   byte [] comparator for the column qualifier portion of a key.

   This filter can be wrapped with WhileMatchFilter and SkipFilter to add
   more control. Multiple filters can be combined using FilterList . If an
   already known column qualifier is looked for, use Get.addColumn(byte[],
   byte[]) directly rather than a filter.
   RandomRowFilter

   A filter that includes rows based on a chance.
   RowFilter This filter is used to filter based on the key. It takes an
   operator (equal, greater, not equal, etc) and a byte [] comparator for
   the row, and column qualifier portions of a key.

   This filter can be wrapped with WhileMatchFilter to add more control.
   Multiple filters can be combined using FilterList. If an already known
   row range needs to be scanned, use CellScanner start and stop rows
   directly rather than a filter.
   SingleColumnValueExcludeFilter A Filter that checks a single column
   value, but does not emit the tested column. This will enable a
   performance boost over SingleColumnValueFilter , if the tested column
   value is not actually needed as input (besides for the filtering
   itself).
   SingleColumnValueFilter

   This filter is used to filter cells based on value. It takes a
   CompareFilter.CompareOp operator (equal, greater, not equal, etc), and
   either a byte [] value or a ByteArrayComparable.

   If we have a byte [] value then we just do a lexicographic compare. For
   example, if passed value is 'b' and cell has 'a' and the compare
   operator is LESS, then we will filter out this cell (return true). If
   this is not sufficient (eg you want to deserialize a long and then
   compare it to a fixed long value), then you can pass in your own
   comparator instead.

   You must also specify a family and qualifier. Only the value of this
   column will be tested. When using this filter on a CellScanner with
   specified inputs, the column to be tested should also be added as input
   (otherwise the filter will regard the column as missing).

   To prevent the entire row from being emitted if the column is not found
   on a row, use setFilterIfMissing(boolean) . Otherwise, if the column is
   found, the entire row will be emitted only if the value passes. If the
   value fails, the row will be filtered out.

   In order to test values of previous versions (timestamps), set
   setLatestVersionOnly(boolean) to false. The default is true, meaning
   that only the latest version's value is tested and all previous
   versions are ignored.

   To filter based on the value of all scanned columns, use ValueFilter.
   SkipFilter

   A wrapper filter that filters an entire row if any of the Cell checks
   do not pass.

   For example, if all columns in a row represent weights of different
   things, with the values being the actual weights, and we want to filter
   out the entire row if any of its weights are zero. In this case, we
   want to prevent rows from being emitted if a single key is filtered.
   Combine this filter with a ValueFilter:
 scan.setFilter(new SkipFilter(new ValueFilter(CompareOp.NOT_EQUAL, new BinaryCo
mparator(Bytes.toBytes(0))));

   Any row which contained a column whose value was 0 will be filtered out
   (since ValueFilter will not pass that Cell). Without this filter, the
   other non-zero valued columns in the row would still be emitted.
   TimestampsFilter

   Filter that returns only cells whose timestamp (version) is in the
   specified list of timestamps (versions).

   Note: Use of this filter overrides any time range/time stamp options
   specified using Get.setTimeRange(long, long), Scan.setTimeRange(long,
   long), or Scan.setTimeStamp(long). See the [3]Apache HBase API, Client
   package for detailed information.
   ValueFilter This filter is used to filter based on column value. It
   takes an operator (equal, greater, not equal, etc) and a byte []
   comparator for the cell value.

   This filter can be wrapped with WhileMatchFilter and SkipFilter to add
   more control. Multiple filters can be combined using FilterList. To
   test the value of a single qualifier when scanning multiple qualifiers,
   use SingleColumnValueFilter.
   WhileMatchFilter

   A wrapper filter that returns true from filterAllRemaining() as soon as
   the wrapped filters Filter.filterRowKey(byte[], int, int),
   Filter.filterKeyValue(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.Cell), Filter.filterRow()
   or Filter.filterAllRemaining() methods returns true.
