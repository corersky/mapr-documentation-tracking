Order of writes at replicas

   It is possible for replicated operations to arrive at and be written to
   a replica in an order different from the order they were written to a
   source table.

   In this diagram, the values “foo” and then “bar” are written to the
   source table. However, due to network issues, the values are written to
   the replica in the reverse order: “bar”, “foo”

   Client applications on the destination cluster should not depend on
   updates being written to the replica in the same order in which they
   were written to the source table.
