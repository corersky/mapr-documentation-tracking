Composite Indexes

   A composite index is an index that has more than one indexed field and
   zero or more included fields. Composite indexes enable you to optimize
   queries that filter and sort on multiple fields. If all fields
   referenced in a query are either indexed or included fields in a
   composite index, then you can process the query by reading only the
   index.

Sort Order

   MapR Database sorts the composite index in the order in which you have
   defined the indexed fields. For example, if you have an index on Field1
   and Field2, MapR Database sorts on Field1 as the primary sort key and
   Field2 as the secondary.

   Each component in a composite index can have its own ordering. For
   example, you can specify an ascending sort order for one field and a
   descending sort order for another.

Composite Indexes and Container Field Paths

   The indexed fields in a composite index can be [1]Container Field
   Paths. However, if you specify more than one container field path in
   your indexed fields, the prefixes of the container field paths must be
   the same. This allows MapR Database to store index values that
   originate from the same array element in a single index row.
   Examples of Supported Composite Indexes

   CAPTION:

   Indexed Fields Allowed for Composite Index Why Allowed?
   a[].b, x.z The indexed fields have only one container field path.
   a[].b, a[].c The indexed fields have a common container prefix, a[].
   a[].b, a[].c[] The indexed fields have a common container prefix, a[].
   a[].b[].c, a[].b[].d The indexed fields have a common container prefix,
   a[].b[].
   Examples of Unsupported Composite Indexes

   If a composite index includes the same subfield in multiple indexed
   fields, the implied types of the subfields must also be consistent. The
   third and fourth rows in the table below show examples of this
   restriction:

   CAPTION:

   Indexed Fields Disallowed for Composite Index Why Disallowed?
   a[].b, x[].y a[] and x[] are different container prefixes.
   a[].b[], a[].c[] Although both indexed fields have a common container
   prefix of a[], b[] and c[] are different container field paths.
   a.b[].c, a.b.d In the first indexed field, subfield b is an array of
   nested documents. In the second, b is a single nested document. This
   results in a type conflict.
   a, a[] The first indexed field a is a scalar type while the second is
   an array. This also results in a type conflict.
   Query Conditions Using Composite Indexes and Container Field Paths

   When you have a composite index defined on container field paths, your
   query condition must use the [2]elementAnd operator to use all keys of
   the index. With the and operator, the conditions do not have to match
   the same array element; as a result, the matching indexed field values
   might span different index rows, preventing use of the composite index.
   See [3]OJAI Query Conditions Using elementAnd for more details.

Composite Index Example

   Consider the following example, which illustrates the impact of key
   order in a composite index:
   [CompositeField.png]

   In the index on the left, the prefix key is Field1. MapR Database sorts
   the index first on Field1, and then on Field2. This aligns with the
   equality condition, Field1 = 3. MapR Database reads the least number of
   entries from the index on the left, due to this equality condition and
   the range condition on Field2.

   In the index on the right, MapR Database sorts the index on Field2,
   followed by Field1. In this case, the matching key values are not
   contiguous in the index, as highlighted by the entries in a lighter
   shade of yellow. MapR Database uses the filter conditions on Field2 to
   start the search in the index. It applies the filter condition on
   Field1 while reading the index. This is less efficient because MapR
   Database must read those extra nonmatching key values.
