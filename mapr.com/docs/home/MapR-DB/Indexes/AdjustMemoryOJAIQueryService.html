Adjusting Memory Settings in the OJAI Distributed Query Service

   This section describes how to verify, through log output, that your
   OJAI query is running out of memory due to memory limits in the OJAI
   Distributed Query Service. It then describes how to adjust the memory
   settings in the service.
    1. Before adjusting the OJAI Distributed Query Service memory
       settings, first confirm that your query has run out of memory due
       to limits in the service.
       You should see output like the following in your client application
       log:

       In the OJAI Distributed Query Service, log files are in the
       /opt/mapr/drill/<drill-version>/logs/drillbit.log on each node
       where the Query Service is running.
       You should see output like the following:

    2. After confirming, increase the Query Service memory settings by
       editing the /opt/mapr/conf/conf.d/warden.drill-bits.conf file on
       each Drillbit node. The file contains the following entries:
service.env=DRILL_HEAP=3072m,DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY=1024m,DRILLBIT_CODE_CACHE_S
IZE=512m
service.heapsize.min=4608
service.heapsize.max=4608
       Perform the following steps on each Drillbit node:
         a. Modify DRILL_HEAP and DRILL_MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY in the
            service.env entry based on your requirements.
         b. Update service.heapsize.min and service.heapsize.max to
            reflect the updates you made. The numbers sum to the 3 memory
            settings in the service.env entry.
         c. Restart warden on the node by running the following command:
service mapr-warden restart
