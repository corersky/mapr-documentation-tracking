Designing Secondary Indexes

   It is important that you create secondary indexes that provide the most
   benefit to your MapR Database JSON queries. This topic describes a
   general design approach that includes identifying query patterns, using
   common query patterns involving filters and ordering to determine which
   indexes to create, weighing the benefits of indexes against their
   update and storage costs, and taking into consideration index
   limitations.

   The following diagram summarizes the general approach to designing your
   indexes:

   Before designing your secondary indexes in relationship to your
   queries, make sure you understand the index feature, how to set up and
   use indexing, the commands used to perform tasks, and how to query the
   data through your application. The following cover these topics:
     * [2]Secondary Index Concepts
     * [3]Understanding the Secondary Index Workflow

Identify Query Patterns

   Query patterns, such as queries with filter conditions and ORDER BY
   clauses, indicate where indexes can improve performance. If a query
   does not contain selective filters, the overhead of using an index may
   cost more than a full table scan. You should also define your indexes
   so a single index benefits either multiple queries or individual
   queries that you run most often.

   See [4]Selection and Execution of Secondary Indexes to understand how
   MapR Database chooses which secondary indexes to use and how they
   improve performance.

Determine Potential Indexes Based on Query Patterns

   Based on your query patterns, the following table describes the types
   and characteristics of indexes you might want to create:
   Identified Query Pattern Potential Indexes to Create
   Compares individual fields with selective filter conditions

   Define single field indexes on the fields that you compare against.

   Verify that the fields contain supported data types.
   Filters against specific combinations of fields

   Define composite field indexes instead of single field indexes. Specify
   the sequence of the index keys so fields that appear in equality
   conditions are the prefixes in the keys.

   See [5]Using Multiple Indexes to Optimize Query Conditions for
   additional guidance on defining composite vs single field indexes.
   Accesses a subset of fields in a document, but does not filter or sort
   on these fields Add those fields as included fields in indexes.
   Filters on a subfield in a nested document Define the index key on the
   subfield.
   Filters on subfields in nested documents that are array elements Define
   the index key using a container field path: for example,
   arrayField[].subField.
   Filters and projects using a container field path

   Define the container field path as both an indexed field and included
   field.

   See [6]Covering Indexes and Container Field Paths for more details.
   Filters on individual elements of an array, which can appear in any
   position in the array Define an index using a container field path: for
   example, arrayField[].
   Issues Drill SQL queries with filter conditions that contain CAST
   expressions Specify the CAST function when defining the index key.
   Sorts on fields Define the sequence and order direction of the index
   keys to match the sequence and order direction of the fields your query
   sorts. If the sort order of the index keys matches the insertion order
   of documents, define hashed indexes.
   Sorts on one set of fields and filters on another set using equality
   conditions

   Define a composite index so that fields using equality conditions are
   the prefixes in the index keys, followed by the sort fields.

Evaluate Tradeoffs and Limitations

   Synchronizing Indexes

   When you design your indexes, remember that MapR Database must
   synchronize each index when you insert and update documents in the
   corresponding JSON table. This impacts the throughput performance of
   inserts and updates because MapR Database must perform additional
   writes. The impact increases with each additional index.

   MapR Database performs the synchronization operation asynchronously,
   which minimizes throughput overhead. The consequence is that an index
   may be inconsistent relative to its JSON table. If your application
   cannot tolerate lag time between the update to the JSON table and the
   update to the index, you should take that into consideration when
   deciding whether to index specific fields.

   See [7]Asynchronous Secondary Index Updates for more details about this
   feature.
   Index Storage Requirements

   Indexes increase your storage requirements. The storage size depends on
   the number of indexed and included fields in the index and the size of
   values stored in those fields. As the size of the index increases, the
   cost of reading the index also increases.

   Consider the storage costs when creating indexes and deciding on the
   fields to add to the index.
   Index Restrictions

   When designing your indexes, make sure MapR Database indexes support
   the functionality you need. For example, it may not be possible to
   create an index on a particular field path.

   See [8]Restrictions on Secondary Indexes for a complete list.
