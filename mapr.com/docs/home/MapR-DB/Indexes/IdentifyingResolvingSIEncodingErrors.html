Troubleshooting Secondary Index Encoding Errors

   This section describes how to locate secondary index encoding errors in
   log files, and then resolve them.
   Unresolved secondary index encoding errors can result in queries
   returning incomplete results. See [1]Secondary Index Encoding Error for
   details.

   To troubleshoot secondary index encoding errors, follow these steps:
    1. Determine whether any table has index encoding alarms by using one
       of the following two options:
          + Run the following grep command, searching for the strings
            index and encoding in the mfs.log-5 file:
# grep -i "index.*encoding" /opt/mapr/logs/mfs.log-5
2018-07-10 11:06:07,7042 INFO DB db/repl/araggregator.cc:524 Table 2050.43.26244
0 hit index row-key encoding error
2018-07-10 11:06:07,7042 INFO DB db/repl/araggregator.cc:914 Raising alarm VOLUM
E_ALARM_TABLE_INDEX_ENCODING_ERROR for volume 195503497
            The fid, 2050.43.262440, in the sample output indicates the
            table corresponding to the alarm. If you are not sure which
            table this corresponds to, you can convert the fid to a table
            path by following the instructions at [2]Converting fid and
            volid.
          + Check for any table index encoding alarms in the MapR Control
            System, as described at [3]Viewing Active Table Replication
            Alarms.
            The alarm details indicate the table corresponding to the
            alarm.
    2. Find the index on the table from step 1 that is causing the error.
       Run [4]dbshell indexscan with --mode set to err on each index to
       see the index's error output. You need to run the command multiple
       times if a table has multiple indexes with errors.
       For example, if table1 has three secondary indexes and all three
       secondary indexes have errors, you must run indexscan three times:
indexscan /table1 --indexname index1 --mode err
indexscan /table1 --indexname index2 --mode err
indexscan /table1 --indexname index3 --mode err
       The following example shows error output from running the dbshell
       indexscan command:
maprdb root:> indexscan /IndexEncodingErrorAlarmsTest1/tab1 --indexname idx1 --m
ode err
{"_id":"100","$ERROR":"Index field 1: INVALID_CAST"}
    3. Address the identified errors by attempting the following suggested
       resolutions:

   CAPTION:

   Error Suggested Resolutions
   KEY_TOO_LONG: The collective size of the index key is limited to less
   than 32 KB.
          + Reinsert the row in the JSON table so the collective size of
            all the indexed fields is less than 32 KB.
          + Redesign the secondary index so fields with large values are
            included fields instead of indexed fields.
          + Reduce the number of indexed fields in the secondary index.

   INVALID_CAST: An error was encountered applying the CAST function on an
   indexed field.
          + Verify that you have specified the correct types when using
            the CAST function with indexed fields.
          + If the types are correct, reinsert the row in the JSON table
            so the values of indexed fields can be cast to the specified
            type.
            See [5]Using Casts in Secondary Indexes.
