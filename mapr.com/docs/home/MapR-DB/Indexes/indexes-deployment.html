Understanding the Secondary Index Workflow

   Describes the overall workflow for using secondary indexes. This
   includes the roles of different users and the workflow steps involved.

   Before deploying secondary indexes, it is assumed that you have
   [1]installed and configured MapR Database and MapR-Drill to use
   secondary indexes, and have [2]created and [3]populated your MapR
   Database JSON tables. Implementing secondary indexes on JSON tables in
   MapR Database requires that you understand indexing concepts, know
   which administrative tasks to perform, and design your indexes to
   provide the most benefits for your queries.

   The following diagram depicts the workflow and identifies the roles and
   order of tasks. Each step contains a link to a section in this page
   with further details.

   The following is a brief summary of each step:
    1. Evaluate your queries to identify those that can benefit from
       indexes.
    2. Design your indexes by determining which fields need to be indexed.
    3. Create your indexes using either the MapR Control System or
       maprcli.
    4. Execute your queries.

How to Evaluate Queries that Benefit from Indexes

   MapR Database JSON supports indexes with various properties. Each
   property benefits a certain class of queries. As part of deciding which
   of your queries will benefit from indexes, it is important to have a
   general understanding of these concepts. See [5]Types of Secondary
   Indexes and [6]Queries that Benefit from Secondary Indexes for more
   information.

How to Design Secondary Indexes

   After you decide which queries can benefit from indexes, determine the
   set of indexes that provide the maximum benefits. See [7]Designing
   Secondary Indexes for more information.

How to Create Secondary Indexes

   You can create secondary indexes using either the [8]MapR Control
   System (MCS) or the [9]maprcli table index command.
   For example, to create a secondary index on the name field, use the
   following maprcli command:
maprcli table index add -path /Data/business -index newIndex -indexedfields name

   See [10]Managing Secondary Indexes for other commands to manage
   secondary indexes.

How to Query MapR Database JSON Tables

   Depending on your use case, applications can access data in MapR
   Database through the following client interfaces:

   [11]OJAI Client API
          Use for user-facing applications that need very high concurrency
          and ultra-low latency. The API is available in Java, Node.js,
          and Python.

   [12]MapR Database JSON REST API
          Use for applications in which you want to access MapR Database
          JSON with HTTP calls.

   [13]MapR Drill SQL
          Use for performing operational analytics or Business
          Intelligence (BI) for medium-to-high complexity queries that
          require low-to-medium concurrency and interactive response
          times.

   These APIs seamlessly select the optimal indexes to use. You do not
   need to write explicit code or provide directives on which indexes to
   use.

   The following diagram summarizes the components involved in the
   different scenarios.

   For OJAI applications, the MapR client chooses the more appropriate of
   two possible execution paths, without user interaction. One of the
   paths leverages the [14]OJAI Distributed Query Service, which supports
   more advanced index selection and parallel query execution. It also
   supports sorting large data sets. For example, if the sort order
   specified in your OJAI query does not match the sort order of an index,
   the MapR client automatically invokes the OJAI Distributed Query
   Service to perform the sort.
