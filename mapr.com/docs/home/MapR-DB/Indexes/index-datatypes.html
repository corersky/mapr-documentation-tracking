Data Types and Secondary Index Fields

   Secondary indexes support a specific set of data types. This section
   describes how indexed and included fields in secondary indexes behave
   for different categories of data types.

Data Types of Indexed Fields

   Prior to MapR 6.1, the indexed fields in a secondary index had to
   contain scalar data. For each scalar data value, MapR Database stored a
   row in the index. See the table in the Scalar Data section of [1]JSON
   Document Data Types for a list of scalar types.

   Beginning with MapR 6.1, indexed fields can also be [2]nested documents
   or [3]arrays, but not array elements. As with scalar data values, MapR
   Database stores a row in the index for each nested document and array.
   The index improves equality filters on the entire nested document or
   array.

   MapR 6.1 also supports using container field paths as indexed fields.

   The following table summarizes what MapR Database supports, depending
   on the characteristics of the indexed field:
   Characteristics of Indexed Field Pre-6.1 Behavior 6.1 Behavior
   Field contains scalar data Supported Supported
   Field contains nested document data Not supported Supported
   Field contains array data Not supported Supported
   Field path is a nested document subfield Supported only if the subfield
   contains scalar data Supported for any data type
   Field is an individual array element Not supported Not supported
   Field uses a container field path Not applicable Supported

   To understand what MapR Database stores for an indexed field defined on
   different data types, consider an example in which you have the
   following documents:
{"_id":"0", "field":0}
{"_id":"1", "field":[0,1,2]}
{"_id":"2", "field":{"subField":1}}
{"_id":"3", "field":{"subField":[1,2,3]}}
{"_id":"4", "field":[{"subField":1},{"subField":2}]}
{"_id":"5", "field":[{"subField":[1,2,3]},{"subField":[4, 5]}]}

   The following table shows what an index defined on field stores and an
   OJAI query condition that matches the value stored in the index:
   Document ID Value Stored in Index Defined on field Matching OJAI Query
   Condition
   0
0

{"$lt":{"field":1}}

   1
[0,1,2]

{"$eq":{"field":[0,1,2]}}

   2
{"subField":1}

{"$eq":{"field":{"subField":1}}}

   3
{"subField":[1,2,3]}

{"$eq":{"field":{"subField":[1,2,3]}}}

   4
[{"subField":1},{"subField":2}]

{"$eq":{"field":[{"subField":1},{"subField":2}]}}

   5
[{"subField":[1,2,3]},{"subField":[4, 5]}]

{"$eq":{"field":[{"subField":[1,2,3]},{"subField":[4,5]}]}}

   The following table shows what an index defined on field.subField
   stores and an OJAI query condition that matches the value stored in the
   index:
   Document ID Value Stored in Index Defined on field.subField Matching
   OJAI Query Condition
   0 Missing ^1 N/A
   1 Missing ^1 N/A
   2
1

{"$lt":{"field.subField":5}}

   3
[1,2,3]

{"$eq":{"field.subField":[1,2,3]}}

   4 Missing ^2 N/A
   5 Missing ^2 N/A
   Note:

   ^1 The index entry for documents 0 and 1 are missing because field is
   not a nested document in these documents.

   ^2 The index entries for documents 3 and 4 are missing because field is
   an array in those documents.

   These indexes enable MapR Database to quickly look up values stored in
   the index. As shown in the table, these values can be scalars, arrays,
   or nested documents. In the case of the latter two types, MapR Database
   can use the index for only equality conditions.

Data Types of Included Fields

   There are no type restrictions on the included fields in an index.

Using Container Field Paths as Indexed Fields

   Starting in MapR 6.1, indexed fields in an index can be [4]Container
   Field Paths. When you use a container field path as your indexed field
   and the field contains an array, then the index contains one row per
   array element. Therefore, the size of your index is proportional to the
   number of elements in the array.
   Important: Consider the storage implications of your index if you
   decide to use a container field path as an indexed field. Also consider
   the performance impact from index updates. Updating an indexed array
   field in a single JSON document may require updating multiple index
   rows.

   When an indexed field is not a container field path, the index contains
   one row per field value.

   For example, suppose you have the same set of documents shown earlier:
{"_id":"0", "field":0}
{"_id":"1", "field":[0,1,2]}
{"_id":"2", "field":{"subField":1}}
{"_id":"3", "field":{"subField":[1,2,3]}}
{"_id":"4", "field":[{"subField":1},{"subField":2}]}
{"_id":"5", "field":[{"subField":[1,2,3]},{"subField":[4, 5]}]}

   The following table shows what each index stores if you define the
   index on the following container field paths:
     * field[]
     * field[].subField
     * field.subField[]
     * field[].subField[]

   Each entry in the table represents a row in the index.
Document ID                         Indexed Field Path
               field[]     field[].subField  field.subField[] field[].subField[]

                          2

                          {"subField":[4, 5]}

[4, 5]

                                             3

            4

5

   Note:

   ^1 The index entries for documents 0 and 1 are missing in all indexes
   except the index on field[] because field is not a nested document.

   ^2 The index entries for documents 3 and 4 are missing in the index on
   field.subField[] because field is an array in those documents.

   To use these indexes, your query condition must use container field
   paths that correspond to the indexed fields. The following are sample
   OJAI query conditions that you might use with each index:
   Indexed Field Path Sample OJAI Query Condition Matching Document(s)
   field[]
{"$eq":{"field[]":0}

   0, 1
{"$eq":{"field[]":{"subField":[1,2,3]}}}

   3, 5
   field[].subField
{"$eq":{"field[].subField":1}}

   2, 4
   field.subField[]
{"$gt":{"field.subField[]":2}}

   3
   field[].subField[]
{"$eq":{"field[].subField[]":2}}

   3, 4, 5

   See [5]OJAI Query Conditions Using Container Field Paths for further
   details about how these types of conditions behave.
   Defining an Index With and Without a Container Field Path

   As shown in these examples, defining an index on a container field path
   is different from defining an index on an entire array field. For
   example, an index on field[] can filter on individual array elements,
   whereas the index on field can filter only the entire value. Similarly,
   defining an index on field[].subField[] provides the most generality.
   It allows you to filter on any elements in subField, regardless of the
   data types in both field and subField. However, you also incur the
   overhead of storing more data in your index and the performance impact
   of updating the index.
   Using Container Field Paths in Covering and Composite Indexes

   With a container field path, you may need to add included fields in
   your index to make the index covering. See [6]Covering Indexes and
   Container Field Paths for details.

   There are also limitations in the composite indexes you can define. See
   [7]Composite Indexes and Container Field Paths for details.

Comparisons and Sorts on Indexed Fields

   Comparisons and sorts across data types differ depending on whether the
   types are comparable or noncomparable. This is not specific to
   secondary indexes. But it impacts comparisons when using secondary
   indexes and the order MapR Database stores data in an index. See
   [8]Using Comparable JSON Document Data Types in Comparisons and Sorts
   and [9]Using Noncomparable JSON Document Data Types in Comparisons and
   Sorts to learn which types fall into each category and to understand
   their behavior.
