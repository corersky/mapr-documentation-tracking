Implementation of Secondary Indexes

   This topic describes how MapR Database implements secondary indexes. It
   provides an overview of basic architectural concepts and the rationale
   behind design choices.

Global Indexes

   MapR Database implements secondary indexes as global indexes rather
   than local indexes. With local indexes, each JSON table's regions (also
   called tablets) has a corresponding index tablet. The JSON table's and
   index's tablets are co-located. In contrast, with a global index, the
   index is a single, separate table with its own tablets and split
   points. Unlike JSON tables, indexes are always auto-split. There is no
   option to disable auto-splitting. When splitting index tablets, indexes
   are range partitioned by default. An alternative to range partitioning
   is to use [1]hash partitioning to avoid creating hot spots.

   Global indexes have the following advantages:
     * They provide an ordering across all values in the indexed fields. A
       scan through the index can generate the sort required by ORDER BY
       clauses.
     * They avoid having to read all partitions. When the data is range
       partitioned, MapR Database can direct index scans to the subset of
       partitions that qualify the desired key range.
     * They require less data processing by minimizing the partitions that
       need to be read.

   In summary, global indexes are well suited for scalable, read intensive
   use cases.

   While global indexes are optimized for read intensive use cases,
   maintaining a global index incurs more overhead. Updates are more
   expensive if the JSON table and its indexes are on different nodes in
   the cluster.

Index Placement

   Each secondary index shares the same volume and topology as its JSON
   table. Users cannot specify the path of an index. This simplifies the
   behavior of snapshot and mirroring.

Data Flow

   After a secondary index has been created on a JSON table, the following
   occurs when an update (put operation) is made to the table:

    1. A document in the JSON table is updated.
    2. The row with the change is replicated to an internal [2]MapR
       gateway.
    3. The MapR gateway determines whether a secondary index is impacted
       and, if so, creates a partial row that contains the secondary
       index's indexed and included fields.
    4. The secondary index row is updated.

   When a secondary index is added, data that is already present in the
   JSON table is propagated to the index using a scan of the JSON table
   that retrieves indexed and included fields. This replaces step 2. Steps
   3 and 4 are executed to populate the index.
