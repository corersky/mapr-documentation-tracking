Types of Secondary Indexes

   MapR Database JSON supports several index types, including simple
   indexes, composite indexes, hashed indexes, and indexes with casting.
   This section describes the properties of these indexes and the
   situations where each provides value.

   The following diagram illustrates the different properties of indexes
   and index fields. Lines connecting properties represent properties that
   can be used in combination with one another. Click on the text in the
   diagram for a description of each property.

Indexed vs Included Fields

   An index consists of indexed and included fields. Indexed fields are
   also referred to as index keys. The following lists describe the
   characteristics of each type of field:

   Indexed Fields

          + Determine the sort order of the index and the order of the
            query result when used
          + Allow filter conditions and ORDER BY conditions defined on
            these fields to be optimized

   Included Fields

          + Do not affect the sort order of the index or the order of the
            query result
          + Prevent reads of the JSON table

   In general, you should define indexed fields on fields you filter and
   order on, and included fields on fields you reference but do not filter
   and order.

   The following example illustrates when you would define an indexed vs
   an included field in your index. Assume you have a MapR Database JSON
   table with the following sample data that contains customer
   information.
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
        {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
        {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
        {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}

   Your query does the following:
    1. Filters on Address.Zipcode
    2. Selects FullName.FirstName and FullName.LastName

   Because your query filters on Address.Zipcode, you should include that
   field as an indexed field. However because you are only selecting on
   FullName.FirstName and FullName.LastName, it suffices to define the
   FullName field as an included field.
maprcli table index add -path /customerInfo -index zipCodeIdx \
   -indexedfields Address.Zipcode \
   -includedfields FullName

   There are additional differences in how indexed and included fields
   behave. The following table summarizes these differences:
   Indexed Field Included Field
   There are some restrictions in the data types of indexed fields. See
   [2]Data Types and Secondary Index Fields for the complete list of
   types. Data types of included fields can be any type. There is no data
   type restriction.
   The collective size of all indexed fields is a maximum of 32KB.
   Included fields do not affect the size limit of an index.
   Adding indexed fields increases the cost of key comparisons when
   scanning the index, due to the increase in the index key size. Adding
   included fields does not impact the index scan cost.

   Included fields influence whether an index is a covering index for a
   query. See [3]Covering Indexes for more information about this concept.

Indexed Field Sort Order

   You can define each field in your index key to sort in either ascending
   or descending order. The default is ascending. Typically, you define
   the sort order to match the ORDER BY clause in your query. This allows
   MapR Database to avoid performing an explicit sort. For example, if you
   issue queries where you return AccountBalance in descending order,
   create the following index.
maprcli table index add -path /customerInfo -index BalanceIdx \
   -indexedfields AccountBalance:-1

Simple vs Composite Indexes

   Simple indexes are indexes with a single indexed field (or key).
   Composite indexes have more than one key. In both cases, you can define
   zero or more included fields. See [4]Simple Indexes and [5]Composite
   Indexes for additional details.

Hashed vs Non-Hashed Indexes

   By default, indexes are stored in sort order across the index key
   values. This can lead to hotspots if the sort order of the index keys
   match the order data is inserted into the JSON table. For example, if
   the indexed field has monotonically increasing timestamp values, such
   as the date a document is created, the tail end of the index becomes a
   hotspot. Hashed indexes avoid hotspotting by evenly distributing index
   writes across a number of logical partitions.
   The following example creates a hashed index named idx on table, tab,
   with a single key, idxKeyCol.
maprcli table index add -path /tab -index idx -indexedfields idxKeyCol \
    -hashed true

   See [6]Hashed Indexes for further details.

Casting

   You can CAST individual indexed fields to a specific data type. This is
   applicable when Drill SQL queries contain CAST expressions. The
   following example creates an index that casts the age field to an INT
   type and the height field to a FLOAT type.
maprcli table index add -path /castTable -index castIdx \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(age@INT)','$CAST(height@FLOAT)'

   See [7]Using Casts in Secondary Indexes for further details.
   Note: This feature only applies for queries issued through the Drill
   SQL interface. The OJAI API does not have CAST support.
