Uses for Secondary Indexes

   Describes typical use cases that can benefit from secondary indexes.

   Operational Analytics
          Operational analytics require highly scalable, highly
          responsive, interactive, user-facing applications.

          Application developers can use OJAI API to build richer and more
          interactive applications. This enables users to retrieve data on
          a variety of columns in MapR-DB JSON tables in a flexible way.
          In addition to processing queries, OJAI also enables them to
          sort on columns and paginate or restrict the results. The
          applications can be operational applications or operational
          analytical applications. For both categories, the level of user
          interactivity and query complexity is high. Sample applications
          include Customer 360, expense reporting systems, game
          management, product catalogs, and a variety of domain-specific
          analytics as a service applications.

   Operational BI and Dashboards
          Typical analytical workloads query snapshots of read-only data.
          Querying against MapR-DB using Drill SQL enables these
          applications to get insights into the latest, changing data.
          Moreover, operational analytical queries usually access only a
          subset of fields from a table, often aggregating the data on a
          variety of dimensions and time ranges. Secondary indexes are
          extremely useful in these use cases. They improve the
          performance of well known query patterns.

   Self-service Data Exploration
          Users want to use their favorite BI reporting tool to issue
          ad-hoc queries against MapR-DB JSON tables. They can achieve a
          simple, high performing data exploration experience using
          MapR-DB and Drill SQL, while leveraging the capabilities of
          both. Using the MapR-DB document model provides end to end JSON
          flexibility at the data storage level. Using Drill SQL provides
          dynamic schema discovery.
