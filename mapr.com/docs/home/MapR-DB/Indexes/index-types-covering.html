Covering Indexes

   A covering index is an index that allows MapR Database to process a
   query using secondary indexes without reading the JSON table. Using it
   makes a query more efficient by avoiding the I/O overhead of fetching
   data from the JSON table.

   If all fields referenced in a query are either indexed or included
   fields in a secondary index, then the secondary index is a covering
   index for that query. MapR Database determines whether an index is
   covering for a query.

   A query that uses a covering index can reference only indexed fields
   from the index or a combination of indexed and included fields. While
   adding included fields to an index enables it to become a covering
   index, note that each field you add to an index increases its storage
   requirement. As the storage size increases, the cost of reading the
   index also increases; likewise, for the cost of adding and updating
   documents. Consider the impact on storage and updates when adding
   included fields to an index.

   In contrast to a covering index, a noncovering index is an index that
   does not store all fields referenced by a query. In this case, lookups
   occur on the JSON table to retrieve the referenced fields that are not
   available in the index itself.

   Whether an index is covering or noncovering depends on the query that
   uses the index. In the example at [1]Types of Secondary Indexes,
   zipCodeIdx is a covering index for the noted query. If the query also
   selects the Gender field, zipCodeIdx is no longer a covering index for
   the query, but it still optimizes the filter condition.

Covering Indexes and Container Field Paths

   When a query uses an index in which the indexed fields are container
   field paths, MapR Database cannot rely on only the indexed fields to
   treat the index as covering. This is due to the way MapR Database
   stores data in an index for container field paths. As described in
   [2]Using Container Field Paths as Indexed Fields, MapR Database stores
   one row in the index for each array element. Thus, reading only the
   rows corresponding to matching array elements might not retrieve the
   other elements of the array.

   To allow an index to be covering in this scenario, the referenced field
   must be an included field in the index.

   For example, using the example at [3]Types of Secondary Indexes,
   suppose you want to run the following query:
     * Filter where Hobbies[] contains "Baseball"
     * Select the FullName and all Hobbies

   For an index to be covering for this query, you must define the index
   with following fields:
     * Indexed Fields: Hobbies[]
     * Included Fields: Hobbies, FullName

   Note: MapR Database disallows you from specifying the same field as
   both an indexed and included field, unless the indexed field is a
   container field path.
