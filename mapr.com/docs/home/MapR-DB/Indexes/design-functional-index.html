Using Casts in Secondary Indexes

   Defining an index that specifies index keys with CAST functions
   provides fast access for queries that contain CAST functions. The index
   converts the indexed field to the type specified by the CAST function
   and stores the result.
   Create indexes using CAST functions if you want to CAST fields to
   specific data types in your queries. To define an index with the CAST
   function applied to a field, specify a CAST when defining the index
   key. The following example creates an index that casts the age field to
   an INT type and the height field to a FLOAT type.
maprcli table index add -path /castTable -index castIdx \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(age@INT)','$CAST(height@FLOAT)'

   When issuing Drill queries through BI tools, you can include CAST
   functions in your queries to create [1]Drill views. Including CAST
   functions provides the metadata needed to optimally process the
   queries. For more information about using the CAST function with Drill,
   see [2]Data Type Conversion.

Casting from NULL in Drill

   You can cast from null to any data type supported by the indexes with
   the CAST function. However, null can be a valid JSON value for the
   string data type, for example:
{ "name": null }

   Null can also represent the absence of an actual value, for example:
{ "_id":1,"name":"Annie" }
{ "_id":2 }  (name does not exist)

   When you cast on columns with missing values, Drill does not return
   null for the missing values. Drill only returns null in cases where an
   actual value of null exists.
   For example, if you have the following data stored in a JSON table
   named t1:
   a1 b1
   1  'abc'
   2  null
   3  'null'
   And you issue the following query against the table:
SELECT a1, b1(cast b1 as varchar(20))) from t1;

   Drill returns the following data:
   a1 b1
   1  abc
   2
   3  null
   Drill does not return null where null represents a missing value. Drill
   only returns null in the instance where null is stored as a string
   value.

Guidelines for Using Casts in Indexes

   The following rules apply to CAST functions used in secondary indexes:
     * You can include the CAST function only on indexed fields.
     * You do not have to cast between comparable data types.
     * Indexes support casting to the following data types:
          + Boolean
          + String
          + Int
          + Long
          + Float
          + Double
          + Date
          + Time
          + Timestamp
       Note: MapR Database does not support casting from any data type to
       byte, short, decimal, binary, or interval.
       Note: Queries that use the CAST function on fields with timestamp
       and binary data types are not supported.
     * When casting to a string type, you can optionally specify a length.
       If you do not specify a length, it defaults to the maximum length
       of 255.
     * When casting a float or double type to a string type, you cannot
       control the precision of the digits in the resulting string value.
       Float and double are approximate representations of decimal values.
     * When casting from a binary type, MapR Database assumes that the
       binary value is a UTF-8 formatted string representation of the
       resulting data type.
     * If MapR Database cannot cast a value, MapR Database indexes the row
       with an encoding error that specifies a CAST issue.
     * You cannot cast all data types to the supported data types. See the
       Casting Matrix below for supported and unsupported combinations.

Casting Matrix

   The following matrix displays supported and unsupported casting, from
   the data type shown in the column to the data type shown in the row. Y
   indicates a supported casting; N indicates an unsupported casting.
   Hyphen (-) indicates that casting is unnecessary, because the data
   types are comparable.

   ^1 When casting int/long to a date type, the date value is constructed
   based on the int/long value being the number of milliseconds since
   epoch.

   ^2 When casting int/long to a time type, the time value is constructed
   based on the int/long value being the time of day in milliseconds.

   ^3 MapR Database casts the strings true, yes, on, y, t, and 1 to
   boolean true. MapR Database casts the strings false, no, off, n, f, and
   0 to boolean false.

   ^4 The string represents the time in UTC timezone.

Example Using Cast Function in an Index

   This example shows you how to create an index with the CAST function.
   The following statement queries a table named lineitem and casts the
   L_LINENUMBER and L_ORDERKEY fields to the int data type:
SELECT L_LINESTATUS, L_QUANTITY FROM lineitem WHERE CAST(L_LINENUMBER as int) =
1 AND CAST(L_ORDERKEY as int) = 550;

   You can create an index on the L_LINENUMBER and L_ORDERKEY fields and
   indicate the use of the CAST function and data type for each field, as
   shown below:
maprcli table index add -path /drill/testdata/qa/sf1/maprdb/json/lineitem -index
 l_cast_comp_1 \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(L_LINENUMBER@INT)','$CAST(L_ORDERKEY@INT)' \
   -includedfields L_LINESTATUS,L_QUANTITY

   The index stores the values of the L_LINENUMBER and L_ORDERKEY fields
   as the int data type. MapR Database can use the index for any
   subsequent queries that use the CAST function to retrieve these fields
   as the int type, instead of accessing data in the primary table and
   converting the values to int.
   Note: If you created an index on the L_LINENUMBER and L_ORDERKEY fields
   without the CAST function, the query used in this example would not
   benefit from the index.
