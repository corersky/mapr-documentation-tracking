Viewing Secondary Index Details

   Describes how to use MCS to view more specific details on secondary
   indexes.

   You can view secondary index details using the MapR Control System.
    1. Go to the Indexes tab in the [1]table information page for the JSON
       table.
    2. Click the name of the index to display the details.
       The page displays Summary and Metrics tabs.
          + [2]Summary
          + [3]Metrics
       The Summary tab displays the following:

        Throughput - By Op Type
                See [4]Viewing Throughput by Operation Type Using the MapR
                Control System

        Region Distribution
                See [5]Viewing Region Distribution.

        SETTINGS AND AUDITING
                Displays the index name, whether or not the index is
                hashed and if hashed, the number of hashed partitions, the
                status of the index and if the index is current, and the
                number of bytes, puts, and buckets that are yet to be
                replicated to the index.

        INCLUDED FIELDS
                The fields in the JSON table that are indexed, but not
                used for ordering.

        FIELDS INDEXED
                The fields in the JSON table that are indexed and used for
                ordering.

       The Summary tab displays charts for the secondary index metrics.
       For more information, see [6]Viewing Secondary Index Metrics.
