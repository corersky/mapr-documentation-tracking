Simple Indexes

   A simple index is a secondary index that has only one indexed field and
   zero or more included fields. Simple indexes enable you to optimize
   queries that filter and sort on a single field. If all fields
   referenced in a query are either indexed or included fields in a simple
   index, then you can process the query by reading only the index.

Sort Order

   MapR Database sorts simple indexes on the single indexed field. MapR
   Database sorts the indexed field values in ascending order by default,
   although you can specify a descending order when you create the index.
   Sorting indexes benefits your ORDER BY queries because the index
   eliminates the need for a SORT operator in the query plan.

Simple Index Examples

   The following demonstrate the [1]CLI commands you can use to create
   various types of simple indexes. For these examples, assume that you
   have a MapR Database JSON table with the following sample data:
{
   "_id": "10000",
   "FullName": {
      "LastName": "Smith",
      "FirstName": "John"
   },
   "Address": {
      "Street": "123 SE 22nd St.",
      "City": "Oakland",
      "State": "CA",
      "Zipcode": "94601-1001"
   },
   "Gender": "M",
   "AccountBalance": 999.99,
   "Email": "john.smith@company.com",
   "Phones": [
       {"Type": "Home", "Number": "555-555-1234"},
       {"Type": "Mobile", "Number": "555-555-5678"},
       {"Type": "Work", "Number": "555-555-9012"}
   ],
   "Hobbies": ["Baseball", "Cooking", "Reading"],
   "DateOfBirth": "10/1/1985"
}
