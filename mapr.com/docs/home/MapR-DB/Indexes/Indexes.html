Secondary Indexes

   Beginning with MapR 6.0, MapR Database JSON natively supports secondary
   indexes on fields in JSON tables. Indexes provide you with flexible,
   high performance access to data stored in MapR Database.

How Do I Get Started?

   The following diagram provides links to topics you need to understand
   and use Secondary Indexes. This includes conceptual information about
   indexes, how to decide what indexes to create, how to set up and use
   indexes, the maprcli commands used to create and maintain indexes, and
   how to query your data to leverage indexes. The information is
   organized based on roles.

What are Secondary Indexes?

   A secondary index (also sometimes referred to in this documentation as
   an index) is a special [2]table that stores a subset of document fields
   from a JSON table. The index orders its data on a set of fields,
   defined as the indexed fields. This is in contrast to the JSON table
   that orders its data on the table's primary key (rowId or rowKey). If
   you have administrator privileges, you can create one or more indexes
   on each JSON table. After the indexes are created, applications can
   leverage them to accelerate query response times.

   Secondary indexes provide efficient access to a wider range of queries
   on data in MapR Database. They allow queries to efficiently query data
   through fields other than the primary key. This results in MapR
   Database supporting a broader set of use cases. Applications that
   benefit include rich, interactive business applications and user-facing
   analytic applications. Secondary indexes also enable Business
   Intelligence tools and ad-hoc queries on operational datasets. See
   [3]Uses for Secondary Indexes for more information.
   Important: Secondary indexes can be created only on MapR Database JSON
   tables.

Why Use Secondary Indexes?

   With the ever increasing amount of data stored in MapR Database JSON,
   indexing that data becomes critical. Without indexes, queries
   unnecessarily scan large amounts of data from the underlying JSON
   table. Queries could potentially scan every document in the table, even
   if they contain conditions that limit the documents to select. Query
   performance suffers and resource bottlenecks are inevitable when you
   use this data model.

   Without indexes, applications and query layers resort to limited
   interactivity to avoid performance concerns. Using indexes solves this
   limitation in application scale, by reducing the number of documents
   client applications read, even when querying large data sets. This
   reduces I/O and CPU costs, resulting in improved performance.

   The functionality and benefits of indexing available in MapR Database
   are similar to that of indexes in relational databases. The difference
   is that MapR Database indexes provide performance benefits at high
   scale, in combination with JSON flexibility on the query side and
   simplicity on the management side.

How Can I Use Secondary Indexes?

   You can leverage MapR Database secondary indexes by using either the
   OJAI API, the MapR Database JSON REST API, or MapR Drill.

   OJAI is the business application development interface on MapR
   Database. Typically, business applications are characterized by ultra
   low latency and extremely high throughput. When you build an
   application using OJAI, filtering and sorting through the API can
   leverage secondary indexes to accelerate query response times.

   The MapR Database JSON REST API enables you to use HTTP calls to
   perform basic operations on MapR Database JSON tables, including
   querying.

   Drill is the analytics SQL interface on MapR Database. Drill is a
   distributed SQL query engine that provides interactive response time
   for operational analytics, Business Intelligence (BI) tools like
   Tableau, and ad-hoc queries on MapR Database. With MapR Drill, SQL
   queries can also leverage secondary indexes to accelerate query
   response times.

   Regardless of whether queries originate from OJAI or Drill SQL, each
   interface seamlessly selects the optimal indexes to use. You do not
   need to write explicit code or provide directives on which indexes to
   use. If an appropriate index exists for a query, MapR Database
   leverages the index.

     * [5]Node.js OJAI Client API
