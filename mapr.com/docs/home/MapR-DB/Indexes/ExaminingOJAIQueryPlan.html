Examining the OJAI Query Plan

   This section describes two ways to access a Java OJAI query plan and
   provides general information about how to interpret the query plan. You
   can examine the query plan to determine if the Java OJAI client chooses
   an appropriate execution path.

Using OJAI Tracing

   After following the steps at [1]Determining the Query Execution Path
   for OJAI Queries, if you determine that your query directly accesses
   MapR Database JSON and does not use the OJAI Distributed Query Service,
   you can further examine the query plan in the trace output.

   As noted in the referenced topic, to enable tracing, set the following
   property in your log4j.properties file, located in the /opt/mapr/conf
   directory:
log4j.logger.com.mapr.ojai.store.impl=TRACE, stdout

   In the following logged output, the query plan uses an index named
   i1_idx and projects field id1. It also limits the result to two
   documents:
2017-10-18 11:29:32,876 TRACE [main] com.mapr.ojai.store.impl.OjaiDocumentStore
- Query Plan: '[{"streamName":"DBDocumentStream","parameters":{"queryConditionPa
th":false,"indexName":"i1_idx","projectionPath":["id1"],"primaryTable":"/tmp/tes
t-728918932/tab"}},{"streamName":"LimitStream","parameters":{"limit":2}}]'

Calling QueryResult.getQueryPlan

   Instead of using OJAI tracing, you can programmatically retrieve query
   plans by calling [2]QueryResult.getQueryPlan. The method returns a JSON
   document that is a list of Maps. Each Map in the list represents a
   DocumentStream in the query plan, which corresponds to an operation.
   The order of the list represents the order the MapR Database client
   processes each operation. Each Map entry contains the name of the
   DocumentStream (streamName) and its parameters. You may see Map entries
   corresponding to the following DocumentStreams in a query plan:
     * DBDocumentStream - Accesses MapR Database without the OJAI
       Distributed Query Service
     * DrillDocumentStream - Uses the OJAI Distributed Query Service to
       process the query
     * LimitStream - Limits the number of documents to return
     * OffsetStream - Skips past specified number of documents before
       reading

   Important: The DocumentStream names and their parameters are subject to
   change from one release to the next. Take that into consideration if
   you plan to write tools that interpret the contents of an OJAI query
   plan
