Preparing Clusters for Querying using Secondary Indexes on JSON Tables

   Describes the tasks needed to prepare your environment so you can query
   MapR-DB JSON tables using secondary indexes.

Installing with the MapR Installer

   To install MapR using the MapR installer, follow the steps outlined at
   [1]Installing with the MapR Installer.

   Starting with MapR 6.0.1, you do not have to enable a separate query
   service to use secondary indexes. The Operational Applications with
   MapR-DB template installs and configures the replication gateways
   needed to update secondary indexes in MapR-DB JSON and includes the
   components needed to run OJAI queries.

   You must enable the [2]OJAI Distributed Query Service to use certain
   features. The following table summarizes the differences in the
   functionality of OJAI queries when you do and do not have the service
   enabled:
                     Service Not Enabled                  Service Enabled
     * Can run queries that use a single secondary index
     * Can sort data in your queries up to a configurable limit

     * Can run queries that use multiple secondary indexes
     * Can sort data in your queries without any limit
     * Can run queries in parallel

   Selecting any of the following templates enables the OJAI Distributed
   Query Service:
     * Operational Applications with MapR-DB and Distributed Query Service
     * MapR Converged Cluster: Batch, interactive and real-time analytics
     * Analytics with MapR-DB

   You can also explicitly enable the OJAI Distributed Query Service by
   selecting the service in the Custom Services template.

   For more information about installer templates, see
   [3]Auto-Provisioning Templates.

   For more information about how secondary index selection and execution
   works in MapR-DB JSON, see [4]Selection and Execution of Secondary
   Indexes.
   Note: The OJAI Query Service has been renamed to the OJAI Distributed
   Query Service in MapR 6.0.1. All information about the OJAI Distributed
   Query Service applies to the OJAI Query Service, except where noted.

Installing without the MapR Installer

   Other sections of the documentation describe the detailed steps for
   installing and configuring without the MapR installer. Generally, you
   need to perform the following steps:
    1. Install software.
       To install MapR without using the MapR installer, follow the steps
       outlined at [5]Installing without the MapR Installer. In addition
       to installing MapR core packages, you also need to [6]install MapR
       Drill if you want advanced secondary index selection, sorts on
       large data sets, and parallel query execution. When installing
       Drill, make sure to [7]Configure the OJAI Distributed Query
       Service.
    2. Install and configure replication gateways.
       Updates are propagated from the JSON tables using the [8]Gateways
       for Replicating MapR-DB Tables. You need to install the replication
       gateways. Since the source JSON table and the secondary index are
       on the same volume within a cluster, configure an [9]intracluster
       gateway. In this type of gateway, the source and destination
       clusters are the same.
       If your gateways are running on the same nodes as CLDB, then no
       additional configuration steps are required. See [10]Configuring
       Gateways for Table and Stream Replication for details about this
       scenario and other options for configuring your gateways.

Upgrades

   Other sections of the documentation describe the detailed steps for
   upgrades. Generally, you need to perform the following steps:
    1. Upgrade your MapR software by following the instructions at
       [11]Upgrading MapR or MEP Components.
    2. [12]Install MapR Drill, if you have not already done so and want to
       sort large data sets and run queries in parallel.
    3. When installing Drill, make sure to [13]Configure the OJAI
       Distributed Query Service.
    4. If you are upgrading without the MapR installer, follow step 2 in
       the previous section to install and configure replication gateways.
    5. Enable the replication support needed to propagate index updates by
       running the following command:
maprcli cluster feature enable â€“name mfs.feature.db.streams.v6.support
       See [14]Step 4: Enable New Features for further details.
