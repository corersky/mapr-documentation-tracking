Troubleshooting Secondary Indexes

   Describes how to debug and troubleshoot usage of secondary indexes.

   The following table lists problems you may encounter when using
   secondary indexes. Based on the symptoms listed in the first column,
   refer to the section in the third column to further troubleshoot the
   issue.

Secondary Index Restrictions

   When troubleshooting secondary indexes, you should also keep in mind
   the following restrictions:

   Type Restrictions

          + If a composite index includes the same subfield in multiple
            indexed fields, the implied types of the subfields must be
            consistent.
            For example, you cannot create an index with the following
            indexed fields:
a.b[].c, a.b.d
            Although subfield b appears in both indexed fields, in the
            first, it is an array and in the second, it is a nested
            document.
            See [8]Composite Indexes and Container Field Paths for more
            details.

   Size Restrictions

          + The maximum size of all indexed fields in an index is 32 KB.
            If the collective size exceeds 32 KB, then an insert of the
            corresponding document results in an encoding error
            (INDEX_ROW_KEY_ENCODER_ERROR_ENCODING_IS_TOO_LONG).
          + The maximum number of indexes that you can create on a JSON
            table is 32.

   Field Definition Restrictions

          + You cannot specify individual array elements as indexed
            fields.
          + You cannot specify a table's _id field as an indexed field.
          + If a field contains an array of nested documents and you want
            to index on subfields in the nested documents, then you must
            define the indexed field using a container field path.
          + You can include a specific field only once as either an
            indexed or included field, with the following two exceptions:
               o The indexed field is a container field path:
maprcli table index add -path /people \
   -index phoneNumberIdx \
   -indexedfields Phones[].Number \
   -includedfields Phones[].Number
               o The field specifies a cast to another type.
                 You can create an index in which the score field is an
                 indexed field cast as a double type, and score is also an
                 included field. The included field retains the original
                 data type of the score field:
maprcli table index add -path /castTable \
   -index castIdx1 \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(score@DOUBLE)' \
   -includedFields score
                 You can create an index in which the score field is an
                 indexed field, cast as a double type, and the score field
                 is also another indexed field, cast as a long type:
maprcli table index add -path /castTable \
   -index castIdx2 \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(score@DOUBLE)','$CAST(score@LONG)'
          + You cannot use casts with included fields.
          + You cannot specify a field as either an indexed or included
            field if the field is also specified as a column family JSON
            path name.
            For example, suppose you have the following JSON table:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                         "d" : "value"
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}
            If you create a column family at field c in the JSON path
            a.b.c, you cannot define field a.b.c as either an indexed or
            included field. You can define the fields a, a.b, and a.b.d as
            either indexed or included fields.
          + You cannot specify an included field in which the data in the
            field spans more than one column family.
            In the following example, the included field sl1.sl2 spans
            column families, cf2 and cf3:
maprcli table cf list -path /cftab
compressionperm  readperm  traverseperm  jsonfamilypath   writeperm  minversions
  maxversions  compression  ttl         inmemory  cfname   memoryperm
u:root           u:root    u:root                         u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     default  u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1              u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf1      u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1.sl2.sl3      u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf2      u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4  u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf3      u:root

maprcli table index add -path /cftab -index i1 -indexedfields sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4.l4
a, sl1.l1a -includedfields sl1.sl2,sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4.sl5.l5b -json
{
        "timestamp":1507419777919,
        "timeofday":"2017-10-07 04:42:57.919 GMT-0700 PM",
        "status":"ERROR",
        "errors":[
                {
                        "id":22,
                        "desc":"Data for included field sl1.sl2 may not span mor
e than one column family."
                }
         ]
}
          + You cannot specify a composite index with more than one
            container field path as your indexed fields, unless the
            prefixes of the container field paths are the same.
            See [9]Composite Indexes and Container Field Paths for more
            details.
          + You cannot specify a composite index with an indexed field
            that is a subfield of another indexed field.
            For example, you cannot create an index with the following
            indexed fields:
a, a.b
            The indexed field a.b is a subfield of the indexed field a.

   Option Restrictions

          + Because indexes are automatically split, you cannot disable
            splits when you create your index.

   Index Use Restrictions

          + Indexes do not optimize non-existence filter conditions.
