Troubleshooting Secondary Indexes

   Describes how to debug and troubleshoot usage of secondary indexes.

   The following table lists problems you may encounter when using
   secondary indexes. Based on the symptoms listed in the first column,
   refer to the section in the third column to further troubleshoot the
   issue.

Secondary Index Restrictions

   When troubleshooting secondary indexes, you should also keep in mind
   the following restrictions:

   Type Restrictions

          + Indexed fields must contain scalar types.
            Scalar types include integer, character, boolean, string, and
            byte. See [8]Data Types and Secondary Index Fields for the
            complete list of types.
          + Indexed fields cannot contain nested documents.
            An indexed field can be a subfield of a nested document,
            provided the subfield contains scalar types.
          + Indexed fields cannot contain arrays.

   Size Restrictions

          + The maximum size of all indexed fields in an index is 32 KB.
            If the collective size exceeds 32 KB, then an insert of the
            corresponding document results in an encoding error
            (INDEX_ROW_KEY_ENCODER_ERROR_ENCODING_IS_TOO_LONG).
          + The maximum number of indexes that you can create on a JSON
            table is 32.

   Field Definition Restrictions

          + Indexed fields cannot be individual elements of an array.
          + You can include a specific field only once as either an
            indexed or included field, except if you cast the field to
            different types.
            For example:
               o You can create an index in which the score field is an
                 indexed field cast as a double type, and score is also an
                 included field.
                 The included field retains the original data type of the
                 score field.
maprcli table index add -path /castTable \
   -index castIdx1 \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(score@DOUBLE)' \
   -includedFields score
               o You can create an index in which the score field is an
                 indexed field, cast as a double type, and the score field
                 is also another indexed field, cast as a long type.
maprcli table index add -path /castTable \
   -index castIdx2 \
   -indexedfields '$CAST(score@DOUBLE)','$CAST(score@LONG)'
          + You cannot use casts with included fields.
          + You cannot specify a field as either an indexed or included
            field if the field is also specified as a column family JSON
            path name.
            For example, suppose you have the following JSON table:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                         "d" : "value"
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}
            If you create a column family at field c in the JSON path
            a.b.c, you cannot define field a.b.c as either an indexed or
            included field. You can define the fields a, a.b, and a.b.d as
            either indexed or included fields.
          + You cannot specify an included field in which the data in the
            field spans more than one column family.
            In the following example, the included field sl1.sl2 spans
            column families, cf2 and cf3:
maprcli table cf list -path /cftab
compressionperm  readperm  traverseperm  jsonfamilypath   writeperm  minversions
  maxversions  compression  ttl         inmemory  cfname   memoryperm
u:root           u:root    u:root                         u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     default  u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1              u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf1      u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1.sl2.sl3      u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf2      u:root
u:root           u:root    u:root        sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4  u:root     0
  1            lz4          2147483647  false     cf3      u:root

maprcli table index add -path /cftab -index i1 -indexedfields sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4.l4
a, sl1.l1a -includedfields sl1.sl2,sl1.sl2.sl3.sl4.sl5.l5b -json
{
        "timestamp":1507419777919,
        "timeofday":"2017-10-07 04:42:57.919 GMT-0700 PM",
        "status":"ERROR",
        "errors":[
                {
                        "id":22,
                        "desc":"Data for included field sl1.sl2 may not span mor
e than one column family."
                }
         ]
}

   Option Restrictions

          + Because indexes are automatically split, you cannot disable
            splits when you create your index.

   Index Use Restrictions

          + Indexes optimize filter conditions if you compare indexed
            fields against scalar values, and the field and scalar value
            have [9]comparable types.
          + Indexes do not optimize non-existence filter conditions.
