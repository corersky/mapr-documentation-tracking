Selection and Execution of Secondary Indexes

   This section provides an overview of secondary index selection and
   execution in MapR Database JSON. It describes the variations in
   functionality, depending on the components you are using.

   The following diagram summarizes the code paths and the components
   involved when using secondary indexes in MapR Database JSON. See
   [1]OJAI Distributed Query Service for more information about the
   components and code paths.

Index Selection

   All three code paths use a cost-based approach to select an optimal
   query plan. Cost based optimization chooses between alternatives where
   it may not be obvious which is the better index to use. Assume that you
   have the following two indexing options:
     * Index 1 can be used to filter condition A in a query but cannot
       satisfy the sort criteria.
     * Index 2 can be used to filter condition B in a query and also
       satisfy the sort criteria.

   If filter condition A is more selective than filter condition B,
   although using index 1 requires reading less data, it requires a sort
   of the data. In contrast, using index 2 requires reading more data but
   does not incur the cost of sorting the data. A cost based optimizer
   estimates the cost of both options and chooses the one with the lower
   cost. It also estimates the cost of of a full table scan. It may choose
   the full table scan if the index-based plans do not use selective
   filters.

   The Simple OJAI Query code path can use indexes even when a query does
   not have filter or ORDER BY conditions that match the fields of an
   index. See [2]Using Indexes to Optimize Projections in Queries for
   details.

   The Drill query optimizer and the optimizer used by the OJAI
   Distributed Query Service can select [3]multiple indexes to process a
   query. The OJAI Distributed Query Service scans the indexes and takes
   the intersection of the matching documents from each index. The MapR
   client invokes scans of only a single index.

   The rest of this section generally discusses the optimizer flow. Except
   where noted, the discussion applies to the optimizer used in all three
   code paths.

   MapR Database gives the optimizer a list of indexes associated with the
   JSON table referenced in the query. The optimizer enumerates through
   the possible index choices using the following steps:
    1. Identifies the set of indexes whose keys match filter conditions
       and possibly also the ORDER BY specification.
    2. Estimates the cost of using each index.
    3. Considers combinations of indexes and estimates the cost of these
       combinations. (Applies to the Drill and OJAI Distributed Query
       Service optimizers only.)

   Using the cost estimates, the optimizer selects the index (or indexes)
   with the lowest cost, or if appropriate, a full table scan. The cost is
   a function of the index properties, table size, and selectivity of the
   filter conditions applied. Each of these factors contribute to the
   estimated cost in the following ways:

   Index Properties
          MapR Database provides the Drill optimizer with index
          properties. Index properties include the fields that comprise
          the index, whether the field is an indexed or included field,
          and the sort direction of each indexed field.

   Table Size
          MapR Database maintains information about table regions,
          including table size. The optimizer uses table size when
          calculating the cost of the query plan.

          If JSON tables are small and fit into a single region, the
          overhead of using indexes on the table may not provide enough
          performance benefits to justify an index-based plan. In such a
          scenario, the optimizer could calculate a full table scan as
          cheaper to perform than an index scan, rendering any index on
          the table unnecessary. Even if you apply selective filters on
          small tables, the overhead of using indexes may not provide
          performance benefits.

   Filter Selectivity
          Filter Selectivity is the estimated number of rows based on the
          selectivity of each conditional expression in the WHERE clause.
          Filter selectivity is calculated as:

(output row count)/(total table row count)

          For example, if you have 100 documents and 25 documents qualify
          the filter condition, the selectivity is .25.

          Filter selectivity ranges between 0 and 1. The closer to 0, the
          more selective the filter. The more selective a filter, the
          lower the cost. High filter selectivity results in better query
          performance. If filter conditions are not selective enough for
          the optimizer to choose the index, remove the index to free up
          storage.

          For example, defining an index on a field like gender, which has
          only two possible values, does not result in selective
          filtering. Consider adding other fields to define a composite
          index to make filtering with that index more selective. In
          general, define indexes on high cardinality fields unless your
          queries also sort on those fields.

          For [4]covering queries, Drill selects an index plan if the
          number of rows selected is less than or equal to .75 of the
          total number of rows in the JSON table. If the number of rows
          selected is greater than .75 of the total number of rows in the
          JSON table, Drill performs a full table scan.

          For non-covering queries, the threshold is .025.

   Note: In the Simple OJAI Queries code path, if you are using the OJAI
   API, you can force the MapR client to use a particular index,
   regardless of cost considerations. See [5]Forcing Secondary Index Usage
   in OJAI for details.

Index Execution

   After either the MapR client or Drill select an optimal query plan,
   MapR Database has the index (or list of indexes, in the case of a plan
   generated by Drill) it needs to read from. It reads the index to
   retrieve the corresponding documents from the JSON table. The following
   diagram and table illustrate the flow for a read from a [6]composite
   index created on fields a and b.

   Step # Description Details
   1 Initiates index search MapR Database searches the index, starting at
   the condition a >= 3.
   2 Applies additional filters

   MapR Database applies the filter condition on field b. It either moves
   to step 3 or 4, depending on whether the condition b = 'X' matches.

   For example, when b contains the value 'X', it proceeds to step 3. When
   b contains the value 'Y', it skips to step 4.
   3 Retrieves JSON document Using the rowkey in the entry, MapR Database
   reads the corresponding JSON document.
   4 Continues index reads until non-match

   MapR Database reads the subsequent index keys provided they match the
   filter condition a < 10. If the condition matches, it goes back to step
   2. Otherwise, MapR Database stops search.

   For example, the reads stop when MapR Database reads the value 10 from
   field a.
   Note: In the case where a [7]covering index satisfies the query, MapR
   Database skips reading the JSON table. There is no need for this read
   because the index provides all selected fields. In the example above,
   MapR Database skips step 3.
