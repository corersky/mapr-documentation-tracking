Listing Secondary Indexes

   Describes how to list information about the secondary indexes created
   on MapR Database JSON tables.

   You can view secondary indexes using the MapR Control System (MCS) or
   the maprcli table index commands. You need the following permissions.
     * readAce on the volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the table path

   Note: The mapr user is not treated as a superuser. MapR Database does
   not allow the mapr user to perform this operation unless that user is
   given the relevant permission or permissions with access-control
   expressions.

Listing Indexes in the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Indexes tab in the [1]table information
   page.
   The list of indexes displays in the All indexes pane and for each
   index, the page displays the following:

   CAPTION:

   Column Name Column Description
   Index Name The name of the index
   Fields Indexed The number of fields on the JSON table that are indexed
   and used for ordering
   Fields Covered The number of fields on the JSON table that are indexed,
   but not used for ordering
   State The replication state of the index
   Up to Date Whether the index is up to date
   Hashed Whether the index is hashed
   Size The size of the index
   To view more details on individual indexes, see [2]Viewing Secondary
   Index Details.

Listing Indexes Using the CLI

   The following is basic command for listing secondary indexes.
maprcli table index list
            -path <path>
            -refreshnow < true | false >

   See [3]table index list for more information.
