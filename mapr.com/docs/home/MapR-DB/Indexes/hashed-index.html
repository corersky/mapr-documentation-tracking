Hashed Indexes

   A hashed index is a secondary index that distributes keys across
   logical partitions to avoid creating hot spots when MapR Database
   updates the index with new keys from the JSON table.

   Hot spots occur when data inserted into an indexed field has
   monotonically increasing values, or when a burst of write activity
   occurs. The former occurs with timestamp values. The latter occurs when
   you have a burst of updates on an indexed field over a small range of
   values. Hashed indexes enable MapR Database to evenly distribute new
   writes on an index and avoid hot spots.
   Note: Hashed indexes do not resolve hot spots on the JSON table. For
   information about how to design rowkeys and avoid hot spots in the JSON
   table, see [1]Table Rowkey Design.

   Hashed indexes support the same conditional queries as non-hashed
   indexes, except that hashed indexes do not have a guaranteed sort
   order. Hashed indexes do not support ORDER BY queries due to the
   distribution of data across logical partitions. Consequently, sorting
   is performed by the query layer, which can increase the CPU costs and
   negatively impact performance.
   By default, MapR Database creates ten partitions for a hashed index.
   You can modify this value when you create a hashed index using the
   [2]maprcli table index add command or through the [3]MCS. When a hashed
   index exists, MapR Database distributes table updates to the index
   across the logical partitions, which reside on different nodes. MapR
   Database orders the keys within each partition instead of ordering them
   across the entire index.
   Note: Once you create an index with hashing enabled, you cannot disable
   hashing. You can remove the hashed index and then create a non-hashed
   (default) index on the field. See [4]Removing Indexes and [5]Adding
   Indexes.

Guidelines on Creating Hashed Indexes

     * Create a hashed index on fields with monotonically increasing
       values, such as timestamp values.
     * Create a hashed index on a fields that MapR Database updates in
       bursts of write activity, for example when MapR Database updates a
       small range of possible values for the indexed field.
     * Do not create hashed indexes for ORDER BY queries.
     * Use the maprcli table index list command or the MCS to determine if
       an index is hashed. See [6]maprcli table index list or [7]Listing
       Indexes.
     * After you create an index with hashing enabled, you cannot disable
       hashing.

Example Comparison of a Non-Hashed Index and Hashed Index

   The following images depict a non-hashed (default) index and a hashed
   index. For the purpose of this example, assume that an index was
   created on the DateCreated field of a JSON table in MapR Database.
   Yellow highlighted areas indicate updates to the index.

   Non-Hashed (Default) Index
   The non-hashed index propagates DateCreated field updates from the JSON
   table to the index. Notice that the dates are sorted within the index
   and no partitions exist. Depending on the size of the index, the index
   may exist on one or multiple nodes

   .

   Hashed Index
   The hashed index propagates DateCreated field updates across the index
   partitions which reside on different nodes. Notice that dates are
   sorted within each partition and each partition resides on a different
   node.
