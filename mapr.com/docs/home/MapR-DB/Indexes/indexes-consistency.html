Asynchronous Secondary Index Updates

   Secondary indexes are updated asynchronously. The asynchronous approach
   favors performance and scalability over synchronous, transactional
   updates. However, this also means that indexed data can be stale
   compared to data in the JSON table, even though the data eventually
   becomes consistent with the JSON table data.

Impact of Asynchronous Indexes

   By updating the index asynchronously, this avoids delaying updates to
   the JSON table.

   From a user point of view, secondary indexes updates are complete when
   the MapR-DB table data appears in the index. This occurs without
   application developers having to write any explicit code. Because
   indexes are asynchronously updated relative to the JSON table, there is
   a lag in updates appearing in the index. For a reasonably sized
   cluster, secondary index updates will typically occur within a few
   seconds of the update on the JSON table. When the JSON table and its
   secondary indexes are on separate nodes, the updates to the index are
   more expensive. The lag is potentially higher.

   The following example illustrates how the lag in updates impacts
   queries that use indexes.

   Suppose you have a JSON table that has a document with _id=DOC1. An
   update occurs on the indexed field, a.b.c, changing the value from v1
   to v2. For queries that use a [1]covering index, any of the following
   values might be returned for the (_id, a.b.c) pair:
     * Only (DOC1,v1) - This occurs if the new value v2 has not yet been
       indexed.
     * Only (DOC1,v2) - This occurs if the new value v2 is indexed and the
       old value v1 is deleted.
     * Both (DOC1,v1) and (DOC1,v2) - This occurs if the new value v2 is
       indexed and the old value v1 is not yet deleted.
     * Neither (DOC1,v1) nor (DOC1,v2) - This occurs if the value v1 is
       not indexed. The newer value v2 is not yet indexed, because value
       v1 is always indexed first.

   For queries that use non-covering indexes, MapR-DB re-reads the indexed
   and included fields when reading additional fields from the JSON table.
   This ensures that the query results are consistent in spite of update
   lags.

   In the case where a non-covering index provides the ordering for the
   ORDER BY specification of a query, index lag can result in a partial
   sort of the result. See [2]Partial Sorts with Non-Covering Indexes for
   further details.

   See [3]Troubleshooting Secondary Indexes for information about how to
   determine if an index is lagging its JSON table.

Snapshots

   Queries against snapshots containing tables with secondary indexes can
   return inconsistent results. This occurs if the data queried is
   actively changing at the time of snapshot creation. When creating a
   snapshot, if a secondary index on a JSON table does not have current
   data due to asynchronous updates of the index, the snapshot retains the
   lag in updates. The lag leads to the following behavior, which is
   similar to the behavior discussed in the previous section.
     * For a query using a covering index, if the indexed data is out of
       sync, the query could return data that is current, old, or both.
     * For a query using a non-covering index, if the indexed data is out
       of sync, the query returns the most recent data records.

   Important: Unlike data in the original volume, with snapshots, any lag
   between a JSON table and its secondary index will never get resolved.
   The snapshot data is read-only and never updated..

Mirroring

   Queries against mirror volumes behave like queries against snapshots.
   Lags in the source volume carry over into the mirror volume. Upon
   refreshing a mirror volume, the lag can resolve itself.

Reading Your Own Write Operations

   Certain classes of applications require users to immediately see the
   data they have written. In these cases, getting stale data can confuse
   users. Think about an expense report application example where the user
   enters his expenses and wants to immediately see the entries. The
   asynchronous nature of indexes could be an issue in such a case. To
   avoid the possibility of reading stale data due to asynchronous
   indexes, the Java OJAI API Library provides functionality that enables
   you to read the result of your own write operation. See [4]Reading Your
   Own Writes in Java OJAI to learn about how to use this feature in your
   application.
