Developing Applications for Binary Tables

   MapR Database provides a C API, libMapRClient and partially supports
   the Apache HBase 1.1 Java APIs for performing operation on MapR
   Database binary tables.

   The MapR Database C API, libMapRClient, runs more efficiently on MapR
   Database and performs faster against MapR Database tables than the open
   source library of C APIs, libhbase, that is used to create and access
   Apache HBase tables. The libMapRClient header files are in this
   directory: /opt/mapr/include/hbase

   MapR Database also supports all of the Apache HBase 1.1 Java APIs,
   except where noted in this documentation. For a number of critical Java
   APIs, for filters, and for comparators, this documentation explicitly
   lists what is supported, rather than what is not supported.

   You can easily port existing applications that use the open-source
   version of libhbase or the HBase Java APIs to use MapR Database binary
   tables.

Current Limitations

     * Custom HBase filters are not supported.
     * HBase co-processors are not supported.

   Note: Filters used with Scan operations support regular expressions.
   When you filter scans on MapR Database tables, you can use regular
   expressions that comprise the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
   (PCRE) library as well as a subset of the regular expressions that are
   supported in java.util.regex.pattern. See [1]HBase Java Regular
   Expressions Support for a list of supported regular expressions.
