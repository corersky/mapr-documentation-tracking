Migrating between Apache HBase and MapR-DB Binary Tables

   If you were previously using HBase tables on your cluster, prepare your
   cluster to use MapR-DB binary tables in MapR 6.0 or later.

   MapR-DB tables can be parsed by the [1]Apache CopyTable tool
   (org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.CopyTable). You can use the
   CopyTable tool to migrate data from an Apache HBase table to a MapR-DB
   binary table.
