Impersonation via HBase REST Gateway

   Impersonation enables access to tables via user IDs other than the user
   that runs the Gateway.

   You can enable user impersonation to access MapR Database tables via
   the HBase REST Gateway. This feature is not supported in earlier
   combinations of MapR and HBase packages.

   Impersonation is only supported if the REST Gateway is running as the
   mapr user (MAPR_USER).

   You can enable impersonation via the Gateway on both non-secure and
   secure MapR clusters (secured using either MapR SASL or Kerberos). MapR
   Database does not support gateway impersonation using a Thrift
   interface.
   Note: Impersonation for HBase REST Gateway is enabled by default on
   secure clusters.
