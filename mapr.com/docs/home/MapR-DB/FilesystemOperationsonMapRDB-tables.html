Performing Filesystem Operations on MapR Database Tables

   The MapR file system stores tables in the same namespace as files. You
   can move and delete tables in much the same way as you can with files.
   All file system operations remain accessible with the hadoop fs
   command.

   Volume properties, such as replication factor or rack topology, that
   apply to the specified location also apply to tables stored at that
   location. You can move a table with the Linux mv command or the hadoop
   fs -mv command.

   When you use Direct Access NFS or the hadoop fs -ls command to access a
   MapR cluster, tables and files are listed together. Because the
   client's Linux commands are not table-aware, other Linux file
   manipulation commands, notably file read and write commands, are not
   available for MapR Database tables.

   This section describes the operations that you can perform on MapR
   Database tables through a Linux command line when you access the
   cluster through NFS or with the hadoop fs commands.

Setting Permissions

   MapR Database tables do not support setting user permissions through
   the UNIX chmod command or the hadoop fs -chmod analogue. Instead, MapR
   Database table access is controlled with Access Control Expressions
   (ACEs). See [1]Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs.

Read and Write

   You cannot perform read or write operations on a MapR Database table
   from a Linux file system context. For example, you cannot use the cat
   command to view the content of a table or search through a table with
   the grep command. MapR Filesystem returns an error when an application
   attempts to read or write to a MapR Database table.

Move

   You can move a MapR Database table within a volume with the mv command
   over NFS or with the hadoop fs -mv command. These moves are subject to
   the standard permissions restrictions. Moves across volumes are not
   currently supported.

Remove

   You can remove a table with the rm command over NFS or with the hadoop
   fs -rm command. These commands remove the table from the namespace and
   asynchronously reclaims the disk space. You can remove a directory that
   includes both files and tables with the rm -r or hadoop fs -rmr
   commands.
   Note: To prevent users from deleting a particular table, you must
   ensure that users do not have WRITE permission on the folder in which
   the table is located. Permissions on the table itself are not used in
   evaluating whether a user can delete the table. This convention follows
   standard UNIX rules for file and directory permissions.

Copy and Recursive/Directory Copy

   Table copying at the file-system level is not supported. See
   [2]Migrating Between Apache HBase Tables and MapR Database Tables for
   information on copying tables using the HBase shell.
