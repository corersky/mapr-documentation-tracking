mutations.h

   When you use the hb_delete_*() APIs, you must set timestamps to
   INT64_MAX to delete all versions of a column.
   Note: Increment only data that is 8 bytes in length. Before making a
   put to increment a value, your application must convert the new 8-byte
   value to bigendian format with the htobe64 API. When getting an
   incremented value, your application must convert the returned value
   from bigendian format to the original 8-byte value. The application can
   do this with the be64toh API. The need for conversion does not apply to
   increment operations. It applies only to puts that increment values and
   to gets that get incremented values.

   For Windows clients:
     * Use _byteswap_uint64() to convert to a bigendian value before a
       put.
     * Use _byteswap_uint64() to convert from bigendian value to an 8-byte
       value for a get.

   The following is the full mutations.h file for the libMaprClient
   library.
