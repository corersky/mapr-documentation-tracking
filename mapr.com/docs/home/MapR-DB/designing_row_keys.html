Table Rowkey Design

   The design of a table's rowkeys affects the speed at which client
   applications can access data and the database performance if
   hotspotting occurs. The better the design, the faster the data access.

What is a Row Key?

   For binary tables:
          A row key identifies a row in a MapR Database binary table.

   For JSON tables:
          A row key identifies a row in a MapR Database JSON table. You
          specify row keys in the _id field in JSON documents.

          For example, if the value of the _id field in a JSON document is
          user000001, that value is also the rowkey for the row in which
          the JSON document is stored in a JSON table.

Avoiding Hotspotting

   Because records in tables are stored in lexicographical order of their
   rowkeys, using a sequential generation method for rowkeys can lead to a
   hot-spot problem, as illustrated in this diagram. [rowkeys_3b.png] A
   table region reaches a predetermined size and then splits into two
   regions. Because the rowkeys for new records are being created
   sequentially, new rows are added to only one of the new regions. The
   other region is not written to and remains at half of its maximum size.
   The problem is repeated with each subsequent split.

   With MapR Database tables, the cluster handles sequential keys and
   table splits to keep potential hotspots moving across nodes, decreasing
   the intensity and performance impact of hot spots. However, hotspotting
   can still hamper database performance.

   There are two strategies that you can use to avoid hotspotting:

   Hashing keys
          To spread write and insert activity across the cluster, you can
          randomize sequentially generated keys by hashing the keys,
          inverting the byte order. Note that these strategies come with
          trade-offs. Hashing keys, for example, makes table scans for key
          subranges inefficient, since the subrange is spread across the
          cluster.

   Salting keys
          Instead of hashing the key, you can salt the key by prepending a
          few bytes of the hash of the key to the actual key. For a key
          based on a timestamp, for instance, a timestamp value of
          1364248490 has an MD5 hash that ends with ffe5. By making the
          key for that row ffe51364248490, you avoid hotspotting. Because
          you know that the first four digits are a hash salt, you can
          derive the original timestamp by dropping those digits.

Composite Keys

   Each row in a table can have only a single key. You can create
   composite keys to approximate multiple keys in a table. A composite key
   contains several individual IDs joined together, for example userID and
   applicationID. You can then scan for the specific segments of the
   composite row key that represent the original, individual ID.

   Because rows are stored in sorted order, you can affect the results of
   the sort by changing the ordering of the fields that make up the
   composite row key. For example, if your application IDs are generated
   sequentially but your user IDs are not, using a composite key of
   userID+applicationID will store all rows with the same user ID closely
   together. If you know the userID for which you want to retrieve rows,
   you can specify the first userID row and the first userID+1 row as the
   start and stop rows for your scan, then retrieve the rows you're
   interested in without scanning the entire table.

   When designing a composite key, consider how the data will be queried
   during production use. Place the fields that will be queried the most
   often towards the front of the composite key, bearing in mind that
   sequential keys will generate hotspotting.

   For binary tables:
          You must create your own custom logic for working with composite
          keys in applications that use the HBase Java API. This API does
          not have built-in support for composite keys.

   For JSON tables:
          You must create your own custom logic for working with composite
          keys in applications that use the MapR Database OJAI Java API
          library. This API library does not have built-in support for
          composite keys.
