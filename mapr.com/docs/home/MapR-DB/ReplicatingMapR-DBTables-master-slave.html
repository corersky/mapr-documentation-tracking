Master-slave replication

   In this topology, you replicate one way from source tables to replicas.
   The replicas can be in a remote cluster or in the cluster where the
   source tables are located.

   Several different topologies are possible for master-slave replication:

   Replication from one source table to one or more replica tables

   In this topology, updates on a source table are replicated to one or
   more replicas, but updates to the replicas are not replicated back to
   the source table.

   For example, in this diagram updates to the customers table in the
   cluster sanfrancisco are being replicated to the newyork and hyderabad
   clusters. The circles marked G each represent a MapR gateway.

   However, changes to the table in the newyork and hyderabad clusters are
   not replicated back to the table in the sanfrancisco cluster.

   You can also replicate within a single cluster. In this example, the
   cluster sanfrancisco contains both the source table and the replica.

   Many-to-one replication

   Multiple source tables can replicate to a single replica. In this
   diagram, operations on customers tables in three different clusters are
   replicated via gateways to the customers table in the newyork cluster.

   One-to-many replication

   A single source table can replicate to multiple replicas. In this
   diagram, operations on the customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster
   are replicated via gateways to replicas in three other clusters.

   Replication loops

   When three or more tables need to be kept in sync, you can set up
   master-slave replication between pairs of them to form a replication
   loop. Operations on a table are propagated to the other clusters in the
   loop, but there is no attempt to reapply the operations at the
   originating table. This is because the operations are tagged with a
   universally unique identifier (UUID) that identifies the table where
   the operations originated.

   In this diagram, for example, operations on the customers table in the
   hyderabad cluster are replicated first to the customers table in the
   tokyo cluster. The operations are then replicated from the tokyo
   cluster to the customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster. Finally,
   the operations are replicated from the sanfrancisco cluster to the
   customers table in the newyork cluster. The newyork cluster does not
   replicate the operations to the customers table in the hyderabad
   cluster.

   Master-slave replication in two directions

   You can combine master-slave replication configurations to replicate
   data between clusters. Two clusters engaged in replication can each act
   as a source cluster and a destination cluster.

   In this example, the data in the customers table in the cluster
   sanfrancisco is replicated to the customers table in the cluster
   newyork. At the same time, the data in the products table in the
   newyork cluster is replicated to the products table in the cluster
   sanfrancisco.

   In all master-slave configurations, changes made to replica tables are
   not replicated back to source tables. Therefore, if the replicated data
   is modified at the replica by client applications, the replica will
   become out of sync with the source table.

   For example, you might replicate the two column families personal and
   purchases from the customer table in the sanfrancisco cluster to the
   customers table in the newyork cluster, as in this diagram. (For
   simplicity, the blue circle labeled G represents two or more gateways,
   rather than one as in the other diagrams in this topic.)

   In master-slave replication, no updates to a replica are replicated
   back to the source. Any updates that applications might make to those
   two column families in the customers table in the newyork cluster will
   not be replicated to the customers table in the sanfrancisco cluster.

   However, you donâ€™t have to protect a replica from all updates that are
   not due to replication. For example, the customers table in the newyork
   cluster might have an additional column family that is not populated
   with replicated data: reviews.
