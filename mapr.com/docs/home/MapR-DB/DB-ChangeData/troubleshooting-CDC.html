Troubleshooting Changelogs

checkandcreate topic failed with error 17

   I'm getting a checkandcreate topic error while trying to edit a
   changelog topic.
   Because the maprcli table changelog add command is an asynchronous
   command, the CDC relationship (same as replication relationship)
   involves storing information at both the source and destination sides.
   This results in the following behavior:
     * When the maprcli table changelog add operation succeeds, it means
       that the add request is received. To check whether there is an
       error during the add operation, run the maprcli table changelog
       list operation.
     * The maprcli table changelog edit operation only modifies the
       information on the source side, even if an error is display in the
       maprcli table changelog list output, the changelog can still be
       modified.

   Troubleshooting methods:
     * If the stream topic already exists in the destination and you are
       getting an error, delete the topic. The maprcli table changelog add
       operation automatically retries and finishes.
     * If the error can not be fixed, delete the partial relationship from
       the source side with the maprcli table changelog remove operation
       and retry.

Enabling/Disabling Propagation

   Propagation of existing table data is enabled by default. If you do not
   want to propagate existing source table data, set the
   -propagateexistingdata parameter to false. The default is true.

   Propagation is enabled as soon as the table changelog relationship is
   added. If you do not want propagation to begin, set the -pause
   parameter to true. The change data records are stored in a bucket until
   you resume the changelog relationship; at this point, the stored change
   data records are propagated to the stream topic. See [1]table changelog
   resume for more information.
