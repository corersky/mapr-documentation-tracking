Getting Started with CDC

   This topic describes an end-to-end flow of how to establish and use
   Change Data Capture (CDC). It assumes that a new table and dataset will
   be created, although an existing table with data can also be used.

End-to-End Workflow

   To use the Change Data Capture (CDC) feature, the following diagram
   shows an end-to-end workflow.
   Note: Steps 2 and 3 are interchangable. You may decide to start the
   consumer application for CDC changed data records before performing
   CRUD operations on the table.
   [1][USEMAP:cdc-workflow.png]
    1. Setup the CDC environment.
         a. If you are propagating changed data from a source table on a
            source cluster to a destination stream topic on a remote
            destination cluster, a gateway must be setup. Gateways are
            setup by installing the gateway on the destination cluster and
            specifying the gateway node(s) on the source cluster. See
            [2]Administering MapR Gateways and [3]Configuring Gateways for
            Table and Stream Replication.
         b. If you have a secure cluster, secure configuration must be
            setup. See [4]Configuring Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster
            Mirroring and Replication.
         c. Establish a MapR Database table (JSON or binary) with data.
            You can create a new table and add data or use an existing
            table with data. See [5]maprcli table create for creating a
            new table or use the MCS. If you are using an existing table
            with data, skip to the next step.
         d. Create a MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka stream for the
            propagated changed data records using the maprcli stream
            create -ischangelog parameter. See [6]maprcli stream create or
            use the MCS.
         e. Create a MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka stream topic for
            the changed data records. You can use the [7]maprcli stream
            topic create command, the [8]maprcli table changelog add
            command (this command creates a changelog relationsip between
            the source table and the destination stream topic), or the MCS
            when creating either a stream topic or a table changelog.
         f. Create a changelog relationship between the source table and
            the destination stream topic with the [9]maprcli table
            changelog add command or use the MCS. By creating a changelog
            relationship, you are creating an environment that propagates
            changed data records from a source table to a MapR Event Store
            For Apache Kafka topic.
            Note: Propagation of existing table data is enabled by
            default. If you do not want to propagate existing source table
            data, set the -propagateexistingdata parameter to false. The
            default is true.
            Note: Propagation is enabled as soon as the table changelog
            relationship is added. If you do not want propagation to
            begin, set the -pause parameter to true. The change data
            records are stored in a bucket until you resume the changelog
            relationship; at this point, the stored change data records
            are propagated to the stream topic. See [10]table changelog
            resume for more information.
         g. Verify that the changelog exists. See [11]table changelog list
            for information about your changelogs.
    2. Perform CRUD operations (inserts, updates, and deletes) on the
       source table. The following utility and application can be used:
          + [12]mapr dbshell for MapR Database JSON documents
          + [13]hbshell for MapR Database binary data
          + [14]Java applications for MapR Database JSON
          + [15]C or Java applications for MapR Database binary data
    3. Write a consumer with the Apache Kafka and OJAI API libraries that
       subscribes to the topic and consumes the change data records. There
       are multiple interfaces that are used for writing a CDC consumer.
       See [16]Consuming CDC Records for a list of interfaces. See
       [17]Building Consumers for CDC for an example.

Use Cases

   CAPTION: Table 1.

   Scenario Setup Task Notes
   You want a CDC stream topic to contain all of the table data as changed
   data records. You would setup CDC in the following manner before
   performing operations on the source table and consuming the change data
   records.
    1. Create an empty source table.
    2. Create the changelog stream.
    3. Create the changelog stream topic.
    4. Add the table changelog relationship. In this case, it doesn't
       matter if the -propagateexistingdata is set to true or false
       because you're starting with an empty source table.
    5. Verify that the changelog exists and that replicaState is
       REPLICA_STATE_REPLICATING. See [18]table changelog list for more
       information.

   In this case, all table data is propagated to the stream topic as
   change data records and the operation type is identified on each
   individual data record.
   You want a CDC stream topic to contain all of the existing table data
   and changed data records. You would setup CDC in the following manner
   before performing operations on the source table and consuming the
   change data records.
    1. Create a source table and add data, or alternatively, use an
       existing table that contains data.
    2. Create the changelog stream.
    3. Create the changelog stream topic.
    4. Add the table changelog relationship. Be sure that the
       -propagateexistingdata parameter is set to true. If you are using
       the command line to add the changelog, then this parameter does not
       need to be specified because the default is true.
    5. Verify that the changelog exists and no error is reported in the
       changelog list. When all the existing data in the table is
       delivered to the changelog, the replicaState becomes
       REPLICA_STATE_REPLICATING. See [19]table changelog list for more
       information.

   In this case, the existing table data is propagated to the stream topic
   and that data's operation type is identified as a SET operation.
   Subsequently, operations on the source table are propagated as changed
   data records and the operation type is identified on each individual
   data record.

   You can consume data at any time, however, there may be a delay before
   all of the existing table data is completely propagated, expecially if
   you have a large dataset. Be sure to check the
   copyTableCompletionPercentage field.
   You want a CDC stream topic to not contain any original table data and
   to capture only subsequent changed data records You would setup CDC in
   the following manner before performing operations on the source table
   and consuming the change data records.
    1. Create a source table and add data, or alternatively, use an
       existing table that contains data.
    2. Create the changelog stream.
    3. Create the changelog stream topic.
    4. Add the table changelog relationship. Be sure that the
       -propagateexistingdata parameter is set to false.
    5. All new data operations applied to a source table after the
       replicaState becomes REPLICA_STATE_REPLICATING is not treated as
       original data and is delivered to the changelog. See [20]table
       changelog list for more information.

   In this case, the existing table data is not propagated to the stream
   topic and the operation type is identified on each individual data
   record.
