Restrictions for CDC

   The following lists limitations for Change Data Capture:
     * Non-CDC data cannot be propagated to changelog stream topics.
     * Metadata or policy-driven operations are not propagated to
       changelog stream topics; only the changed data. For example, since
       column family and time-to-live (TTL) is metadata, they are not
       propagated to changelog stream topics. If metadata is changed in
       the source table, that information is unknown in relation to the
       destination stream topic data.
     * Propagation of MapR Database JSON arrays is expensive because the
       full array is propagated to the changelog stream topic.
