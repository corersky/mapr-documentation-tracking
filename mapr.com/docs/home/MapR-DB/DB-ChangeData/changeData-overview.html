Change Data Capture

   The Change Data Capture (CDC) system allows you to capture changes made
   to data records in MapR Database tables (JSON or binary) and propagate
   them to a MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka topic.

   These data changes are the result of inserts, updates, and deletions
   and are called change data records. Once the change data records are
   propagated to a topic, a MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka/Kafka
   consumer application is used to read and process them.
   Note: The order of the records in the topic-partition is the same as
   the order of the changes made to the table. The order is retained
   because change data records for the same key are propagated to the same
   topic-partition.

Why Use Change Data Capture?

   CDC can be used in many ways, including the following:
     * To track changes occuring in a MapR Database table and perform
       real-time processing on the data.
     * To keep caches for search indexes (such as Elastic Search, Solr),
       materialized views, synchronization between data warehouses or data
       marts with data stored in MapR Database in real time.
     * To manage separate MapR Database instances for transactional and
       reporting purposes and to keep them in sync in real time for real
       time analytics.
     * To provide arbitrary external systems the ability to globally
       consume MapR Database table changes.

How Do I Get Started?

   The following topics provide information you need to understand the CDC
   feature, to setup and use CDC, the maprcli commands used to perform
   tasks, and to consume the data via your application.
