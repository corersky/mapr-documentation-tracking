Change Data Capture

   The Change Data Capture (CDC) system allows you to capture changes made
   to data records in MapR-DB tables (JSON or binary) and propagate them
   to a MapR-ES topic. These data changes are the result of inserts,
   updates, and deletions and are called change data records. Once the
   change data records are propagated to a topic, a MapR-ES/Kafka consumer
   application is used to read and process them.

Why Use Change Data Capture?

   CDC can be used in many ways, including the following:
     * To track changes occuring in a MapR-DB table and perform real-time
       processing on the data.
     * To keep caches for search indexes (such as Elastic Search, Solr),
       materialized views, synchronization between data warehouses or data
       marts with data stored in MapR-DB in real time.
     * To manage separate MapR-DB instances for transactional and
       reporting purposes and to keep them in sync in real time for real
       time analytics.
     * To provide arbitrary external systems the ability to globally
       consume MapR-DB table changes.

How Do I Get Started?

   The following topics provide information you need to understand the CDC
   feature, to setup and use CDC, the maprcli commands used to perform
   tasks, and to consume the data via your application.
