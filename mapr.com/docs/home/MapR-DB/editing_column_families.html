Altering Column Families

   There are several methods that you can use to edit column families in
   MapR-DB tables. These methods also let you change permissions on column
   families.

Modifying a Column Family Using the MapR Control System

    1. Go to the table information page.
       See [1]Viewing Table Information.
    2. Click Column Families tab.
       The page displays:
          + Default column family permissions
          + All the column families for the table
    3. Click the name of the column family to modify.
       The Edit Column Family page displays.
    4. Make changes to the following properties (under PROPERTIES) as
       desired.
          + [2]JSON Table
          + [3]Binary Table

   Column Family Name The name of the column family.
   Compression The compression setting to use for the column family. Valid
   options are off, lzf, lz4, and zlib. The default setting is the same as
   the compression setting for the directory where the table is located.
   To find out whether a directory is compressed and the type of
   compression, see [4]Turning Compression On or Off on Directories Using
   the CLI.
   In Memory Determines whether preference is given to values of this
   column family for storage with row keys. Because row keys are cached in
   memory in preference to row data, column-family data that is stored
   inline with the row keys is also cached in memory.

   For all column families in a table together, up to 200 bytes of row
   data will be stored inline with each row key. Storing data inline with
   a row key might speed retrieval of the data from a column family
   because disk access can often be avoided. For each column family, up to
   32 bytes can be stored inline with each row key even if this is
   disabled (No), but preference will be given to column families where
   this is enabled (Yes). A column family can have more than 32 bytes
   stored inline if this is enabled.
   If the total number of bytes for all column families together exceeds
   200 for a row, then preference for inclusion within the inline storage
   for that row is given to column families that have this enabled.
   Note: All of the data for a column family will be stored in-line with
   the row key, or none will be. If the contents in a column family for a
   particular row are larger than the maximum number of bytes that are
   allowed to be stored for that column family, no data will be stored
   in-line for that column family.
   By default, this is enabled.

   Column Family Name The name of the column family.
   Version
          + Minimum — The minimum number of versions of column values to
            keep. The default is zero.
          + Maximum — Maximum number of versions of column values to keep.
            The default is one.

   Compression The compression setting to use for the column family. Valid
   options are off, lzf, lz4, and zlib. The default setting is the same as
   the compression setting for the directory where the table is located.
   To find out whether a directory is compressed and the type of
   compression, see [5]Turning Compression On or Off on Directories Using
   the CLI.
   Time-to-Live Specifies whether to purge data when the age of the data
   in this column family exceeds the value specified here. Data can remain
   forever or can be purged after specified amount of time (in seconds).
   Setting the value to 0 is equivalent to allowing data to remain
   indefinitely or forever.
   In Memory Determines whether preference is given to values of this
   column family for storage with row keys. Because row keys are cached in
   memory in preference to row data, column-family data that is stored
   inline with the row keys is also cached in memory.

   For all column families in a table together, up to 200 bytes of row
   data will be stored inline with each row key. Storing data inline with
   a row key might speed retrieval of the data from a column family
   because disk access can often be avoided. For each column family, up to
   32 bytes can be stored inline with each row key even if this is
   disabled (No), but preference will be given to column families where
   this is enabled (Yes). A column family can have more than 32 bytes
   stored inline if this is enabled.
   If the total number of bytes for all column families together exceeds
   200 for a row, then preference for inclusion within the inline storage
   for that row is given to column families that have this enabled.
   Note: All of the data for a column family will be stored in-line with
   the row key, or none will be. If the contents in a column family for a
   particular row are larger than the maximum number of bytes that are
   allowed to be stored for that column family, no data will be stored
   in-line for that column family.
   By default, this is enabled.
    5. Make changes to permissions as desired.
         a. Modify USER ACCESS CONTROLs for the column family as desired.
               o [6]JSON Table
               o [7]Binary Table
            Modify or set the following permissions for the column family:

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Traverse Data Can pass over fields in JSON documents. For example,
   suppose that a JSON table contains documents of this general structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" : "value",
               "c" : "value"
          }
}

   Suppose further that the user sjohnson has read permission on a.b, but
   not on a. For sjohnson to read a.b, the user needs the traverse
   permission on a. The user can then pass over field a to a.b. This
   permission is inherited by fields within the column family.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.
            Modify or set the following permissions for the column family:

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Append Data Can do column appends. Column appends require permission
   both at the column-family level and at the column level.
   Set Version Can set or change the maximum and minimum number of
   versions of column values to keep.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.
         b. Modify or set:
               o [8]Field Permission (for JSON Tables)
               o [9]Column Permission (for Binary Tables)
            Modify permissions for the following on existing fields and/or
            create new fields and set permissions for the following on the
            new fields:

   Read Data Can read from the field. This permission extends to fields
   that are nested below as well unless explicitly denied on any of the
   nested fields.
   Write Data Can delete the field, insert a value into the field, or
   overwrite the field's value.

   Note: Deleting a field also deletes all fields that are nested within
   that field, even those fields on which the write permission is
   explicitly denied.
   JSON Traverse Can descend a hierarchy of fields to access the fields to
   read or write.
            Modify following permissions for existing columns and/or
            create new columns and set permissions for the following:

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Append Data Can do column appends. Column appends require permission
   both at the column-family level and at the column level.
       To grant or block access to users, groups, and/or roles, from the:
          + Basic settings, select the type — public, (OR) user, group, or
            role — from the drop-down menu, specify the name of the user,
            group, or role, and select one or more checkbox to grant
            permissions.
            Tip: Click [cloneACE.png] to create a copy of the associated
            access control setting. Click [deleteRow.png] to remove the
            associated access control expression.
            To add access control expressions for another user, group, or
            role, click Add Another and repeat this step.
          + Advanced settings, or specify public (p) or user (u), group
            (g), and/or role (r) who have and/or do not have the type of
            access using the following boolean expressions and
            subexpressions:
               o ! — Negation operator.
               o & — AND operation.
               o | — OR operation.
            Use (), parentheses, for subexpressions.
            Note: You cannot specify user, group, or role individually if
            access is granted to all users (public).
            Alternatively, click [editPencil.png] associated with the type
            of access to use the Access Control Expression window to
            define access for public or users, group, and/or role. See
            [10]Defining ACEs for more information.
       Note: If you switch from Basic to Advanced, the basic settings, if
       any, will be carried over to the advanced settings. If you switch
       from Advanced to Basic, all the settings will be lost because the
       subexpressions and AND (&) and negation (!) operations that are
       supported by advanced settings are not supported in the basic
       settings.
    6. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

Modifying a Column Family Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to edit a column family is:
maprcli table cf edit -path <path> -cfname <name_of_column_family> options

   For the full list of options for this command, see [11]table cf edit.

   The format of the value of the -path parameter depends on whether you
   are creating a table on a local cluster or a remote cluster:
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

Modifying a Column Family in a Binary Table Using HBase shell

   After starting the HBase shell, run the alter command. Type help to see
   a list of commands and their syntax.
