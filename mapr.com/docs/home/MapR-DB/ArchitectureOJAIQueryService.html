OJAI Distributed Query Service

   OJAI queries either directly access MapR-DB JSON or leverage the OJAI
   Distributed Query Service. The OJAI Distributed Query Service provides
   distributed query support for MapR-DB JSON, powered by Apache Drill.
   The MapR client automatically determines whether OJAI queries benefit
   from using the OJAI Distributed Query Service, when the service is
   available. This section describes the architecture, including the code
   paths and components involved. It also discusses queries that originate
   from Drill SQL, which leverage the full functionality of MapR Drill.

   The following diagram summarizes the different code paths and the
   components involved for processing MapR-DB JSON queries.

   MapR automatically chooses which code path to use.

   The following table summarizes the functionality each code path
   supports:
   Simple OJAI Queries OJAI Queries Requiring OJAI Distributed Query
   Service Analytical Drill Queries
     * Can use single secondary index
     * Configurable limit on sorts
     * Serial query execution

     * Can use multiple secondary indexes
     * No imposed limit on sort size
     * Parallel query execution
     * Query optimization for operational queries

     * Can use multiple secondary indexes
     * No imposed limit on sort size
     * Parallel query execution
     * Query optimization for analytical queries

   Simple OJAI Queries
          The right path in the image above represents simple queries
          issued through an OJAI application. These queries can leverage a
          single index and operate on smaller data sets that do not
          benefit from parallel query execution.

          Queries in this code path do not use the OJAI Distributed Query
          Service. If the OJAI Distributed Query Service is not installed,
          all OJAI queries use this code path. When queries run through
          this code path, sorts on large data sets may fail if the result
          size exceeds the size of a configurable parameter. See
          [1]Querying in OJAI Applications for more details.

   OJAI Queries Requiring OJAI Distributed Query Service
          The middle path represents more complex queries issued through
          an OJAI application. These queries use the enhanced
          functionality available in the OJAI Distributed Query Service.
          This includes sorting large data sets and distributed, parallel
          query execution. When the Distributed Query Service is
          installed, the MapR client decides whether a query benefits from
          the service and automatically redirects the query to the
          service.

          The OJAI Distributed Query Service is a lightweight subset of
          the full Drill query engine that is well suited for the typical
          queries issued by OJAI. It excludes the more advanced
          functionality needed by analytical queries.

          The OJAI Distributed Query Service also provides more
          sophisticated index selection, including leveraging multiple
          indexes in a single query. It uses a cost based optimizer to
          select the indexes that provide the best performance.

   Analytical Drill Queries
          The left path represents SQL queries issued by BI and SQL tools
          to Drill. This path leverages Drillâ€™s analytical capabilities.
          It can optimize and process complex queries on large data sets
          in parallel and provide interactive query response times.

          The optimizer used by Drill is a superset of the optimizer used
          by the OJAI Distributed Query Service. It is also a cost based
          optimizer, but includes more comprehensive optimization
          techniques needed by complex analytical queries.

   For more information about how secondary index selection and execution
   works in MapR-DB JSON, see [2]Selection and Execution of Secondary
   Indexes.
   Note: Prior to MapR version 6.0.1, the OJAI Distributed Query Service
   was named the OJAI Query Service.
