Multi-Tenancy

   Since MapR-DB tables are created in volumes, when you restrict the
   volume, you also restrict the table data. If a volume is restricted to
   a subset of a cluster's nodes, then it allows you order to isolate
   sensitive data or applications, and even use heterogeneous hardware in
   the cluster for specific workloads.

   For example, you can use data placement to keep personally identifiable
   information on nodes that have encrypted drives, or to keep MapR-DB
   tables on nodes that have SSDs. You can also isolate work environments
   for different database users or applications and place MapR-DB tables
   on specific hardware for better performance or load isolation

   Isolation of work environments for different database users or
   applications lets you set policies, quotas, and access privileges at
   for specific users and volumes. You can run multiple jobs with
   different requirements without conflict.

   As an example, the diagram below depicts a MapR cluster storing table
   and file data. The cluster has three separate volumes mounted at
   directories /user/john, /user/dave, and /project/ads. As shown, each
   directory contains both file data and table data, grouped together
   logically. Because each of these directories maps to a different
   volume, data in each directory can have different policy. For example,
   /user/john has a disk-usage quota, while /user/dave is on a snapshot
   schedule. Furthermore, two directories, /user/john and /project/ads are
   mirrored to locations outside the cluster, providing read-only access
   to high-traffic data, including the tables in those volumes.

   Example: Restricting table storage with quotas and physical topology
   This example creates a table with disk usage quota of 100GB restricted
   to certain data nodes in the cluster. First, we create a volume named
   project-tables-vol, specifying the quota and restricting storage to
   nodes in the /data/rack1 topology, and mounting it in the local
   namespace. Next, we use the HBase shell to create a new table named
   datastore, specifying a path inside the project-tables-vol volume.
$ pwd
/mapr/cluster1/user/project

$ls
bin   src

$ maprcli volume create -name project-tables-vol -path /user/project/tables \
    -quota 100G -topology /data/rack1

$ ls
bin   src   tables

$ hbase shell
HBase Shell; enter 'help<RETURN>' for list of supported commands.
Type "exit<RETURN>" to leave the HBase Shell
