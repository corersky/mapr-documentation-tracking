Table Replication

   Data in one table can be replicated to another table that is in the
   same cluster or in a separate cluster. This type of replication is in
   addition to the automatic replication that occurs with table regions
   within a volume.

   You can replicate changes (puts and deletes), entire tables, specific
   column families, and specific columns.
   Note: MapR binary tables can only be replicated to binary tables; MapR
   JSON tables can only be replicated to JSON tables.
     * Tables that data is replicated from are called source tables, while
       tables that data is replicated to are called replicas.
     * Clusters that data is replicated from are called source clusters.
       Clusters that data is replicated to are called destination
       clusters. A single cluster can be both a source cluster and a
       destination cluster, depending on the replication configuration in
       which the cluster participates.
     * Replication takes place between source and destination clusters.
       However, source clusters do not send data to nodes in the
       destination cluster directly. The replication stream (the data
       being pushed to the replicas) is consumed by one or more MapR
       gateways in the destination cluster. The gateways receive the
       updates from the source cluster, batch them, and apply them to the
       replica tables. Multiple gateways serve the purpose of both load
       balancing and failover.

   Gateways.
   Note: The maximum number of replicas that a source table can replicate
   to is 64. The maximum number of source tables that a replica can accept
   updates from is 64.
