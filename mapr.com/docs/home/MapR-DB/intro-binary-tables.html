MapR-DB Binary Tables

   MapR-DB stores structured data as a nested series of maps. Each map
   consists of a set of key-value pairs, where the value can be the key in
   another map.

   MapR-DB stores structured data as a nested series of maps. Each map
   consists of a set of key-value pairs, where the value can be the key in
   another map. Keys are kept in strict lexicographical order: 1, 10, and
   113 come before 2, 20, and 213.

   In descending order of granularity, the elements of a binary table are:
     * Key: Keys identify the rows in a table. In MapR-DB, the maximum
       supported size of a row key is 64 KB. However, the recommended
       practice is to keep it lower than a few hundred bytes.
     * Row: Rows span one or more column families and columns. In MapR-DB,
       the maximum supported size of a row is 2 GB. However, the
       recommended practice is to keep the size under 2 MB. In general,
       MapR-DB performs better with many small rows, rather than with
       fewer very large rows.
     * Column family: A column family is a key associated with a set of
       columns. Specify this association according to your individual use
       case, creating sets of columns. A column family can contain an
       arbitrary number of columns. MapR-DB binary tables support up to 64
       column families.
     * Column: Columns are keys that are associated with a series of
       timestamps that define when the value in that column was updated.
     * Timestamp: The timestamp in a column specifies a particular data
       write to that column.
     * Value: The data written to that column at the specific timestamp.

   This structure results in versioned values that you can access flexibly
   and quickly. Because MapR-DB binary tables are sparse, any of the
   column values for a given key can be null.

Example Table

   This example uses JSON notation for representational clarity. In this
   example, timestamps are arbitrarily assigned.

   Queries return the most recent timestamp by default. For example, a
   query for the value in
   "arbitrarySecondKey"/"secondColumnFamily:firstColumn" returns
   valueThree. Specifying a timestamp with a query for
   "arbitrarySecondKey"/"secondColumnFamily:firstColumn"/11 returns
   valueSeven.
