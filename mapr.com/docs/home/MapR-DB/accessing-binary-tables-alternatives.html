Accessing MapR-DB Binary Tables Using HBase APIs

   This section discusses how to access MapR-DB binary tables via HBase
   APIs, HBase Shell, and MapReduce applications.

   MapR has extended the HBase component to handle access to MapR-DB
   binary tables. MapR-DB binary tables do not support low-level HBase API
   calls that are used to manipulate the state of an Apache HBase cluster.

   See [1]Creating Java Apps - Binary Tables for a full list of supported
   HBase Java APIs.

   See [2]HBase Shell for MapR-DB for a full list of supported commands in
   the HBase shell.

   To enable the HBase API and hbase shell access, install the mapr-hbase
   package on every node in the cluster. The HBase component of the MapR
   distribution for Hadoop is typically installed under/opt/mapr/hbase.
   Install the mapr-hbase package that provides the version that
   corresponds with the current MEP and MapR version you are running.

   See the [3]Installing MapR and/or MapR Ecosystem Components for
   information about MapR installation procedures.
   Note: The version of HBase provided by MapR has been modified to work
   with MapR-DB binary tables. Do not download and install stock Apache
   HBase on a MapR cluster that uses MapR tables.
   Note: If you use fat JARs to deploy your application as a single JAR
   including all dependencies, be aware that the fat JAR may contain
   versions of HBase that override the installed MapR versions, leading to
   problems. Check your fat JARs for the presence of stock HBase to
   prevent this problem.
