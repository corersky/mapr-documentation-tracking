MapR Installer Known Issues

   This topic describes some MapR Installer known issues that you should
   be aware of while troubleshooting.
   Issue Description
   IN-2065 /mapr sometimes does not get mounted after you enable NFS (v3
   or v4) using the MapR Installer Incremental Install function. The
   Incremental Install function is an online operation. Enabling NFS using
   an Incremental Install can create a race condition between when the
   mapr_fstab file gets created and NFS is started by Warden. If NFS is
   started by Warden before the mapr_fstab file is created, /mapr does not
   get mounted.

   Workaround If /mapr is not mounted, check the time stamp of the
   /opt/mapr/conf/mapr_fstab file to see if it is older than the time
   stamp in the warden.log file for starting NFS. For example:
[root@atsqa4-61 logs]# ls -ld /opt/mapr/conf/fstab
rw-rr- 1 mapr mapr 39 Sep 26 11:31 /opt/mapr/conf/mapr_fstab

[root@atsqa4-61 logs]# fgrep starting warden.log | fgrep nfs
2018-09-26 11:29:33,407 INFO com.mapr.warden.service.baseservice.Service [Thread
-34]: -------------Service is starting for: nfs4

   If the time stamp of the mapr_fstab file is older than the Warden time
   stamp:
    1. Restart the NFS service:
maprcli node services -nodes <node names> -nfs4 start
    2. Run the mount_local_fs.pl script to mount /mapr:
/opt/mapr/bin/mount_local_fs.pl

   INFO-420 The procedure for [1]Configuring Storage on a Node using
   disksetup does not work for new installations of DARE-enabled MapR 6.1
   clusters. With [2]DARE enabled, disksetup fails on any node that is not
   a CLDB node because there is no local copy of the dare.master.key file.
   When you use disksetup, non-CLDB nodes try to contact the CLDB, which
   must be running when the nodes attempt contact.
   Workaround After running configure.sh, you must:
    1. Format the disks on the CLDB nodes.
    2. Start ZooKeeper on the ZooKeeper nodes.
    3. Start Warden on the CLDB nodes.
    4. Format the remaining node disks using disksetup.
    5. Start Warden on the remaining nodes.

   IN-2061 A fresh install of MapR 6.0.0 using the sample_advanced.yaml
   file for MapR Installer Stanzas (Installer version 1.9) can fail with
   the following error message:
ERROR: install command failed
Service mapr-data-access-gateway must be a member of a template group. Configure
d services require it: ['mapr-data-access-gateway']

   The error is generated because the .yaml file is missing an entry for
   the mapr-data-access-gateway in the MASTER services section. The
   mapr-data-access-gateway service is needed for MapR-DB installations.

   Workaround In the MASTER services section of the sample_advanced.yaml
   file, add mapr-data-access-gateway to at least one of the host groups,
   and retry the installation.
   IN-1272 During an upgrade to MapR 6.0 or later (Drill 1.11),
   configure.sh sometimes fails to disable the storage plugin for HBase.
   The HBase server is not supported in MapR Core 6.0 or later, so the
   HBase storage plugin should be disabled before a cluster is upgraded to
   MapR 6.0 or later. Otherwise, Drill queries against HBase will hang.
   Workaround Before upgrading to Drill 1.11 or later, manually disable
   the HBase storage plug-in. To manually disable the plug-in, you can use
   the Drill Web Console or Drill REST API commands. You can disable the
   HBase storage plugin on the Storage page of the Drill Web Console at
   http(s)://<drill-hostname>:8047. For more information, see this page:
https://drill.apache.org/docs/rest-api-introduction/#delete-/storage/{name}.json

   IN-1747 If you use the MapR Installer 1.10 Uninstall button to
   uninstall MapR software and a node is unreachable, you will not be able
   to uninstall the node later when the node is reachable.

   Workaround Uninstall the MapR software on the node manually. See
   [3]Decommissioning a Node and Uninstalling MapR Software from the
   Command-line.
   IN-2015 A fresh install of MapR 6.0.0 with MEP 4.1.1 using MapR
   Installer 1.9 can fail with the following error message:
file not found: /opt/mapr/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.4.1/etc/elasticsearch/sg
/admin-usr-clientCombo.pem

   Workaround [4]Update the installer to version 1.10 or later, and retry
   the operation.
   IN-2018 Logging on to Kibana results in an authentication failure. This
   can happen on a CentOS cluster if you use MapR Installer 1.10 to
   install MapR 6.0.1 MEP 5.0.0, and then upgrade to MapR 6.1.0 and MEP
   6.0.0.

   Workaround Try using Mapr Installer 1.9 to install the MapR 6.0.1
   cluster and MapR Installer 1.10 to upgrade the cluster. See [5]Updating
   the MapR Installer.
   CORE-150 After using the Incremental Install function of the MapR
   Installer to apply security to an Azure-based MapR 6.1.0 cluster, the
   Hue and Spark-thrift server links are not accessible in the Installer
   interface. This issue can occur on an Azure-provisioned cluster whose
   internal DNS suffix starts with a number rather than a letter.

   Workaround Re-create the cluster in Azure so that the internal DNS
   suffix starts with a letter and not a number.
   IN-2025 The Extend Cluster operation can fail during the Verify Nodes
   phase with an error indicating Unscalable host groups found. This error
   can occur when the MASTER group is missing or a single-instance service
   (for example, Grafana) has been moved out of the MASTER group. The
   mapr-installer.log reveals which MapR services are supposed to be in
   the MASTER group.

   Workaround Move any original MASTER services that caused the error back
   to the MASTER group. The mapr-installer.log indicates the services that
   need to be moved along with the Unscalable host groups found error.
   IN-2006 On a cluster with mapr-drill installed, the probe command can
   return the wrong database type value.
   Workaround After using the probe command, check to see if the resulting
   YAML file has the correct mapr_db setting. Possible settings are:
     * QS
     * DRILL
     * DRILLQS

   If necessary, change the setting in the YAML file to match the value
   from the probed cluster.
   IN-1955 If you install MapR software using the MapR Installer in a
   browser and then upgrade the MapR installer in the same browser tab and
   attempt an upgrade without starting a new browser, the stale browser
   cache can cause upgrade errors.

   Workaround Clear your browser cache or open a new browser tab whenever
   you need to update the MapR Installer and perform a new installer
   operation.
   IN-1983 After an upgrade from MapR 5.x to MapR 6.1 and MEP 6.0.0 using
   the MapR Installer, the kafka-connect service fails to start. This
   issue has been noticed on platforms that use systemd.

   Workaround Stop the kafka-connect service manually, and restart the
   service.
   IN-1972 During an upgrade from MapR 5.x to MapR 6.1, the MapR Installer
   prompts you for the MySQL user ID and password. If you enter a password
   that is different from the password you provided when you originally
   configured MySQL through the MapR Installer, the upgrade fails with
   this error: "Unable to connect to database.…"

   Workaround When the MapR Installer prompts you for the MySQL user ID
   and password, enter the password that you specified when you first
   installed the cluster. If you did not specify a password for MySQL when
   you installed MapR 5.x, leave the password field blank.
   IN-1904 If you initiate a system startup by clicking the Startup button
   on the MapR Installer web interface, the Authentication screen is
   displayed. If you subsequently click the Previous button, the following
   buttons are shown as active even though they are not usable during
   system startup:
     * Extend Cluster
     * Incremental Install
     * Maintenance Update
     * Shutdown
     * Uninstall

   Workaround: Do not use the Previous button during startup.
   IN-1657 After [6]updating MapR Installer 1.7 or later, the Installer
   can lose awareness that a cluster was previously installed. For
   example, the MapR Installer might indicate the need for a fresh
   install.
   Workaround: If this happens, do NOT proceed with installation or
   upgrade operations. Follow these steps to reset the cluster state:
    1. Click Support > Reset Installer. A warning screen appears.
    2. Click OK.
    3. Click Support > Import State.
    4. Click Reset to recover the cluster to the last known state. It is
       safe to use the MapR Installer at this point.

   IN-1084 For MapR 6.0 or later clusters, enabling security by using the
   [7]Incremental Install function can overwrite custom certificates in
   the ssl_truststore and ssl_keystore files. When you turn on security,
   the MapR Installer runs the configure.sh script on the CLDB master node
   to generate security keys and then distributes the keys to all the
   other CLDB nodes. The installer also distributes certificates to all
   the other nodes. This process can cause custom certificates to be
   overwritten. However, before enabling security, the MapR Installer
   makes a backup of the exisiting ssl_keystore and ssl_truststore files.
   Workaround: After enabling security, locate the backup of the
   ssl_keystore and ssl_truststore files. The backup uses this format:
/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore.sv.<timestamp>

   Extract any custom certificates from the backup files, and manually
   merge or add them into the new ssl_keystore and ssl_truststore files.

   To merge the files, you can use the /opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh
   utility, as shown in [8]Configuring Secure Clusters for Running
   Commands Remotely.
   IN-997 When using MapR Installer 1.9 with Ubuntu distributions, an
   upgrade of the MapR Installer definitions requires a restart of the
   installer service. The restart is needed because the MapR Installer
   services version is not updated properly when you use either of the
   following commands:
     * mapr-setup.sh reload
     * apt-get install mapr-installer-definitions

   Workaround: After installing or reloading the MapR Installer
   definitions, issue one of these commands to fix the services version:
     * service mapr-installer restart
     * systemctl restart mapr-installer

   IN-1671 For MapR Installer 1.8 and earlier, installation on Ubuntu
   16.04 can fail if Python 2 is not available or if the default is set to
   Python 3. The installer requires python and python-yaml to be installed
   on all nodes.
   Workaround: To install the Python packages manually:
sudo apt-get install python python-yaml -y

   IN-1336 The MapR Installer Retry function can be affected if the
   installer operation fails. Suppose you deselect a service during an
   Incremental Install operation. If the Incremental Install fails and you
   need to Retry, it's possible that the service will not be deselected
   (uninstalled).
   Workaround: Manually remove (uninstall) the service by using one of
   these commands:
     * Red Hat / CentOS: yum remove
     * Ubuntu: apt-get remove
     * SUSE: zypper remove

   IN-1392 During an Extend Cluster (add node) operation using the MapR
   Installer, if installation of the added node fails and you abort the
   operation, the installer can display the added node even though it did
   not get installed.

   Workaround: When the MapR Installer indicates that a node did not get
   added correctly (typically during the Installation phase), select the
   node and click Remove Node. Then retry adding the node.
   IN-1396 An installation using the MapR Installer fails with the
   following Ansible module error:
nValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

   Workaround: Check for syntax errors in the /etc/sysctl.conf file, which
   can cause an Ansible error when the MapR Installer is attempting to set
   various kernel parameters.
   IN-1398 In the MapR Installer Verify Nodes page, if you click a host,
   the Disks Selected for MapR box in the right pane displays the disks
   that were specified for the host either manually or automatically. If
   you deselect a disk in the right pane and click Retry, the deselection
   is not always implemented.

   Workaround: Click Previous to go back to the Node Configuration page,
   and re-specify the disks that you want. Then continue with the
   operation.
   IN-1386 On a secure MapR cluster, YARN jobs can fail if you specify IP
   addresses rather than host names when you configure nodes using the
   MapR Installer.

   Workaround: Do not use an IP address for node configuration with the
   MapR Installer. If you already used an IP address, change the IP
   address in the [9]yarn-site.xml file on all nodes. In the following
   example, the 10.10.10.7 IP address must be changed to a host name, such
   as bld73.qa.lab:
<property>
<name>yarn.timeline-service.hostname</name>
<value>10.10.10.73</value>
</property>

   IN-1333 On Ubuntu clusters, the mapr-setup.sh script fails to reload
   the MapR Installer definitions during an update of the MapR installer
   and definitions.
   Workaround: After updating, restart the installer to load the
   definitions:
service mapr-installer restart

   IN-907 The MapR Installer service fails if the mapr user or root user
   already exist and they are configured to use a shell other than bash.
   For more information about user requirements, see the [10]MapR
   Installer Prerequisites and Guidelines.
   IN-1079 Verification fails when the installed language pack is for a
   language other than English.
   Workaround: Remove the non-English language pack and install the
   English language pack. In the following example, the non-English
   language pack is shown as German. Also, make sure your system locale is
   set to en_us, as described in [11]Infrastructure.
sudo apt-get install language-pack-en language-pack-en-base manpages
sudo apt-get remove language-pack-de language-pack-de-base manpages-de

   IN-804 Using the Incremental Install operation to add a third node to a
   CONTROL group generates an error: ERROR: configure_refresh.sh failed.
   This issue applies to MapR Installer versions 1.6 and earlier.

   Workaround: Update the MapR Installer to version 1.7 or later, and
   retry the operation. See [12]Updating the MapR Installer.
   IN-1314 When you use the MapR Installer to install ecosystem components
   that require a MySQL component such as Hive, Oozie, or Hue, the
   passwords you provide to install the MySQL database are displayed in
   the mapr-installer.log and <nodename>.log files. Beginning with MapR
   Installer 1.7, the permissions for the mapr-installer.log and
   <nodename>.log files are changed so that these passwords are not world
   readable. However, the passwords are still present in log files created
   with earlier versions of the MapR Installer.

   Workaround: For increased security, remove the earlier logs or change
   the user permissions for them.
   IN-646 An upgrade using the MapR Installer can fail if ansible
   processes hang. Performing a service mapr-installer restart does not
   help. The installer-process.log indicates Lock file
   /opt/mapr/installer/data/mapr-installer.lock exists.
   IN-1042 Installation of the 5.2.x mapr-metrics package on SUSE 12 SP2
   fails because the libmysqulclient16 package is not present. This can
   happen when mapr-metrics is installed manually or using the MapR
   Installer. This issue was detected during installations of MapR 5.2.x
   with MEP 3.0.0.

   Workaround: None.
   IN-870 If your cluster uses 2-digit MEPs, and you use the MapR
   Installer [13]Extend Cluster button to add a node, the node can be
   added with a patch version that is different from the patch version of
   other nodes in the cluster. See [14]Understanding Two-Digit and
   Three-Digit MEPs.

   A one-time change can prevent this issue. After updating the MapR
   Installer from version 1.5 to version 1.6 or later, but before
   performing any MapR Installer operations, use an [15]Incremental
   Install to change your 2-digit MEP version to the equivalent 3-digit
   MEP version. See [16]Updating the MapR Installer.
   ES-27, IN‑1387 On a new installation of a secure cluster using the MapR
   Installer, Elasticsearch fails to start, and logs indicate that
   Elasticsearch key generation failed. When this happens, Kibana and
   Fluentd also do not start. The MapR Installer allows the installation
   to complete.

   Workaround: Check the installer log for a message indicating that
   Elasticsearch could not be secured. Use the Incremental Install feature
   of the MapR Installer to retry installation of the MapR Monitoring
   logging components. Alternatively, you can configure security for the
   logging components manually. See [17]Step 9: Install Log Monitoring.
   IN-1332 On clusters with less than the recommended memory configuration
   (16 GB per node), services added during an [18]Incremental Install
   operation might fail to start because Warden allocated available memory
   to the MapR file system. The MapR Installer might not indicate a
   problem with the newly added services. If this issue occurs, the MapR
   file system cannot relinquish memory without restarting Warden.
   Note: This issue can also occur on clusters with more than 16 GB of
   memory per node if the installed services require more memory than is
   currently installed.

   Workaround: Use MCS or the maprcli service list -node command to
   determine if the added services are running. If not, perform a rolling
   restart of the nodes to which the new services were added. The rolling
   restart will rebalance memory across the file system and services. One
   node at a time, restart Warden on each node following the group upgrade
   order prescribed in [19]Manual Rolling Upgrade Description. Use the
   following steps:
    1. Change to the root user (or use sudo for the following commands).
    2. Stop Warden.
sudo service mapr-warden stop
    3. Restart Warden.
service mapr-warden start

   IN-1339 Installation fails with the MapR Installer reporting an
   Unexpected failure during module execution, and the following entry is
   present in the [20]Logs for the MapR Installer:
os.write(self.sshpass_pipe[1], to_bytes(self._play_context.password) + b'\n')
OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

   Workaround:
   Change the ssh settings as described in known issue IN-405 later on
   this page, and retry the installation.
   IN-553 New installations on Ubuntu 14.04 using MapR Installer 1.6 or
   1.7 can fail because of a JDK 1.8 issue.

   Workaround: If you are installing on Ubuntu 14.04, you must install
   Java JDK 1.8 before running the MapR Installer. For more information,
   see [21]this website. If you are installing on RHEL/CentOS or SUSE, the
   MapR Installer installs Java JDK 1.8 for you.
   IN-405 MapR installation or [22]cluster import fails with the error
   message: "Failed to resolve remote temporary directory from
   ansible-tmp- ...."

   Workaround: To proceed using the MapR Installer, disable SSH connection
   reuse by including this entry underneath the [ssh_connection] property
   of /opt/mapr/installer/etc/ansible.cfg:
ssh_args=-o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -o ControlPersist=no

   This workaround can lead to longer install times. We recommend that you
   resolve any network connectivity issues in your environment.
   IN-250 An upgrade to a new MapR core version and a new MEP using the
   MapR Installer can fail if the cluster being upgraded was initially
   installed with Hive Metastore but not with Hive. The Hive Metastore
   package has an installation dependency on Hive, but the Hive Metastore
   definitions do not enforce the dependency, resulting in inconsistencies
   in the installer database. This issue has been observed on Ubuntu
   platforms.

   Workaround: Before upgrading, if you have Hive Metastore installed by
   itself, use the Incremental Install feature of the MapR Installer to
   install Hive. Then proceed with the upgrade.

   Performing an upgrade without doing the Incremental Install of Hive
   will cause the upgrade to fail. In this scenario, you will have to
   reinstall or rebuild the database by using Stanza commands. You can use
   the reset command, followed by probe, and then edit the versions in the
   resulting YAML file. The last step is to import the edited YAML using
   the import command. See [23]Using probe and import to Generate the
   Installer Database.
   N/A The MapR Installer Web Interface can inadvertently deselect
   services that you have selected, preventing them from being installed.
   For example, if you select an auto-provisioning template on the Select
   Services page, and you also select additional services (for example,
   Streams Tools), and go to the next page, when you return to the Select
   Services page, Streams Tools will be deselected, and you will need to
   reselect it to ensure that it is installed.
   MapR‑22652 The MapR Installer does not prevent the selection of Impala
   2.2 when the cluster will be installed on Ubuntu nodes. Since Impala
   2.2 is not supported on Ubuntu, the installation will not complete
   successfully.
   MapR‑20606 The Configure Service Layout page may assign services to a
   group with the name "Unprovisioned Services."

   Workaround: In the MapR Installer Web Interface, click Restore Default.
   N/A You cannot use the MapR Installer after you upgrade the cluster
   using the command line.

   After you use the command line to upgrade a cluster that you installed
   with the MapR Installer, the MapR Installer is not aware that the
   cluster runs the upgraded version. Therefore, MapR Installer does not
   install nodes and ecosystem components that apply to the upgraded
   version.

   Workaround: Use the MapR Installer Stanzas probe and import commands to
   update the installer database. See [24]Using probe and import to
   Generate the Installer Database.
   MapR-19727 On nodes running RedHat/CentOS 6.5 or older, JDK 1.7 may
   cause an SSL connection error when you attempt to access the MapR
   Installer web interface.

   Workaround:
    1. Install JDK 1.8.
    2. Use the alternatives system to set JDK 1.8 as the default Java. Or,
       uninstall JDK 1.7.

   MapR-18668 Hue does not work on RedHat/CentOS 7 when it is configured
   to use a MySQL database.

   When this issue occurs, the MapR Control System (MCS) displays the "Hue
   Down Alarm."
   Workaround:
    1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the Redhat 6
       compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
ver=$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d- -f2)
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$ver/rhel7-amd64/rpms/MariaDB-$ver-cent
os7-x86_64-compat.rpm
    2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus SASL
       library:
ln -s /lib64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /lib64/libsasl2.so.2
    3. Run the following command to reconfigure Hue:
bash -c "source /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/build/env/bin/activate;
      /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/build/env/bin/hue syncdb --noinput;
      /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/build/env/bin/hue migrate"
    4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <space separated list of
      hostnames>

   MapR-18574 Installation may fail on nodes where there is a package
   manager running or a stale lock file exists. When this type of failure
   occurs, the installation log for that node may contain an error message
   similar to the following:
2015-05-08 01:50:22.713: failed: [command /usr/bin/apt-get install -q -y {{mapr.
node.core_packages|sort|join(' ') }}] [10.10.10.162] => {"changed": true,"cmd":
["/usr/bin/apt-get", "install", "-q", "-y", "mapr-cldb",
      "mapr-core","mapr-fileserver", "mapr-httpfs", "mapr-nfs", "mapr-nodemanage
r","mapr-resourcemanager", "mapr-webserver", "mapr-zookeeper"], "delta":"0:00:05
.432067", "end": "2015-05-08 01:50:22.676193", "rc": 100,
      "start":"2015-05-08 01:50:17.244126", "warnings": ["Consider using apt-get
 modulerather than running apt-get"]}

   Workaround: To clean up a running package manager process, run apt-get
   or yum on a shell and follow the instructions provided by the package
   manager.
   Note: When you select a node on the “Installing MapR” page, the option
   to view the installation log for that node displays in the left panel.
   MapR-18507 Metrics does not work on these operating systems: Ubuntu,
   RedHat 7, and SUSE/SLES 12.
   MapR-18388 Known issues with spark-standalone and multiple spark
   masters:
     * After installation, Spark workers may not start due to the
       mechanism used to start services.
     * Spark worker does not start after the node that runs the worker is
       restarted.

   Workaround:To start Spark workers, run the following command as the
   mapr user on each worker node:
/opt/mapr/spark/spark-$VERSION/sbin/start-slave.sh 1 spark://<comma-separated li
st of spark
      master hostname: port>

   Example:
/opt/mapr/spark/spark-$VERSION/sbin/start-slave.sh 1
     spark://host1:7077,host2:7077

   It is important to list all the spark master hostnames so that the
   worker nodes can connect to the active master.
   You can run the following command to determine the nodes that run the
   spark master:
maprcli node list -columns service -filter '[service==spark-master]' -json | gre
p
      \"hostname\": | cut -d \" -f 4
