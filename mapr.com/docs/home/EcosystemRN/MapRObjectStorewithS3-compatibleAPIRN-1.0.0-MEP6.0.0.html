New in This Release

   This is the first release of the MapR Object Store with S3-compatible
   API (MapR Object Store). The MapR Object Store is included in MEP
   repositories beginning with MEP 6.0.0. The MapR Object Store is a S3
   REST API compatible object store that enables you to use the S3 API to
   store and retrieve S3 objects from your cluster. Support for S3 REST
   API fundamentally provides an S3 REST API proxy server for MapR Data
   Platform.

Known Issues

       fs.s3a.endpoint property contains the domain as a string.
     * S3-122: Events sent by Kafka notification does not contain bucket
       owner information, in case MapR Object Store with S3-Compatible API
       is running in S3-Only mode.
