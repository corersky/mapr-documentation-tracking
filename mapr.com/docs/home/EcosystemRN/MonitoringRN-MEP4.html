New in This Release

   MapR Monitoring in the MEP 4.0.0 release introduces the following
   enhancements:
     * An upgraded component stack.
     * A default security feature that secures the MapR cluster and
       supported ecosystem components, including MapR Monitoring, using
       MapR-SASL and wire-level encryption, as well as the ability to
       configure custom security.
     * A Spyglass on Streams feature that uses Streams as the default
       mechanism through which metrics flow from collectd to OpenTSDB.
       Note: Writing to an external OpenTSDB is not supported from release
       6.0 onwards.
     * MapR Monitoring now provides metrics for the YARN [3]Resource
       Manager and [4]Node Manager.

Patches

   None

Known Issues and Limitations

   See [5]Known Issues at Release (MapR 6.1.0)

Resolved Issues

     * COLD-4: By default, collectd reads files from the custom
       configuration file directory (/opt/mapr/collectd/conf/) on nodes
       without support for the wordexp function, eliminating the need to
       include Filter "*.conf" in the collectd.conf configuration file.
     * SPYG-838: On secure clusters, JMX ports can no longer be accessed
       without authentication, eliminating the need to setup a password on
       each Node Manager and Resource Manager node.
     * KIB-1: A syntax error in export_cert.sh no longer causes an error
       message when you run configure.sh on a node with Kibana installed
       in a secure cluster.
