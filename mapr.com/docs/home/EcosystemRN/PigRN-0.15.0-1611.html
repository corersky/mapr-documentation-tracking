   Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   06747e5 2016-10-28 MAPR-24456: The issue that caused illustrate query
   to fail in Pig, when used with MRv1, is now fixed. Pig now includes
   different pig-core JAR files for MRv1 and Yarn and it will dynamically
   choose the necessary JAR based on the cluster's mode.
   1ee180c 2016-09-13 PIG-5019: The issue that caused Pig to generate lots
   of warnings for UDF with warnings aggregation enabled is now fixed.
