Patches

   GitHub Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   5a7c872 2015-10-20 MAPR-21019: When Hue submits Oozie jobs, Hue uses
   the default_jobtracker_host value (maprfs:/// ) instead of the
   jobtracker host:port address.
   5f7812d 2015-09-15 MAPR-20441: Hue now automatically detects the Sqoop
   security settings and Hue.ini no longer contains the sqoop_conf_dir
   property.
   569dbf5 2015-09-15 MAPR-20438: Hue is now able to connect to the
   ResourceManager on secure cluster because the path to ssl_cacerts in
   the hue.ini was corrected.
   6fd0484 2015-09-07 MAPR-20357: Job browser is now able to display jobs
   when the cluster runs in classic mode.
   ecdd711 2015-09-07 MAPR-20440: Hue now automatically detects the Hive
   security mechanism and therefore hive action statements in Oozie
   workflows no longer fail.

Known Issues

     * HUE-2673: Hue displays a timeout error when a new session is not
       started within 60 seconds due to the lack of YARN resources.
     * MapR-20358: Hive job from Job Designer examples fails on YARN mode
       without oozie patch for 2015-10-23.
     * MapR-18668: Hue does not work on RedHat/CentOS 7 when it is
       configured to use a MySQL database.
       When this issue occurs, the MapR Control System (MCS) displays the
       "Hue Down Alarm."
       Workaround:
         1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the Redhat 6
            compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d-
        -f2)/rhel7-amd64/rpms/MariaDB-5.5.41-centos7_0-x86_64-compat.rpm
         2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus
            SASL library:
ln -s /lib64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /lib64/libsasl2.so.2
         3. Run the following command to reconfigure Hue:
bash -c "./opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.0/build/env/bin/activate; /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.
0/build/env/bin/hue
      syncdb --noinput; /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.9.0/build/env/bin/hue migrate"
         4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <space separated list of
      hostnames>
