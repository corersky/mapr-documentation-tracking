New in this Release

   Drill 1.15.0.0 includes the following new features and improvements in
   the following areas:

   Storage

          + Ability to query data in S3 via the new cloud [11]storage
            plugin for S3. (MD-4541)
          + Credential Provider API support in the [12]S3 storage plugin.
            (MD-4543, DRILL-6662)
          + The INFORMATION_SCHEMA [13]FILES table provides information
            about directories and files stored in [14]workspaces
            configured within [15]S3 and [16]file system storage plugin
            configurations. (MD-4544, DRILL-6680)

   SQL

          + [17]TIMESTAMPADD and [18]TIMESTAMPDIFF datetime functions.
            (MD-342, DRILL-3610)
          + [19]CROSS JOIN in the FROM clause. (MD-4359, DRILL-786)
          + Support for column aliases and positional aliases in the
            [20]GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses. (MD-4825,
            DRILL-1248)
          + [21]Lateral join functionality is enabled by default.
            (DRILL-6729)
          + [22]Storage plugin names are case-insensitive. (MD-4589,
            MD-4663, DRILL-6492, DRILL-6768)
          + All [23]cast and data type conversion functions return null
            for an empty string ('') when the
            drill.exec.functions.cast_empty_string_to_null option is
            enabled. (DRILL-6817)
          + A new option, exec.query.return_result_set_for_ddl,
            [24]prevents Drill from returning a result set for DDL
            statements when set to "false." Useful for clients tools that
            connect to Drill (via JDBC) if they do not expect a result
            set. (MD-4757, DRILL-6834)

   Query optimization

            next to executing queries.
          + The auto prompt in the Web UI SQL box now works on UDFs.
          + An enhanced Options page that includes detailed descriptions
            of each option.
          + Categorized options via Quick Filters on the Options page.
            (DRILL-5735)
          + Default button (DRILL-6668)
          + [30]Web display options and updated option names (MD-4835,
            DRILL-6544, DRILL-6715)
          + [31]Meta+Enter key combination to submit queries (DRILL-6611)

          + [34]System options table includes option descriptions.
            (DRILL-6684)
          + [35]System functions table exposes the available SQL functions
            in Drill and also detects UDFs that have been dynamically
            loaded into Drill. (MD-4941, DRILL-3988)

   Drill 1.15 Release Notes.

Default Configuration Changes

   Starting in MEP 6.1.0, certain ecosystem components, including Drill,
   have four digit version numbers. For example, when you install Drill,
   the Drill version appears as 1.15.0.0.

Resolved Issues

   Drill 1.15.0.0 includes the following resolved issues:
   MapR Tracking Number Resolved Issue
   MD-5253 The TO_TIMESTAMP function no longer loses precision for
   milliseconds.
   MD-5226 DRILL-6918: Querying empty topics no longer fails with a
   "NumberFormatException."
   MD-5208 Semi-join queries on sf1 data no longer return an
   UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION error.
   MD-5149 DRILL-6869: Drill no longer allows views created outside of
   workspaces.
   MD-5147 DRILL-6865: Queries no longer return the wrong results when
   filter pruning occurs.
   MD-5142 DRILL-6857: Limit is pushed into the scan when selecting from a
   Parquet file with multiple row groups.
   MD-5138 DRILL-6863: Drop table works when the path is within a
   workspace that starts with '/'.
   MD-5105 DRILL-6818: Secondary index options have descriptions.
   MD-5076 DRILL-6811: Type inference returns the correct data mode for
   boolean functions.
   MD-5062 DRILL-6664: Drill returns the same results for queries on the
   same column of a Parquet table with the same predicate.
   MD-5057 Queries against new files created on a volume that has reached
   the name container data threshold no longer fail with I/O exceptions.
   MD-5023 DRILL-6810: Drill does not support nullable complex types
   (maps, arrays); therefore, UDFs cannot return null if @Output is of a
   complex type. Null handling of complex types is disabled by default.
   NullHandling.INTERNAL should be used instead of
   NullHandling.NULL_IF_NULL in UDFs. When using NullHandling.INTERNAL,
   the UDF must handle null input(s) on its own.
   MD-5019 DRILL-6797: Drill aggregation queries that use custom UDF to
   split column data in a Parquet file no longer fail with a compilation
   error if the filter criteria results in no rows.
   MD-5014 DRILL-6776: The Drill Web UI page source no longer has links to
   external sites.
   MD-5008

   Drill can leverage indexes for queries with ORDER BY DESC on indexed
   columns; for example, if a secondary index is defined on column a,
   Drill leverages the index for the query:

   SELECT a FROM t ORDER BY a DESC;
   MD-5002 DRILL-6764: Queries no longer fail with IOB exception when
   UNNEST references a deep nested field, like t.c_orders.o_lineitems.
   MD-5001

   DRILL-6766 : Queries with LATERAL UNNEST no longer return the following
   system error when one batch of streaming aggregates is split across
   multiple output batches :

   IllegalStateException: Unexpected case where rowId [] in right batch of
   lateral is smaller than rowId [] in left batch being processed.
   MD-4968 DRILL-6762: Dynamic UDFs registered on one Drillbit are now
   visible on other Drillbits.
   MD-4956 DRILL-6755: Hash-Join does not build hash tables when the probe
   side is empty.
   MD-4938 The option planner.index.covering_selectivity_threshold takes
   effect in execution plan when set to values < 1.0 for complex data.
   MD-4936 DRILL-6773: Queries, with column aliases, that returned
   inconsistent results after a Drill patch was applied no longer return
   inconsistent results.
   MD-4867 DRILL-6726: Drill can query views created before DRILL-6492
   when impersonation is enabled.
   MD-4852 DRILL-6819: The invisible "back" link on the query results page
   in the Drill WebUI has been removed.
   MD-4851 Drill queries on MapRDB JSON tables no longer fail on schema
   change when the only distinct values are null and text.
   MD-4801 DRILL-6724: Operator context is dumped to logs when errors
   occur during query execution.
   MD-4780 DRILL-6746: Queries no longer hang when one of the nodes
   encounters a connection error.
   MD-4755 DRILL-6709: The batch statistics logging utility has been
   extended to mid-stream operators.
   MD-4643 DRILL-6732: Disabled plugins no longer work as enabled.
   MD-4617 "direct.used" metrics(jvm_direct_current) catches the direct
   memory usage.
   MD-4585 The drillbit.log file includes query user information.
   MD-4567 DRILL-6517 : Hash-Join no longer accesses batches after query
   cancellation.
   MD-4499 DRILL-5365: File not found exception no longer results from
   reading a Parquet file.
   MD-4362 Drill no longer fails to generate a non-covering index plan for
   queries on data with the reserved word 'date' as a column name.
   MD-3879 DRILL-6039: Graceful shutdown waits for fragments to complete
   before stopping the Drillbit.
   MD-2979 DRILL-6410: The Parquet reader no longer leaks memory during
   query cancellation.
