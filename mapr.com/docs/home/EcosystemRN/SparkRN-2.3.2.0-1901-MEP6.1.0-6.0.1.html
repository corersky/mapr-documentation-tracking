   This section provides reference information, including new features,
   patches, and known issues for Spark 2.3.2.0.

   The notes below relate specifically to the MapR Distribution for Apache
   Hadoop. This release of Spark has backward-compatibility changes, see
   the open-source [1]Spark 2.3.2.0 Release Notes for more information.

   These release notes contain only MapR-specific information and are not
   necessarily cumulative in nature. For information about how to use the
   release notes, see [2]Ecosystem Component Release Notes.

   Package Names Navigate to [6]https://package.mapr.com/releases/MEP/ and
   select your MEP and OS to view the list of package names.
   Important:
     * Starting with MEP 6.0.0, keyStore and trustStore passwords can be
       removed from the spark-defaults.conf file and can be set in the
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl-client.xml file.
     * Starting with MEP 6.0.0, after an upgrade, configuration files of
       previous versions are saved in the /opt/mapr/spark directory.
     * The MapR 6.1 and MEP 6.0.0 release introduces "Simplified
       Security". If you are using these versions and enable security on
       your MapR cluster, MapR scripts automatically configure Spark
       security features.

Hive Support

   This version of Spark supports integration with Hive. However, note the
   following exceptions:
     * Hive-on-Spark is not supported.
     * Spark-SQL is supported, but it is not fully compatible with Hive.
       For details, see the [7]Apache Spark documentation and the [8]MapR
       Spark documentation.
