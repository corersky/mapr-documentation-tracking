Known Issues and Limitations

     * Impersonation is not supported for Kafka REST Proxy for MapR-ES.
       Kafka REST is run as mapr user which means that you must explicitly
       give mapr user permissions to consume and produce from/to streams.
       For example, the consumeperm parameter must be set to mapr user to
       be able to consume and the produceperm parameter must be set to
       mapr user to be able to produce.
