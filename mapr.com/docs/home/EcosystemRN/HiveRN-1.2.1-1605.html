Patches

   This release by MapR includes the following patches on the base Apache
   release. For complete details, refer to the commit log for this project
   in GitHub.
   Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   0304149f 2016-05-20 MAPR-22357: The buffer underflow (while performing
   Hive queries) caused by small Kryo buffer size is now fixed with a new
   parameter, hive.kryo.buffer.size in hive-site.xml file, which can be
   used to control Kryo buffer size. The default value for Kryo buffer
   size is now 10 * 4096.
   b3e811b 2016-05-12 MAPR-23302: ListBucketing tables with uppercase skew
   values can now be created.
   5673a07 2016-05-11 MAPR-23221: The mismatch between the MapR native
   library included in the standalone Hive JDBC jar file and the native
   library in MapR is now fixed. The standalone Hive JDBC jar file no
   longer inlcudes MapR native library.
   130887f 2016-05-10 MAPR-22222: The delay as a result of a single reduce
   task in the last stage is now fixed with a new parameter,
   hive.groupby.limit.extrastep, which can be used to enable or disable a
   new MR job for sorting the final output.
   b48f8e6 2016-05-10 MAPR-23264: The issue with access to Hive 1.2 table
   data is now fixed.
   0b3fa65 2016-04-28 MAPR-23220: The issue that caused
   IndexOutOfBoundsException when running a query in Hive 1.2 is now
   fixed.
   7976893 2016-04-28 MAPR-23029: Changed the Primary Key for table
   PARTITION_STATS_V2 from varchar(4000) to varchar(3072) as MySQL does
   not support varchar(4000) as Primary Key.
   fa8e936 2016-04-26 HIVE-12469: The commons-collections 3.2.1 library
   that allowed invocation of arbitrary code is now replaced with
   commons-collections 3.2.2 to resolve this issue.
   703c2f3 2016-04-25 MAPR-23153: Hive will no longer create scratch dir
   with incorrect permissions when a CTAS query is run. If CTAS query is
   run, now, the table root directory with correct permissions from
   fs.permissions.umask-mode will be created first and then the scratch
   dir with permissions from hive.scrach.dir.permissions will be created.
   41a827a 2016-04-14 MAPR-23082: Beeline will no longer fail with
   NullPointerException when MAPR-SASL is used.
     2016-04-14 MAPR-23084: The datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll property
   in hive-site.xml file is now set to true by default.
   9f82b07 2016-04-01 MAPR-22994: The issue causing Hive table creation on
   existing HBase table to fail has been fixed.
