   This is the initial release of Hive 0.13 for the MapR distribution for
   Hadoop.

Known Issues

   MapR Issue Description
   14397 Impala only runs with Hive 0.12. Earlier versions of Hive and
   Hive 0.13 are not supported with Impala.

Patches

   This release by MapR includes the following patches on the base Apache
   release. For complete details, refer to the commit log for this project
   in GitHub.

   MapR 10677. Hive task temp files are now written to the task's spill
   directory in a MapRFS local volume instead of the local filesystem. To
   write temp files to the local filesystem, change the value of the
   hive.exec.tmp.maprfsvolume attribute in the hive-site.xml file to
   false.
   Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   09529ed 14-May-2014 MapR 12909. Resolves scratchdir user permissions
   issues related to impersonation when starting HiveServer2 for the first
   time. When impersonation is enabled, HiveServer2 sets the permissions
   on the root scratch directory (by default, /user/mapr-user/tmp/hive) to
   777. These permissions enable the creation of query-specific scratch
   subdirectories for impersonated users.
   cbc8a7b 16-May-2014 [[6]HIVE-6245] and MapR 13847. Resolves
   impersonation issues with remote MetaStore in HiveServer 2 when
   hive.metastore.execute.setugi property is set to true.
   3e78db6 16-May-2014 MapR 13477. The LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable now
   includes the path to libjpam.so. Users no longer need to download and
   configure libjpam.so during HiveServer2 configuration.
   7973de9 22-May-2014 MapR 13872. Improved support for Beeline with Hive
   13 on MapR.
   cf24ff5 23-Apr-2014 [[7]HIVE-4133] Fixes a ClassNotFoundException error
   in the EventCounter.
   a2f9ecd 23-Apr-2014 [[8]HIVE-4969] and MapR 10948. The HCatLoader class
   now returns complete table information.
   5a02b20 23-Apr-2014 [[9]HIVE-5631] and MapR 11291. Skewed tables can
   now have indexes created.
   119d60c 23-Apr-2014
   fef36c1 24-Apr-2014 [[10]HIVE-3844] and MapR 9663. Hive TIMESTAMP
   column type now supports required timestamp formats.
   0efe07d 24-Apr-2014 MapR 8765. Hive now correctly computes the
   JobTracker location in case of failure.
   be1996b 24-Apr-2014 MapR 11554. ASTNodeOrigin objects serialize and
   deserialize correclty.
   b1d9ac7 24-Apr-2014 MapR 10677. Hive task temp files are now written to
   the task's spill directory in a MapRFS local volume instead of the
   local filesystem. To write temp files to the local filesystem, change
   the value of the hive.exec.tmp.maprfsvolume attribute in the
   hive-site.xml file to false.
   27e9a32 25-Apr-2014 MapR 11012. Hive now uses scratch directories that
   are subdirectories of the target table's home directory, eliminating
   cross-volume copies and improving performance. This optimization is
   disabled by default. For details on how to enable the option, see Hive.
   5bace77 25-Apr-2014 MapR 12673. When the cluster is secure, HiveServer2
   has PAM authentication enabled with 'login' profile by default. The
   default configuration is equivalent to the following property values:
hive.server2.authentication=CUSTOM
                  hive.server2.authentication.pam.profiles=login
                  hive.server2.custom.authentication.class=org.apache.hive.servi
ce.auth.PamAuthenticationProvider

   a682974 01-May-2014 [[11]HIVE-5677]. Fixes a condtion where Hive
   services generate errors when HIVE_OPTS is set.

   to a mismatch in the version string in the JAR file.
