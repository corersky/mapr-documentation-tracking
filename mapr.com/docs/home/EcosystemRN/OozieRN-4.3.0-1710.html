New in This Release

     * Simplified Security - Starting in the MapR 6.0 and MEP 4.0
       releases, you can use the "Enable Security" check box in the
       installer to enable security for the core platform and the
       installed ecosystem components. Alternatively, you can use the
       configure.sh -secure command to enable security for the core and
       the ecosystem components. See [6]Configuring Oozie on a Secure
       Cluster for details on how this impacts Oozie.
