New in This Release

   This version of Hive includes the following:
     * Hive Hybrid Procedural SQL On Hadoop (HPL/SQL)
       Hive Hybrid Procedural SQL On Hadoop (HPL/SQL), which is available
       in Hive 2.1, is a tool that implements procedural SQL for Hive.
       HPL/SQL is an open source tool that implements procedural SQL
       language for Apache Hive, SparkSQL, Impala, as well as any other
       SQL-on-Hadoop implementation, any NoSQL, and any RDBMS.
       HPL/SQL is a hybrid and heterogeneous language that understands
       syntaxes and semantics of almost any existing procedural SQL
       dialect, and you can use with any database (for example, running
       existing Oracle PL/SQL code on Apache Hive and Microsoft SQL
       Server, or running Transact-SQL on Oracle, Cloudera Impala, or
       Amazon Redshift).
       Note: Create the hplsql-site.xml file to configure HPL/SQL feature.
       See [9]http://www.hplsql.org/configuration for more information.
     * Dynamically partitioned hash join for Tez.
     * Support for aggregate push down through joins.
     * DBTokenStore support to HS2 delegation token.
     * Hive View Column Authorization.
     * UDF substring_index
       Returns the substring from string str before count occurrences of
       the delimiter.
     * Quarter UDF
       The quarter from a string / date / timestamp returned by the
       QUARTER(date) function may be useful for different domains like
       retail, finance etc.
     * Support for limited integer type promotion in ORC.
     * ORC file dump in JSON format
       ORC file dump uses custom format. Will be useful to dump ORC
       metadata in json format so that other tools can be built on top it.
     * UDF aes_encrypt and aes_decrypt with AES (Advanced Encryption
       Standard) algorithm.
       Oracle JRE supports AES-128 out of the box AES-192 and AES-256 are
       supported if Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
       Jurisdiction Policy Files are installed.
     * Possibility for Hive Parser to support multi col in clause (x,y..)
       in ((..),..., ()).
     * Support of special characters in quoted table names.
     * Support for "show create database".
     * Support escaping carriage return and new line for LazySimpleSerDe.
     * Banker's rounding BROUND UDF
       With banker's rounding, the value is rounded to the nearest even
       number. Also known as "Gaussian rounding", and, in German,
       "mathematische Rundung".
     * Command to kill an ACID transaction.
       This cleans up all state related to this transaction. The initiator
       of this (if still alive) will get an error trying to
       heartbeat/commit and will become aware that the transaction failed.
     * Support for modifying the numRows and dataSize for a
       table/partition.
     * Support vectorizing when the input format is TEXTFILE and other
       formats for better Map Vertex performance.
     * Support for NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST.
       The NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST options can be used to determine
       whether nulls appear before or after non-null data values when the
       ORDER BY clause is used.
     * Supports aggregate functions in over clause.

Known Issues and Limitations

   Known Issues

   Sqoop import to Hive as parquet file fails when the entire cluster is
          configured to use Tez.
          This is because of sqoop's incompatibility with Tez.

          Workaround: Do not configure the entire cluster to use Tez.

   Percentage sampling is not supported in
          org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat.
          Hive uses org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat by
          default and so queries like 'SELECT * FROM tablename
          TABLESAMPLE(20 percent);' will not work for Hive on Tez.

          Workaround: Instead of
          org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat, use
          org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat.

          To change input format, do one of the following:

          + Set hive.tez.input.format in hive shell. For example:
hive> set hive.tez.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFor
mat;
          + Add org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat to
            hive-site.xml file. For example:
<property>
  <name>hive.tez.input.format</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat</value>
</property>

   Limitations
     * MapR does not support Hive on Spark. Therefore, you cannot use
       Spark as an execution engine for Hive. However, you can run Hive
       and Spark on the same cluster. You can also use Spark SQL and Drill
       to query Hive tables.
     * MapR does not support HDFS encryption in Hive tables.
     * MapR does not support Hbase-0.9X with Hive-2.1.1. Only Hbase-1.X is
       compatible with Hive-2.1.1.
     * MapR does not support LLAP with Hive-2.1.1 since Apache Slider is
       not in the MapR ecosystem
     * MapR does not support Apache Knox and Apache Ranger. HiveServer2
       HTTP mode is not available with X-Forwarded-Host header for
       authorization/audits.
     * MapR does not support masking and filtering of rows/columns since
       Apache Ranger is not in the MapR ecosystem.

Resolved Issues

   None.
