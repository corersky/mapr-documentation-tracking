MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes Release 1.0.2

   These notes describe version 1.0.2 of the MapR Data Fabric for
   Kubernetes.

   You may also be interested in the [1]Kubernetes Release Notes.
   Version 1.0.2
   Release Date July 2018
   MapR Version Interoperability Compatible with MapR 5.2.2 or later.
   Note: Version 1.0.2 does not support the coexistence of MapR and
   Kubernetes software on the same nodes. If your installation requires
   MapR and Kubernetes software to coexist on the same nodes, see the
   [2]MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes release notes to identify the latest
   version that supports coexistence.
   OS Compatibility The operating system (OS) on a node where the volume
   plug-in is installed must be a supported OS for the MapR version. For a
   list of supported OS versions, see [3]Operating System Support Matrix
   (MapR 6.x).
   Kubernetes Compatibility Kubernetes 1.9 or later.
   Note: Kubernetes alpha features are not supported.

New in This Release

   Version 1.0.2 of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes can only be used
   on cluster nodes that are installed with MapR software (MapR 5.2.2 or
   later). Version 1.0.2 cannot be used on cluster nodes having both MapR
   and Kubernetes software.

   This release of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes includes a set of
   Docker containers and their respective .yaml configuration files that
   can be installed onto a Kubernetes cluster. Once installed, these
   containers provide a Kubernetes FlexVolume Driver for MapR Filesystem
   and a Kubernetes Dynamic Volume Provisioner that permit static and
   dynamic provisioning of MapR storage from Kubernetes.

Patches

   None.

Known Issues and Limitations

   Note these limitations:
     * Version 1.0.2 does not support the coexistence of MapR and
       Kubernetes software on the same nodes. If your installation
       requires MapR and Kubernetes software to coexist on the same nodes,
       see the [10]MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes release notes to
       identify the latest version that supports coexistence.
     * All nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must use the same Linux OS.
       Configuration files are available to support these Linux
       distributions:
          + CentOS
          + RedHat (use CentOS configuration file)
          + SSE (use CentOS configuration file)
          + Ubuntu
     * Docker for Mac with Kubernetes is not supported as a development
       platform for containers used with the MapR Data Fabric for
       Kubernetes.
     * Volume plug-in files are supported for:
          + CentOS
          + Ubuntu
          + Microsoft Azure AKS
          + Red Hat OpenShift**
          + Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
     * Amazon EKS is not supported.
     * The Basic POSIX client package is included by default when you
       install the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes. The Platinum POSIX
       client can be enabled by specifying a parameter in the Pod spec.
       Only the POSIX client is supported. NFSv3 is not supported.

   **OpenShift Origin is supported because it supports Kubernetes 1.9. The
   OpenShift Container Platform (formerly known as OpenShift Enterprise)
   can be used only if it supports Kubernetes 1.9.

Resolved Issues

   Issue Description
   K8S-139 Version 1.0.2 includes a fix for UID/GID handling in secure,
   non-impersonated environments. Before Version 1.0.2, if the UID/GID of
   the ticket was different from the UID/GID of the container, write
   operations could fail. With this fix, if the UID/GID of the ticket is
   different from the UID/GID of the container, all operations are
   performed using the UID/GID of the ticket.
   K8S-164 In version 1.0.1, SELinux relabeling on the pod-container
   volume mounts caused an issue with the flexvolume-mounted file system.
   (SELinux relabeling is enabled by default for the volume plug-in in
   version 1.0.1.) In version 1.0.2, the volume plug-in resolves the issue
   by opting out of SELinux relabeling, reporting selinux Relabel:false in
   its init call.
