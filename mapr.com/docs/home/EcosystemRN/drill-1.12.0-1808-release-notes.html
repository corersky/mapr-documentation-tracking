Fixes

   Drill 1.12.0-1808 provides the following fixes:
   Fix Tracking Numbers Descriptions
   MD-4509 Query plans with CAST indexes are generated for LIKE filters
   with CAST functions.
   MD-4444 Issuing the CTAS command against a MapR Database table no
   longer returns a NullPointerException.
   MD-4156 Queries on a single Parquet column no longer fail with an
   ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
   MD-4048 The io.dropwizard.metrics have been removed from Drill.
   MD-3979 Queries that use CAST index plans no longer fail with a
   NullPointerException.
   MD-3716 (DRILL-6223) Queries on complex nested data in Parquet files no
   longer fail when selecting on all columns.
   MD-3544 Queries on complex nested data in Parquet files no longer fail.
   DRILL-6557 Drill no longer fetches all the input splits when Hive
   statistics provide the number of bytes, which improves query planning
   time for queries on Hive data.
   DRILL-6204 When the store.hive.optimize_scan_with_native_readers option
   is enabled, Drill separates the partitioned columns from the
   non-partition columns when reading Hive data directly from the
   filesystem. This prevents Drill from returning an error if the reader
   cannot find partitioned columns in the table schema.
   DRILL-6195 Drill can query Hive partitioned bucketed tables.
   DRILL-6164 Drill no longer returns out-of-memory errors due to memory
   leaks caused by the buildup of Parquet reader references that the
   scanner does not remove.
   DRILL-5978 Hive libraries are updated to version 2.1.2-mapr-1710.
   DRILL-4185 Drill supports queries with JOIN and UNION [ALL] operators
   on empty directories.
