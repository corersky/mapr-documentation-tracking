     * [SPARK-11352][SQL][BRANCH-1.5] Escape */ in the generated comments.
     * [SPARK-12138][SQL] Escape \u in the generated comments of codegen

       not actually safe

   For more information, see [7]Spark Vulnerability with the
   toCommentSafeString Method.
   fc72384 2016-08-22 MAPR-24318: Backported SPARK -1191 and SPARK-11311

Known Issues

     * MAPR-17271: On secure clusters, the MapR Control System (MCS) does
       not display links for Spark-Master and Spark-HistoryServer.
     * MAPR-19761: On a secure cluster, MapR does not support the Spark
       SQL Thrift JDBC server. When the cluster is secure, the Spark
       Thrift server will not start.
     * MAPR-22940/SPARK-11851: On clusters that use Kerberos
       authentication, Spark Thrift Server is unable to connect to
       beeline.
