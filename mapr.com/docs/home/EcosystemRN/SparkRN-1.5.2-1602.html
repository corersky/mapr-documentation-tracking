   GitHub Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   784ad2e 2016-01-13 MAPR-22122: Spark now supports the Kafka 0.9.0
   Streaming Consumer API.

Known Issues

     * MAPR-17271: On secure clusters, the MapR Control System (MCS) does
       not display links for Spark-Master and Spark-HistoryServer.
     * MAPR-19761: On a secure cluster, MapR does not support the Spark
       SQL Thrift JDBC server. When the cluster is secure, the Spark
       Thrift server will not start.
     * MAPR-22522: Spark jobs fail when Hive uses Kerberos authentication
       on a secure cluster that also uses Kerberos authentication.
       Workaround: Add "-Dhadoop.login=hybrid" to SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS in
       spark-env.sh ($SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-env.sh). For example:
 if [ "$MAPR_SECURITY_STATUS" = "true" ]; then
SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS="$SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS -Dmapr_sec_enabled=true -Dhadoop.login=hyb
rid"
