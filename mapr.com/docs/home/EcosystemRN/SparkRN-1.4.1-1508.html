Hive Support

     * This version of Spark supports Spark-SQL with Hive 0.13. However,
       Hive on Spark is not supported.
     * Spark-SQL is not fully compatible with Hive; see the [4]Apache
       Spark documentation for details.

Known Issues

   MAPR-17271:
          On secure clusters, the MapR Control System (MCS) does not
          display links for Spark-Master and Spark-HistoryServer.

   MAPR-19761:
          On a secure cluster, MapR does not support the Spark SQL Thrift
          JDBC server. When the cluster is secure, the Spark Thrift server
          will not start.
