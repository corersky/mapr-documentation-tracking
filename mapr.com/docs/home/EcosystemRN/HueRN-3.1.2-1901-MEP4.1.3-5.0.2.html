Known Issues and Limitations

     * MapR does not support the integration between Hue 3.12.0 and the
       following components:
          + Solr Search
          + ZooKeeper
     * Integration between Hue 3.12.0 and Sentry 1.7 is supported on
       secure clusters that use Kerberos authentication, but it is not
       supported on secure clusters that use MapR-SASL authentication.
     * MAPR-2561: DB Query in Hue cannot execute more than one query.
     * HUE-6074: [notebook] Execute snippets as Oozie batch.
     * MAPR-28087: Livy cannot use the Hive Interpreter. To work around
       this issue, use the cluster mode. Set livy.spark.deployMode=cluster
       in the {LIVY_CONF}/livy.conf file. This issue is caused by Spark
       11851: "Unable to start spark thrift server against secured hive
       metastore(GSS initiate failed)".

   Note: Hue uses [8]python parquet lib to read parquet files. This
   library does not support all possible parquet formats.

Resolved Issues

     * None.
