New in this Release

   This is the initial release of Hive 1.0 for the MapR distribution for
   Hadoop. In addition to Hive 1.0 features, this release includes the
   following features:
     * MapR-SASL Support
       On secure MapR clusters, MapR-SASL is supported and configured by
       default for HiveServer2 and HiveMetastore. Previously, Simple SASL
       was the default and authentication had to be configured manually.
     * Hive Scratch Directory Changes
       By default, the Hive scratch directory is created in the same
       volume as the target table (hive.optimize.insert.dest.volume=true).
       Previously, hive.optimize.insert.dest.volume was set to false.
     * WebHCat Changes
          + The default WebHCat log directory is now
            /opt/mapr/hive/<hive-version>/logs/<username>/webhcat.
            Previously, it was /tmp/<username>/webhcat.
          + WebHCat is now managed by Warden. The warden.hcat.conf file is
            installed with the mapr-hive package.
     * JDBC SASL QOP Parameter Changes
       When you need to connect via JDBC to hiveserver2 using the SASL QOP
       parameter, use salsQop instead of sals.qop.

   Important: The Hive 1.0 cost-based optimization is a beta feature and
   is not fully supported.
