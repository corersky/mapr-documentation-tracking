New in This Release

   This first release of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes introduces a
   set of Docker containers and their respective .yaml configuration files
   that can be installed onto a Kubernetes cluster. Once installed, these
   containers provide a Kubernetes FlexVolume Driver for MapR Filesystem
   and a Kubernetes Dynamic Volume Provisioner that permit static and
   dynamic provisioning of MapR storage from Kubernetes.

Patches

   None.

Known Issues and Limitations

   Note these limitations:
     * Version 1.0 does not support the coexistence of MapR and Kubernetes
       software on the same nodes. If your installation requires MapR and
       Kubernetes software to coexist on the same nodes, see the [9]MapR
       Data Fabric for Kubernetes release notes to identify the latest
       version that supports coexistence.
     * All nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must use the same Linux OS.
       Configuration files are available to support these Linux
       distributions:
          + CentOS
          + RedHat (use CentOS configuration file)
          + SSE (use CentOS configuration file)
          + Ubuntu
     * Docker for Mac with Kubernetes is not supported as a development
       platform for containers used with the MapR Data Fabric for
       Kubernetes.
     * Volume plug-in files are supported for:
          + CentOS
          + Ubuntu
          + Microsoft Azure AKS
          + Red Hat OpenShift**
          + Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
     * Amazon EKS is not supported.
     * The Basic POSIX client package is included by default when you
       install the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes. The Platinum POSIX
       client can be enabled by specifying a parameter in the Pod spec.
       Only the POSIX client is supported. NFSv3 is not supported.

   **OpenShift Origin is supported because it supports Kubernetes 1.9. The
   OpenShift Container Platform (formerly known as OpenShift Enterprise)
   can be used only if it supports Kubernetes 1.9.
