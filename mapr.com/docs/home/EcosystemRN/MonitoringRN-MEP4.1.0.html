New in This Release

   MapR Monitoring in the MEP 4.1.0 release introduces the following
   enhancements:
     * File permissions changed to ensure compliance with the MapR
       Security Policy.
     * The following rules are added for specifying metric names:
          + Strings are case sensitive: for example, "Sys.Cpu.User" is
            stored separately from "sys.cpu.user".
          + Spaces are not allowed.
          + Only the following characters are allowed: a to z, A to Z, 0
            to 9, -, _, ., / or Unicode letters (as per the
            specification).
          + Metric and tags are not limited in length, though you must try
            to keep the values fairly short.
