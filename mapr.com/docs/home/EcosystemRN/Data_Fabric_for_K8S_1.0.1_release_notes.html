   *Kubernetes alpha features are not supported.

New in This Release

   Version 1.0.1 of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes can be used:
     * On cluster nodes that are installed with MapR software only (MapR
       5.2.2 or later)
     * On cluster nodes having both MapR software (MapR 6.0.1 or later)
       and Kubernetes software

   This release of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes includes a set of
   Docker containers and their respective .yaml configuration files that
   can be installed onto a Kubernetes cluster. Once installed, these
   containers provide a Kubernetes FlexVolume Driver for MapR Filesystem
   and a Kubernetes Dynamic Volume Provisioner that permit static and
   dynamic provisioning of MapR storage from Kubernetes.

Patches

   None.

Known Issues and Limitations

   Note these limitations:
     * Installations that require MapR and Kubernetes software to coexist
       on the same nodes must use version 1.0.1 of the MapR Data Fabric
       for Kubernetes with MapR 6.0.1 or later.
     * All nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must use the same Linux OS.
       Configuration files are available to support these Linux
       distributions:
          + CentOS
          + RedHat (use CentOS configuration file)
          + SSE (use CentOS configuration file)
          + Ubuntu
     * Docker for Mac with Kubernetes is not supported as a development
       platform for containers used with the MapR Data Fabric for
       Kubernetes.
     * Volume plug-in files are supported for:
          + CentOS
          + Ubuntu
          + Microsoft Azure AKS
          + Red Hat OpenShift**
          + Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
     * Amazon EKS is not supported.
     * The Basic POSIX client package is included by default when you
       install the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes. The Platinum POSIX
       client can be enabled by specifying a parameter in the Pod spec.
       Only the POSIX client is supported. NFSv3 is not supported.

   **OpenShift Origin is supported because it supports Kubernetes 1.9. The
   OpenShift Container Platform (formerly known as OpenShift Enterprise)
   can be used only if it supports Kubernetes 1.9.
