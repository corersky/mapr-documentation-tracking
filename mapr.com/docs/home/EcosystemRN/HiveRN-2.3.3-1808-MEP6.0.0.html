Feature Support

     * MEP 6.0.0 supports Hive-2.3.3 on Tez-0.9.
       For more information, see [8]Tez 0.9.1-1808 (MEP 6.0.0) Release
       Notes.
     * MEP 6.0.0 does not support Hive on Spark, so you cannot use Spark
       as an execution engine for Hive.
       However, you can run Hive and Spark on the same cluster. You can
       also use Spark SQL and Drill to query Hive tables.
     * MEP 6.0.0 does not support HDFS encryption in Hive tables.
     * MEP 6.0.0 does not support HBase with Hive-2.3.3 starting from the
       6.0.0 release.
     * MEP 6.0.0 does not support LLAP with Hive-2.3.3, because Apache
       Slider is not a MapR ecosystem component.
     * Hive 2.1 and later needs to run the schematool command as an
       initialization step.

New Features

     * MERGE operator for MapR Database JSON Tables in Tez mode
       For more information, see [9]Understanding the MERGE Statement.
     * hive.metastore.allow.new.db.in.existing.directory property with
       default value as false
       You must set hive.metastore.allow.new.db.in.existing.directory=true
       in the hive-site.xml file to create a database if the directory
       already exists and then restart Hive Metastore and HiveServer2.
       CAUTION: You cannot set the
       hive.metastore.allow.new.db.in.existing.directory using the Hive
       CLI or Beeline.
     * Ability to read default SSL passwords and keystore location from
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl-client.xml

Changes in Security with Default Configuration

     * The following properties are removed from the default hive-site.xml
       configuration on a secured cluster:
     *

   CAPTION:

                     Property                          Value
       hive.server2.webui.keystore.path     /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore
       hive.server2.webui.keystore.password Default keystore password
     * The following property is added to the hive-site.xml configuration
       by default on a secured cluster:

   CAPTION:

             Property       Value
       hive.server2.use.SSL true
     * Because HiveServer2 is configured to use SSL encryption by default
       starting from Hive-2.3 MEP-6.0.0, you must add ssl=true; to a JDBC
       connection string when using PAM or MapR-SASL authentication.
     * You can configure the JDBC connection string with SSL enabled or
       disabled.
       For more information, refer to [10]Configuring JDBC Connection
       String with SSL Encryption Enabled or Disabled.
     * World-readable permissions enabled for Hive configuration files.

Known Issues

     * In [11]HIVE-19502, you cannot insert values into a table stored by
       JdbcStorageHandler.
     * You cannot connect to a Spark Thrift Server on a Kerberos-secured
       cluster, because Kerberos and SSL are not compatible.
       However, you can modify the hive.server2.use.SSL to false in the
       hive-site.xml file.
     * In MAPR-HIVE-302, you cannot interact with Hive tables on
       PostgreSQL after upgrade.
     * In Bug 32349, Simple Fetch from MapR Database JSON tables does not
       work in the Hive 2.3 release. Workaround: Set
       hive.fetch.task.conversion=none in the hive-site.xml file or using
       the Hive CLI. The hive.fetch.task.conversion property is used for
       query conversion. Some select queries can be converted to a single
       FETCH task that minimizes the latency. Currently, the query should
       be single sourced and not have any subquery and also must not have
       any aggregations or distincts (which incurs RS -
       ReduceSinkOperator, requiring a MapReduce task), lateral views and
       joins:
          + none: disable hive.fetch.task.conversion
          + minimal: SELECT star, filter on partition columns, LIMIT only
          + more: SELECT, filter, LIMIT only (supports TABLESAMPLE and
            virtual columns)
     * A non-administrative user can install hooks, which could represent
       a security vulnerability. See [12]Preventing a Non-Administrative
       User from Installing Hooks for more information.
     * Vectorized execution is a new Hive feature that can show
       performance improvements in some cases and cause stability issues
       with others. The Hive vectorized execution feature has many bugs in
       Hive 2.x. It is recommended to turn off this feature at a system
       level and only use it for certain queries which work fine using it.
       You must evaluate the benefit of this feature against the potential
       stability issues on a case by case basis.
