   spark.sql.hive.metastore.sharedPrefixes is now set automatically based
   on the mode that is used to submit the job.

Known Issues

     * MAPR-17271: On secure clusters, the MapR Control System (MCS) does
       not display links for Spark-Master and Spark-HistoryServer.
     * MAPR-19761: On a secure cluster, MapR does not support the Spark
       SQL Thrift JDBC server. When the cluster is secure, the Spark
       Thrift server will not start.
     * MAPR-20263: On a secure cluster, MapR does not support submitting
       jobs that interacts with Hive Metastore on yarn-cluster mode. When
       the cluster is secure, jobs will not complete successfully.
     * Spark versions up to and including 2.3.0 have the following
       security vulnerability: [7]CVE-2018-1334 Apache Spark local
       privilege escalation vulnerability
