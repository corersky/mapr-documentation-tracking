   Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   bfd4ba9 2016-10-28 MAPR-24456: The issue that caused illustrate query
   to fail in Pig, when used with MRv1, is now fixed. Pig now includes
   different pig-core JAR files for MRv1 and Yarn and it will dynamically
   choose the necessary JAR based on the cluster's mode.
   dfcdfbe 2016-09-13 PIG-5019: The issue that caused Pig to generate lots
   of warnings for UDF with warnings aggregation enabled is now fixed.
   0194066 2016-09-01 MAPR-24442: The issue that caused grunt shell to not
   work in classic mode is now fixed. For running MRv1 in Hadoop2, Pig
   will not use the improved logging available with Pig 0.16.
   cb921bb 2016-08-04 MAPR-24080: The issue that caused Pig jobs with
   Oozie to go into an indefinite loop when there was no JobTracker
   installed on a YARN-only cluster is now fixed.
   Note: For information on the API changes in this version, see [7]Pig
   0.16.0 API.
