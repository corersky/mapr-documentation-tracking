   Fix Tracking Number Description
   MD-5379 DRILL-7018: Fixed Parquet buffer overflow when reading
   timestamp column.
   MD-5272 DRILL-6969: Drill no longer returns inconsistent results when
   reading MapR Database JSON tables using hive plugin when the native
   reader is enabled.
   MD-5257 DRILL-6942: Sort query profiles by duration in the Drill Web UI
   under Profiles tab.
   MD-5062 DRILL-6664: Drill returns the same results for queries on the
   same column of a Parquet table with the same predicate.
   MD-5019 DRILL-6797: Drill aggregation queries that use custom UDF to

   external sites.
   MD-5008

   Drill can leverage indexes for queries with ORDER BY DESC on indexed
   columns; for example, if a secondary index is defined on column a,
   Drill leverages the index for the query:

   SELECT a FROM t ORDER BY a DESC;
   MD-5002 DRILL-6764: Queries no longer fail with
   IndexOutOfBoundsException when UNNEST references a deep nested field,
   like t.c_orders.o_lineitems.
   MD-5001

   DRILL-6766: Queries with LATERAL UNNEST no longer return the following
   system error when one batch of streaming aggregates is split across
   multiple output batches:

   IllegalStateException: Unexpected case where rowId [] in right batch of
   lateral is smaller than rowId [] in left batch being processed.
   MD-4938 The option planner.index.covering_selectivity_threshold takes
   effect in execution plan when set to values < 1.0 for complex data.
   MD-4936 DRILL-6773: Queries, with column aliases, that returned
   inconsistent results after a Drill patch was applied no longer return
   inconsistent results.
   MD-4902 Complex secondary index plans are parallelized when queries
   have AND conditions.
   MD-4851 Drill queries on MapRDB JSON tables no longer fail on schema
   change when the only distinct values are null and text.
   MD-4780 DRILL-6746: Queries no longer hang when one of the nodes
   encounters a connection error.
