New in this Release

   This release of Apache Sentry includes the following behavior changes
   that are specific to the MapR:
     * Hive home directory is now determined correctly.
     * Hive is no longer automatically installed with Sentry. Sentry
       requires Hive. Therefore, on nodes where Sentry is installed,
       verify that Hive 0.13 is installed or install Hive 0.13 manually.

   For details on the features available in the open source version of
   this component, see the [4]Apache Sentry 1.4.0 changelog or the
   [5]Apache Sentry project homepage.
