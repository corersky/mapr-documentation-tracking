Spark 2.0.1-1707 Release Notes

   This section provides reference information, including new features,
   patches, known issues, and limitations for Spark 2.0.1-1707.

   The notes below relate specifically to the MapR Distribution for Apache
   Hadoop. You may also be interested in the open-source [1]Spark 2.0.1
   Release Notes.
   Spark Version 2.0.1
   Release Date August 2017
   MapR Version Interoperability See [2]MEP Components and OS Support.
   Source on GitHub [3]https://github.com/mapr/spark
   GitHub Release Tag 2.0.1-mapr-1707
   Maven Artifacts [4]http://repository.mapr.com/maven/
   Package Names See [5]Package Names for MapR Ecosystem Packs (MEPs)
   Important:
     * Full support of MapR Streams is available only on MapR 5.2 and
       later clusters.
     * You cannot submit Spark jobs in YARN mode when the cluster is
       running in MRv1(classic) mode. This applies even if you have
       installed and configured YARN in your cluster.
     * When integrating Hive with Spark 2.0.1-1707, use Hive 1.2.-1707,
       which contains the fix for MAPR-26310.

Hive Support

   This version of Spark supports integration with Hive. However, note the
   following exceptions:
     * Hive-on-Spark is not supported.
     * Spark-SQL is supported, but it is not fully compatible with Hive.
       For details, see the [6]Apache Spark documentation and the [7]MapR
       Spark documentation.
