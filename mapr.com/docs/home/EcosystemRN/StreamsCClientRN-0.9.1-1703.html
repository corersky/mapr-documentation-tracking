   Client. You can use MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client on MapR
   cluster version 5.2.1 and above.

Patches

     * Fix for bug 778 (Double free when using "topic.blacklist" setting)
       has been backported into this release.

Known Issues and Limitations

     * MapR-26629:Application memory usage may be high due to
       fragmentation when Glibc Malloc is in use. In this case, consider
       tuning the MAX_MALLOC_ARENA environment variable or the M_ARENA_MAX
       tunable to a lower value, such as 1. When the value is 1, the
       amount of fragmentation decreases and the memory usage generally
       decreases by 3 or 4 times as well.
     * MapR-26602:Kafka script bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh cannot be used
       to obtain the consumer group list.
     * MapR-26331:MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka C Client commits when
       "enable.auto.commit"= true and "auto.commit.interval.ms"=0. Apache
       librdkafka, does not commit in this case.
     * MapR-26279:When a producer application creates multiple threads
       using pthread_create() and also calls rd_kafka_destroy(), the
       Streams C client logs the following error:
rdkafka.c:527:rd_kafka_destroy_app: assert: !*"failed to join main thread"
       This issue also occurs with Apache librdkafka 0.9.1.

Resolved Issues

   None.
