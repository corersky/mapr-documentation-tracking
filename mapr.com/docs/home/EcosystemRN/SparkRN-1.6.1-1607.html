   that is specific to MapR:

   Poll Time for Consuming MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
          When Spark consumes MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka messages,
          the default poll time is 1000 milliseconds. Previously, the
          default was 100 milliseconds.

   GitHub Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   c0bb193 2016-06-08 MAPR-23559: Spark now stores PID files in the
   following directory: /opt/mapr/pid
   42d163f 2016-06-08 MAPR-22541: Spark now adds the working directory to
   the CLASSPATH.
   4d048420 2016-06-24 MAPR-23612: Spark no longer hangs due to an
   incorrect offset configuration for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka.
   941e206 2016-06-30 MAPR-23122: Spark Streaming uses
   streams.consumer.zerooffset.on.eof to calculate the offset for MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka.
   25621e4 2016-07-04 MAPR-22940: Spark Thrift Server is now able to start
   on a node where Hive is not running. However, when HiveServer2 uses
   Kerberos authentication, the Spark Thrift Server must run on the same
   node as HiveServer2. Otherwise, beeline will not be able to connect to
   the Spark Thirft Server.
   2a3abdb 2016-07-13 MAPR-23854: Spark is now able to retrieve messages
   from MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka.
   6d8d5d6 2016-07-19 MAPR-24011: Backported SPARK-14699 and SPARK-13352
   to improve Spark performance.
   4df099e 2016-07-19 MAPR-24005: Backported Spark 14699 so that Spark
   standalone Pi jobs no longer generate "Executor lost" errors.

Known Issues

     * MAPR-17271: On secure clusters, the MapR Control System (MCS) does
       not display links for Spark-Master and Spark-HistoryServer.
     * MAPR-19761: On a secure cluster, MapR does not support the Spark
       SQL Thrift JDBC server. When the cluster is secure, the Spark
       Thrift server will not start.
     * Spark versions up to and including 2.3.0 have the following
       security vulnerability: [5]CVE-2018-1334 Apache Spark local
       privilege escalation vulnerability
