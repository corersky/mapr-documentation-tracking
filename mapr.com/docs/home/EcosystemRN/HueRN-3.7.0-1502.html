New in This Release

   This is the initial release of Hue Version 3.7 for the MapR
   Distribution for Apache Hadoop.

   It includes the following features in addition to those listed in the
   [6]release notes for Version 3.7:
     * With Hbase 0.98.7 or above, the Hbase Browser displays the MapR
       file system directories and MapR Database tables. For more
       information, see MapR's Hue documentation for Managing MapR
       Database Tables in Hue 3.x.
     * With MapR 4.0.2 or above, Hue supports MapR-SASL security with
       JobTracker. For more information, see MapR's Hue documentation to
       Configure Hue to use MapR-SASL.

   Note: This version of Hue does not support Sentry.

Patches

     * MapR-17314:When you run Hue 3.7 with a Hadoop version that is less
       than 2.5.1, the Job Browser hangs if you attempt to kill running
       YARN applications from the Job Browser window. This issue occurs
       with MapR version 4.0.1 as it uses Hadoop 2.4.1.
     * MapR-17229: The HBase examples provided in Hue 3.7 will not load in
       HBase 0.94.x because HBase 0.94.x uses a different thrift version
       than Hue 3.7.
     * MapR-17533: You cannot view task logs in the Job Browser when you
       run Hue 3.7 with a secure MapR cluster. Instead, you can view the
       task logs in the hadoop user logs directory
       (/opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-<version>/logs/userlogs).
