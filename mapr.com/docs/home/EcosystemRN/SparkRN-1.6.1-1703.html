Known Issues and Limitations

     * To integrate Spark 1.6.1 with MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka,
       you must install the latest Kafka 0.9.0.0 package.
     * Full support of MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka is available only
       on clusters with MapR 5.2 and later.
     * MAPR-17271: On secure clusters, the MapR Control System (MCS) does
       not display links for Spark-Master and Spark-HistoryServer.
     * MAPR-19761: On a secure cluster, MapR software does not support the
       Spark SQL Thrift JDBC server. When the cluster is secure, the Spark
       Thrift server will not start.
     * Spark versions up to and including 2.3.0 have the following
       security vulnerability: [8]CVE-2018-1334 Apache Spark local
