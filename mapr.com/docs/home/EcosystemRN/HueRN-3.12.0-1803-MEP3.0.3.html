Known Issues and Limitations

     * MapR does not support the integration between Hue 3.12.0 and the
       following components:
          + Solr Search
          + ZooKeeper
     * Integration between Hue 3.12.0 and Sentry 1.7 is supported on
       secure clusters that use Kerberos authentication, but it is not
       supported on secure clusters that use MapR-SASL authentication.
     * MAPR-2561: DB Query in Hue cannot execute more than one query.
     * HUE-6074: [notebook] Execute snippets as Oozie batch.
     * MAPR-28087: Livy cannot use the Hive Interpreter. To work around
       this issue, use cluster mode. Set livy.spark.deployMode=cluster in
       {LIVY_CONF}/livy.conf. This issue is caused by Spark 11851 ("Unable
       to start spark thrift server against secured hive metastore(GSS
       initiate failed").

   Note: Hue uses [6]python parquet lib to read the parquet files. This
   library does not support all possible parquet formats.

Resolved Issues

     * None.
