New in this Release

   Drill 1.14.0 includes the following new features and improvements:

   Query Planning
          The query planner in Drill can leverage indexes created on MapR
          Database JSON document fields with array fields. See [4]Writing
          Drill Queries that Leverage Indexes on Array Fields. (MD-3742)
          When you query a view created on a MapR Database table, the
          query planner in Drill creates the same query plan it would
          create if you ran the underlying query directly against the MapR
          Database table. (MD-3360, MD-3313)

   SQL
          Drill supports lateral joins. You must enable the lateral join
          functionality in Drill. See [5]Lateral Join.
          The DECIMAL data type is enabled by default and has [6]enhanced
          support. (MD-3522, MD-1138, MD-640)
          Hive schema and table names are case-insensitive. See
          [7]Case-Sensitivity. (MD-948)
          Support for the ANY_VALUE function; based on [8]CALCITE-2366.
          (MD-4498)
          Drill allows comparisons between date and timestamp values.
          (MD-4220)

   Resource management
          Drill can directly manage the CPU resources through the Drill
          start-up script, drill-env.sh. See [9]Configuring cgroups to
          Control CPU Usage. (MD-3862)

   Storage plugin management
          Ability to [10]export and save your storage plugin
          configurations to a JSON file for reuse. (MD-4621)
          Ability to manage storage plugin configurations in the Drill
          configuration file [11]storage-plugins-override.conf. (MD-2732)

   Integration with Hive and Hue
          Hue integration with Drill is officially supported. See
          [12]Integrate Hue with Drill. (MD-2382)
          Ability to specify Hive properties at the session level through
          the store.hive.conf.properties option. See [13]Setting Hive
          Properties. (MD-4370)
          A new option,
          store.hive.maprdb_json.optimize_scan_with_native_reader, enables
          Drill to use the native Drill reader to read Hive MapR Database
          JSON tables. When you enable this option, Drill typically
          performs faster reads of data and applies filter pushdown
          optimizations. See [14]SET maprdb Format Plugin Options.
          (MD-3662)

   Parquet filter pushdown and partition pruning
          Drill can [15]infer filter conditions for join queries and push
          the filter conditions down to the data source. (MD-3542,
          MD-2181, MD-1399, MD-1272)
          [16]Parquet filter pushdown pushes filters past the ITEM
          operator; useful for queries on complex fields. (MD-1271)
          Parquet performance improvements. (MD-2518, MD-1582)
          Drill uses a native reader to read Hive tables when the
          [17]store.hive.optimize_scan_with_native_readers option is
          enabled; Drill reads data faster and applies filter pushdown
          optimizations. (MD-1267)
          Drill can pushdown filters into the Systems table. (MD-4055)

   Query profiles
          Profiles in Drill show the amount of memory used by the
          Unordered Receiver operator. (MD-4260)

   Drivers
          Drill 1.14 requires new versions of the ODBC and JDBC drivers.
          You can download previews of the MapR [18]ODBC and [19]JDBC
          drivers for Drill 1.14. Earlier versions of the drivers do not
          work with Apache Drill 1.14.

   For a list of additional features and improvements, see the [20]Apache
   Drill 1.14 Release Notes.

Default Configuration Changes

   Note the following changes to default configurations in Drill 1.14.0:
     * Warden manages memory as a percentage of total system memory. See
       [21]Configuring Drill Memory. (MD-2850)
     * [22]Spillable operators spill data to the /tmp/drill/spill
       directory on the MapR Filesystem. You can override this setting in
       drill-override.conf. Refer to the examples in
       drill-override-example.conf. (MD-4775)
     * Query profile data is stored in maprfs:///apps/drill/profiles. The
       drill-override.conf file includes the
       sys.store.provider.zk.blobroot property that you can use to
       override the default location. See [23]Configuring the ZooKeeper
       PStore Location. (MD-3527)
