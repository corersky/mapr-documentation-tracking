Known Issues and Limitations

     * Hue integration with Spark is an experimental feature.
     * The Livy version is a snapshot. Livy is supported only for use with
       Hue. The Livy home directory is
       /opt/mapr/hue-livy/hue-livy-3.10.0/.
     * MapR does not support the integration between Hue 3.10.0 and the
       following components:
          + Solr Search
          + ZooKeeper
     * Integration between Hue 3.10.0 and Sentry 1.6 is supported on
       secure clusters that use Kerberos authentication, but it is not
       supported on secure clusters that use MapR-SASL authentication.
     * MapR-18668: Hue does not work on RedHat 7 / CentOS 7 / SuSE 12 when
       it is configured to use a MySQL database. When this issue occurs,
       the MapR Control System (MCS) displays the "Hue Down Alarm." Use
       this workaround:
         1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the RedHat 6
            compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d-
-f2)/rhel7-amd64/rpms/MariaDB-$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d-
-f2)-centos7-x86_64-compat.rpm

         2. Run the following commands to reconfigure Hue:
cd /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.12.0/
source ./build/env/bin/activate
hue syncdb --noinput
hue migrate
deactivate
         3. Run the following command to restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <node_with_hue>

   Note: Hue uses [6]python parquet lib to read the parquet files. This
   library does not support all possible parquet formats.

Resolved Issues

   None.
