New in this Release

   Sqoop2 addresses security concerns by introducing Admin and Operator
   roles. In Sqoop2, create access for Connections is restricted to Admins
   and execute access is limited to Operators.

   Here are some other differences between Sqoop and Sqoop2:
     * Connectors are no longer restricted to the JDBC model - they can
       define their own vocabulary
     * Sqoop2 offers a REST API for operation and management, which
       integrates better with external systems such as Oozie
     * Sqoop2 works with Hue, an interactive web-based UI
     * Sqoop2 is installed and configured server-side, while Sqoop is
       installed and configured client-side.

   For a comprehensive list of differences between Sqoop and Sqoop2, see
   MapR's Sqoop2 documentation.
