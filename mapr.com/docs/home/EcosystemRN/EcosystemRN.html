Ecosystem Component Release Notes

   The following release notes contain information for the components
   included in the MapR Converged Data Platform.
   Note these considerations for using MapR release notes:
     * MapR release notes contain MapR-specific information; they do not
       duplicate release note information on open-source websites.
     * MapR release notes are not necessarily cumulative in nature. For
       example, if you need to upgrade from version 1.x of a MapR product
       to version 4.x, be sure to review the release notes for versions
       2.x, 3.x, and 4.x to become familiar with new features and known
       issues that might be relevant to version 4.x.
     * To view individual product versions organized by MEP and MapR Core
       version, see [1]Component Versions for Released MEPs.
