Feature Support

     * MapR supports Hive-2.1.1 on Tez-0.8.4.
     * MapR does not support Hive on Spark. Therefore, you cannot use
       Spark as an execution engine for Hive. However, you can run Hive
       and Spark on the same cluster. You can also use Spark SQL and Drill
       to query Hive tables.
     * MapR does not support HDFS encryption in Hive tables.
     * MapR does not support Hbase-0.9X with Hive-2.1.1. Only Hbase-1.X is
       compatible with Hive-2.1.1.
     * MapR does not support LLAP with Hive-2.1.1 since Apache Slider is
       not in MapR ecosystem.
     * Starting from Hive 2.1, Hive needs to run the schematool command as
       an initialization step.

New Features

     * Includes Hive support for MapR-DB JSON tables.
     * Includes MapR-SASL as default security for HiveServer 2 and Hive
       Metastore on secure cluster.
