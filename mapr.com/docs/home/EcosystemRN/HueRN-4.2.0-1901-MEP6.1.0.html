Known Issues and Limitations

     * MapR does not support the integration between Hue 4.2.0 and the
       following components:
          + Solr Search
          + ZooKeeper
     * Integration between Hue 4.2.0 and Sentry 1.7 is supported on secure
       clusters that use Kerberos authentication, but it is not supported
       on secure clusters that use MapR-SASL authentication.
     * MAPR-2561: DB Query in Hue cannot execute more than one query.
     * MAPR-28087: Livy cannot use the Hive Interpreter. To work around
       this issue, use the cluster mode. Set livy.spark.deployMode=cluster
       in the {LIVY_CONF}/livy.conf file. This issue is caused by Spark
       11851: "Unable to start spark thrift server against secured hive
       metastore(GSS initiate failed)".
     * MHUE-141 Example MapR Database tables are not downloaded on
       MAPR-SASL cluster.
     * MHUE-158 Error when change timezone in Oozie coordinator.
     * HUE-7712 Livy-batch not available in HUE 4.1.
     * MHUE-187 R session for R Editor in Hue cannot start.
     * MHUE-192 Error, when create Impala table via Table Browser.
     * MHUE-206 ERROR "Failed to extract json message" when try to export
       Hive query result to ADLS.
     * MHUE-209 Hue cannot create a table from *.csv file via importer
       from ADLS.

   Note: Hue uses [10]python parquet lib to read parquet files. This
   library does not support all possible parquet formats.
     * LIVY-42: Livy UI is not accessible on Kerberos.

Resolved Issues

     * None.
