New in this Release

       MEP 4.0.0. The Thrift and REST server packages are still available
       to support MapR Database binary tables.
     * MapR-SASL authentication, encryption, and impersonation for HBase
       Thrift Gateway are enabled by default on secure clusters.
     * On a secure cluster, by default, HBase REST and HBase Thrift read
       the ssl-client.xml file and configure SSL using this file.
     * PAM authentication, encryption, and impersonation for HBase REST
       are enabled by default on secure clusters.

   Note: HBase Master and HBase Regionserver are still available for
   previous MEP releases.
