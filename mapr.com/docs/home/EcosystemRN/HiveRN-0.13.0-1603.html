Feature Support

   MapR does not support Hive on Spark. Therefore, you cannot use Spark as
   an execution engine for Hive. However, you can run Hive and Spark on
   the same cluster. You can also use Spark SQL and Drill to query Hive
   tables.

   69487f5 2016-03-28 MAPR-22945: HiveServer2 no longer fails to start
   when PAM authentication is enabled.
   11efd3f 2016-03-25 MAPR-22928: The datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll

   145d027 2016-02-19 MAPR-22677: Backported HIVE-8320 and HIVE-4625 so

       if the Hive Metastore is being used in embedded mode
     * Hiveserver2 session is called multiple times

   mechanisms is no longer determined incorrectly on MapR 4.0.1.
