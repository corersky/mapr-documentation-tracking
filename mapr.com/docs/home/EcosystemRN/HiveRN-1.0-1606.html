   Commit Date (YYYY-MM-DD) Comment
   2e82bd5 2016-06-09 HIVE-9839: If a HiveSQLException is thrown during a
   query, the opHandle is cleaned up if the query is synchronous and for
   asynchronous queries, the opHandle is retained and passed back for
   reporting errors.
   9f51e20 2016-06-09 HIVE-12766: The objects created by Tez/Yarn will now
   be freed as TezTask will now close DagClient after execution.
   c1b67e6 2016-06-06 MAPR-23560: Symbolic links to the PID files to track
   memory utilization of HiveServer2 and HiveMetaStore processes are now
   available in /opt/mapr/pid.
   9678f87 2016-06-02 MAPR-23029: Changed the Primary Key for table
   PARTITION_STATS_V2 from varchar(4000) to varchar(3072) as MySQL does
   not support varchar(4000) as Primary Key.
   863c1a 2016-05-18 MAPR-21786: The issue with incorrect permissions
   (because of the fix for MAPR-19894) resulting in “Operation not
   permitted” error is now fixed.
