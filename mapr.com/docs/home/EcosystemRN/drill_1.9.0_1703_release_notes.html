   Issue Description
   MD-1256 The MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION variable in drill-env.sh needs to
   be unset so that a user other than the mapr user can connect to Drill

   MD-1229 Hive table partition pruning does not prune out all unnecessary
   partitions in some scenarios.
   MD-1226 MapR-SASL plain authentication goes through Kerberos, by

   queries where the predicate contains the TIME data type.
