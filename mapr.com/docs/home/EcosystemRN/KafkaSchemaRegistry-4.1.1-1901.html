New in This Release

     * This release is the first MapR release of Kafka Schema Registry for
       MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka.
     * This feature is presented as a developer preview. Developer
       previews are not tested for production environments, and should be
       used with caution.
     * Because it is a developer preview feature, the Kafka Schema
       Registry is not provided in the MEP 6.1 repository. You must
       download the packages from
       [5]https://package.mapr.com/labs/kafka-schema-registry. Using the
       MapR Installer to install the Kafka Schema Registry is not
       currently supported.
     * For more information, see [6]Kafka Schema Registry.
