Noteworthy New Features

   This release introduces the following enhancements:
     * Improved Memory Allocator - Drill uses a new allocator that
       improves an operatorâ€™s use of direct memory and tracks the memory
       use more accurately. See [4]Configuring Drill Memory.
     * Configurable Caching of Hive Metadata - You can now configure the
       TTL for the Hive metadata client cache depending on how frequently
       the Hive metadata is updated. See [5]Hive Metadata Caching.

   See [6]Apache Drill 1.5.0 Release Notes for a complete list of JIRAs
   resolved in the 1.5.0 release.
