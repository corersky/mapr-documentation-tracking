Known Issues

     * MapR-17314:When you run Hue 3.7 with a Hadoop version that is less
       than 2.5.1, the Job Browser hangs if you attempt to kill running
       YARN applications from the Job Browser window. This issue occurs
       with MapR version 4.0.1 as it uses Hadoop 2.4.1.
     * MapR-17229: The HBase examples provided in Hue 3.7 will not load in
       HBase 0.94.x because HBase 0.94.x uses a different thrift version
       than Hue 3.7.
