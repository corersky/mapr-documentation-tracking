   Hadoop. This release of Spark has backward-compatibility changes, see
   the open-source [1]Spark 2.1.0 Release Notes for more information.

   These release notes contain only MapR-specific information and are not
   necessarily cumulative in nature. For information about how to use the

   Important:
     * Spark 2.2 can connect to Hive Metastore 2.1. But, features of Hive
       added after Hive 1.2 are not supported by Spark.
     * Starting from Spark 2.2.1 and MEP 5.0.0 Kafka version is updated to
       1.0.1.
     * Spark Yarn and Standalone modes are supported only on clusters in
       MRv2 (YARN) mode. It is not supported on clusters in MRv1 (classic)
       mode.
     * MapR 6.0 and MEP 5.0 and later introduce [7]security by default. If
       you are using these versions and enable security on your MapR
       cluster, MapR scripts automatically configure Spark security
       features.

   This version of Spark supports integration with Hive. However, note the
   following exceptions:
     * Hive-on-Spark is not supported.
     * Spark-SQL is supported, but it is not fully compatible with Hive.
