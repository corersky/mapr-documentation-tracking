New in This Release

   Important: Note these considerations for Hue 3.10.0:
     * The Livy version is a snapshot. Livy is supported only for use with
       Hue.
     * MapR does not support the integration between Hue 3.10.0 and the
       following components:
          + Solr Search
          + Zookeeper
     * Integration between Hue 3.10.0 and Sentry 1.6 is supported on
       secure clusters that use Kerberos authentication, but it is not
       supported on secure clusters that use MapR-SASL authentication.

   The following are new in this release:
     * Support for Spark 2.0.1. Hue integration with Spark is an
       experimental feature.
     * Support for Sqoop2 1.99.7.
     * Livy is moved to its own directory:
/opt/mapr/hue-livy/hue-livy-3.10.0/

Known Issues and Limitations

     * MAPR-18668: Hue does not work on RedHat/CentOS 7 when it is
       configured to use a MySQL database. When this issue occurs, the
       MapR Control System (MCS) displays the "Hue Down Alarm." Use this
       workaround:
         1. Run the following commands to install MariaDB and the RedHat 6
            compatibility library:
yum install mariadb
rpm -ivh --nodeps http://yum.mariadb.org/$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d-
-f2)/rhel7-amd64/rpms/MariaDB-$(rpm -qa mariadb|cut -d-
-f2)-centos7-x86_64-compat.rpm

         2. Run the following command to create a symlink for the Cyrus
            SASL library:
ln -s /lib64/libsasl2.so.3.0.0 /lib64/libsasl2.so.2
         3. Run the following commands to reconfigure Hue:
source /opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.10.0/build/env/bin/activate
/opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.10.0/build/env/bin/hue syncdb --noinput
/opt/mapr/hue/hue-3.10.0/build/env/bin/hue migrate

         4. Run the following command to restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <space separated list of
hostnames>
       Note: Hue uses the [7]python parque lib to read the parquet files,
       and this library doesn't support all possible parquet formats.
