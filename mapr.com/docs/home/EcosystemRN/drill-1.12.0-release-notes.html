New in this Release

     * (MD-1649) Index-based query plans for queries without filters,
       including queries with GROUP BY, JOIN, and DISTINCT projections.
       See [5]Index Planning in Drill.
     * (MD-2301) Ability to submit queries from the REST API when
       impersonation is enabled and authentication is disabled. See
       [6]Submitting Queries.
     * (MD-2745) Support for NaN (Not-a-Number) and Infinity (both
       POSITIVE and NEGATIVE) as numeric values. See [7]JSON Data Model.
     * (MD-2490, DRILL-5723) System options improvements, including a new
       internal system options table.

Default Configuration Changes

   The default size for the store.parquet.block-size parameter is now
   268435456 (256 MB), the same size as MapR file system chunk sizes.
   Previously, the default size was 536870912 (512 MB). See [8]Configuring
   the Parquet Block Size for more information.

Improvements

   In addition to the features mentioned above, Drill 1.12 includes the
   following improvements:
   MapR Tracking Numbers Improvements

   MD-3365
   Bounds checking for direct memory is now disabled by default. You can
   enable bounds checking, as explained in [9]Configuring Drill Memory.
   MD-3314 Unable to re-run queries from Profiles tab with impersonation
   and without authentication
   MD-3086 Improve the row count estimates for LIMIT queries to avoid
   over-parallelization
   MD-3053 MapR Database Statistics Improvements
   MD-2867 DRILL-5855 Provide a useful error message when the
   SystemOptionManager is queried for a non-existent option
   MD-2842 Projecting a Few Columns with DISTINCT, LIMIT and ORDER BY
   without a Filter Specified should use a Secondary Index Tables for Fast
   Query Response Times
   MD-2758 Drill performance improvement for text search vs Impala
   MD-2745 Error parsing JSON containing token 'NaN'
   MD-2647 Enable UTF-8 support in query string by default
   MD-2518 Parquet Scan Performance Improvement
   MD-2403 Drillbit fails to start when only keystore path is provided
   without keystore password.
   MD-2323 Review & update the default values of index planning config
   options
   MD-2319 Query Containing Wildcard in String Matching Filter Runs 4x
   Slower Than Impala
   MD-2301 Support Impersonation without authentication for REST API
   MD-2196 DRILL-4264: Allow field names to include dots
   MD-2002 Operator Specific Handle for Empty Batches
   MD-1752 Throttling-based per-query memory assignment
   MD-1650 Drill Join query with Secondary indexes
   MD-1649, MD-3267 Support Index Planning for Queries with GROUP BY w/o
   WHERE clause
   MD-1431 Improve Performance of Drill's Parquet Scan Operator (Amadeus)
   MD-1247, MD-1810 Drill only initializes enabled storage plugins and
   registers schemas for workspaces that relate directly to a query, which
   improves query time for small queries that run concurrently. The
   Foreman in Drill caches the root schema of the JSON document for use in
   subsequent queries. Previously, Drill initialized all enabled storage
   plugins and registered workspace schemas for each query without caching
   the root schema, which caused an increase in query time if a storage
   plugin was misconfigured or the underlying data source was down or
   slow.
   MD-580 Improve performance of Parquet scan operator
   For a list of additional features and improvements, see [10]Apache
   Drill 1.12 Release Notes.

Patches

   None

Limitation

   (Ubuntu systems only) If you uninstall Drill 1.11 or upgrade from Drill
   1.11 to Drill 1.12, you must manually backup log files, third-party JAR
   files, and configuration files and settings prior to performing the
   uninstall or upgrade procedure. Failure to do so results in the loss of
   the files and configurations.
