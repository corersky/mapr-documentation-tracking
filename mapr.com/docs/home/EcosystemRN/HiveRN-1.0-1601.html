Feature Support

   MapR does not support Hive on Spark. Therefore, you cannot use Spark as
   an execution engine for Hive. However, you can run Hive and Spark on
   the same cluster. You can also use Spark SQL and Drill to query Hive
   tables.

   release. For complete details, refer to the commit log for this project
