Fixes

   Drill 1.13.0-1901 provides the following fixes:
   Fix Tracking Number Description
   MD-5379 DRILL-7018: Fixed Parquet buffer overflow when reading
   timestamp column.
   MD-5062 DRILL-6664: Drill returns the same results for queries on the
   same column of a Parquet table with the same predicate.
   MD-5019 DRILL-6797: Drill aggregation queries that use custom UDF to
   split column data in a Parquet file no longer fail with a compilation
   error if the filter criteria results in no rows.
   MD-5014 DRILL-6776: The Drill Web UI page source no longer has links to
   external sites.
   MD-5008

   Drill can leverage indexes for queries with ORDER BY DESC on indexed
   columns; for example, if a secondary index is defined on column a,
   Drill leverages the index for the query:

   SELECT a FROM t ORDER BY a DESC;
   MD-4936 DRILL-6773: Queries, with column aliases, that returned
   inconsistent results after a Drill patch was applied no longer return
   inconsistent results.
   MD-4851 Drill queries on MapRDB JSON tables no longer fail on schema
   change when the only distinct values are null and text.
   MD-4780 DRILL-6746: Queries no longer hang when one of the nodes
   encounters a connection error.
