   CAPTION:

   Version 1.1.0
   Release Date December 2018
   MapR Version Interoperability Compatible with MapR 5.2.2 or later.
   Note: If your installation requires MapR and Kubernetes software to
   coexist on the same nodes, you must use one of these versions:
     * Version 1.0.1 with MapR 6.0.1 or later
     * Version 1.1.0 with MapR 6.1.0 or later

   OS Compatibility The operating system (OS) on a node where the volume
   plug-in is installed must be a supported OS for the MapR version. For a
   list of supported OS versions, see [2]Operating System Support Matrix
   (MapR 6.x).
   Kubernetes Compatibility Kubernetes 1.9 or later.
   Note: Kubernetes alpha features are not supported.

New in This Release

   Version 1.1.0 of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes includes a new
   plug-in and provisioner and uses the updated version of the FUSE POSIX
   client included in MapR 6.1.0. Version 1.1.0 can be used on cluster
   nodes that:
     * Are installed with MapR software only (MapR 5.2.2 or later)
     * Have both MapR software (MapR 6.1.0 or later) and Kubernetes
       software

   This release of the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes includes a set of
   Docker containers and their respective .yaml configuration files that
   can be installed onto a Kubernetes cluster. Once installed, these
   containers provide a Kubernetes FlexVolume Driver for MapR Filesystem
   and a Kubernetes Dynamic Volume Provisioner that permit static and
   dynamic provisioning of MapR storage from Kubernetes.

   To upgrade a previously installed version of the plug-in and
   provisioner to version 1.1.0, see [9]Upgrading the MapR Data Fabric for
   Kubernetes.

Patches

   None.

Known Issues and Limitations

   Note these limitations:
     * Installations that require MapR and Kubernetes software to coexist
       on the same nodes must use one of the following:
          + Version 1.0.1 with MapR 6.0.1 or later
          + Version 1.1.0 with MapR 6.1.0 or later
     * All nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must use the same Linux OS.
       Configuration files are available to support these Linux
       distributions:
          + CentOS
          + RedHat (use CentOS configuration file)
          + SSE (use CentOS configuration file)
          + Ubuntu
     * Docker for Mac with Kubernetes is not supported as a development
       platform for containers used with the MapR Data Fabric for
       Kubernetes.
     * Volume plug-in files are supported for:
          + CentOS
          + Ubuntu
          + Microsoft Azure AKS
          + Red Hat OpenShift**
          + Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
     * Amazon EKS is not supported.
     * The Basic POSIX client package is included by default when you
       install the MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes. The Platinum POSIX
       client can be enabled by specifying a parameter in the Pod spec.
       Only the POSIX client is supported. NFSv3 is not supported.

   **OpenShift Origin is supported because it supports Kubernetes 1.9. The
   OpenShift Container Platform (formerly known as OpenShift Enterprise)
   can be used only if it supports Kubernetes 1.9 or later.

Resolved Issues

   CAPTION:

   Issue Description
   K8S-310 Node restart causes the KDF driver to not update the volume
   mount.
   K8S-315 Version 1.1.0 uses the FUSE POSIX client included in MapR
   6.1.0.
   K8S-332 On an upgrade from a previous version of the volume plug-in,
   POSIX can fail with the following error in the POSIX log file:
   Create/Attach to stats shared memory failed.
   K8S-353 Kubelet restart causes the existing volume mount to fail.
   K8S-362 Version 1.1.0 provides compatibility with MapR 6.1.0 or earlier
   volume attributes, as provided in the storage class.
   K8S-399 Version 1.1.0 provides ReadWriteMany support with the KDF
   volume driver.
