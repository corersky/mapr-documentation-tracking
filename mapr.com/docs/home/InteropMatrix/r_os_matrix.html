   ^1MapReduce (MRv1) metrics are supported only on Red Hat/CentOS 6.
   MapReduce (MRv1) metrics are not installable on SUSE or RedHat / CentOS
   7.

   ^2MapR Installer 1.9 and earlier are not supported on Red Hat 7.5 or
   CentOS 7.5 with MapR 5.2.2. Before upgrading your operating system to
   Red Hat 7.5 or CentOS 7.5, be sure to update the MapR Installer to
   version 1.10 or later. See [1]Updating the MapR Installer.

   ^3If you are installing MapR on CentOS Version 6.3 or earlier, see the
   Known Issues section in the [2]Release Notes.

   ^4Secure MapR clusters are not supported on SuSe 11 platforms.

   ^5MapR 5.2 and 5.1 support Oracle Enterprise Linux for Core
   installations only. Ecosystem components are not supported.

   ^6 MapR 5.0 supports RHEL/CentOS 7.0, but service management with
   systemd is not supported. Starting in RHEL/CentOS 7.0, systemd was
   included alongside the legacy process manager, initd, but was not
   enabled by default. In RHEL/CentOS 7.1, systemd became the default.
   Some RHEL/CentOS 7.0 ISOs may have a different default for systemd
   (on), but these will not work with MapR 5.0. Service management
   integration with systemd is only supported if you install MapR 5.1 or
   5.2 on RHEL/CentOS 7.1. Customers who encounter issues with systemd
   support may choose to disable systemd on RHEL/CentOS 7.0 nodes,
   downgrade to RHEL/CentOS 6.x, or upgrade to MapR 5.1 or 5.2.
   ^7MapR does not support RedHat when its kernel patch level is below
   kernel-2.6.32-504.16.2.el6. Patch levels below
   kernel-2.6.32-504.16.2.el6 include Linux kernel 3.14-3.17, which has a
   [3]bug that may cause the following issues:
     * Lost wake-ups between process threads.
     * MapR processes hang.

   For more information, see
   [4]https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0864.html.
   Tip: You can run the following command to determine the kernel patch
   level of your operating system: uname -r

   ^8Not supported in MapR Installer
