   *Rolling upgrades from MapR 5.2.x to MapR 6.0 or later require the
   cluster to be running MEP 3.0.1 or later. For upgrade purposes, MEPs
   3.0.1 or later can coexist temporarily with MapR 6.x. After MapR Core
   is upgraded to MapR 6.x, all nodes must be upgraded to MEP 4.0 or later
   before MapR 6.x features are enabled. For more information, see
   [2]Planning the MapR Core Upgrade.
