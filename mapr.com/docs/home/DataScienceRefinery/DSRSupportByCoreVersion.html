MapR Data Science Refinery Support by MapR Core Version

   This topic provides general guidance for which versions of MapR Core
   you can use with which versions of MapR Data Science Refinery. It also
   lists features that are exceptions to the general rule.

   Each MapR Data Science Refinery release has a corresponding MapR
   Expansion Pack (MEP) release:
   MapR Data Science Refinery Version Number Corresponding MEP Version
   1.3                                       6.0.0
   1.2                                       5.0.0
   1.1                                       4.1.0
   1.0                                       4.0.0

   In addition, each MapR Core version supports a set of MEP releases.
   [1]MEP Support by MapR Core Version shows the support matrix.

   In general, you can use MapR Data Science Refinery with the MapR Core
   version supported by the corresponding MEP release, as well as newer
   MapR Core versions. For example, because MapR Data Science Refinery 1.3
   corresponds with MEP 6.0, which supports MapR Core 6.1, unless
   otherwise noted, you can use MapR Data Science Refinery 1.3 to access a
   MapR 6.1 (or later) cluster.

   However, there are some exceptions to this general guidance. Some
   Zeppelin interpreters do not support certain features when using
   specific MapR Core versions. The following table highlights those
   exceptions. It includes the version combinations, which are supported
   for those exception features, to show which MapR Core version you need
   to use.
