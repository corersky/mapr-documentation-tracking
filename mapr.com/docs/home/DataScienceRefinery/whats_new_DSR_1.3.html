What's New in MapR Data Science Refinery 1.3

   MapR Data Science Refinery 1.3 introduces new features and some changes
   in behavior for existing features from prior releases. This release
   requires that you connect to a MapR 6.1.0 (or later) cluster.

New Features

   The following are new features in this release:

   Interpreter Lifecycle Management
          Prior to the 1.3 release, if a Zeppelin interpreter is idle and
          using excessive resources, you must either restart or kill the
          interpreter to reclaim resources. Starting in 1.3, MapR Data
          Science Refinery terminates interpreters that have been idle for
          an hour. You can configure this timeout threshold. See [1]Idle
          Interpreter Timeout Threshold for details.

   Helium Repository Browser
          Starting with the 1.3 release, MapR Data Science Refinery
          supports the Helium repository browser for enabling Zeppelin
          visualization packages. This provides a simpler procedure for
          enabling these packages. See [2]Using Visualization Packages in
          Zeppelin for detailed instructions.

   Configuration Storage
          Starting with the MapR Data Science Refinery 1.3 release, you
          can store certain Zeppelin configuration files in MapR
          Filesystem, which enables you to share them across multiple
          containers. See [3]Configuration Storage for more details.

   Default Drill JDBC Connection String
          Starting with MapR Data Science Refinery 1.3, you can configure
          the default Drill JDBC connection URL. See [4]Default Drill JDBC
          Connection URL for more information.

   Building your own Docker Image
          Starting with the 1.3 release, you can build your own custom
          Docker image of MapR Data Science Refinery. See [5]Building your
          own MapR Data Science Refinery Docker Image for more
          information.

Changes in Existing Features

   The following describe changes in behavior from prior releases:

   YARN Cluster Mode for Spark Interpreter Jobs
          Prior to the 1.3 release, Spark interpreter jobs run in YARN
          client mode. The interpreter now runs in cluster mode. This mode
          reduces Spark resource utilization on the host machine of your
          MapR Data Science Refinery container. See [6]Understanding
          Zeppelin Interpreters - Spark for details.

   Shared Livy Sessions
          In prior releases, the Livy interpreter uses separate Livy
          sessions for Spark, PySpark, and SparkR jobs. Starting in the
          1.3 release, it uses a shared Livy session to run all Spark
          variations. This reduces resource utilization in your MapR
          cluster.

   Sequential Execution of Notebook Paragraphs
          Starting with the 1.3 release, MapR Data Science Refinery runs
          paragraphs in a notebook sequentially rather than in parallel.
          This allows paragraphs to run properly when they have
          dependencies on earlier paragraphs in the same notebook.

   Hive JDBC Interpreter and Secure MapR Clusters
          Starting with the 1.3 release, you must specify ssl=true in your
          Hive JDBC URL when connecting to a secure MapR cluster. See
          [7]Hive JDBC for an example.

   Python Versions with the Livy Interpreter
          Starting with the 1.3 release, you no longer can run both Python
          2 and Python 3 with the Livy interpreter. You can run only one
          or the other. By default, the interpreter runs Python 2. To
          switch to Python 3, see [8]Python Version.

          The limitation also applies if you are installing custom Python
          packages. See [9]Installing Custom Packages for PySpark Using
          Conda for instructions on how to install Python 2 vs Python 3
          custom packages.

   Running Zeppelin as a Kubernetes Service
          The DEPLOY_MODE parameter is your Kubernetes pod manifest file
          has been renamed to ZEPPELIN_DEPLOY_MODE. You can still use
          DEPLOY_MODE, but MapR Data Science Refinery 1.3 returns a
          warning, indicating the parameter is deprecated. See [10]Running
          Zeppelin as a Kubernetes Service for an example of a pod
          manifest file.

   Notebook Storage Using MapR Filesystem
          Starting with the 1.3 release, to store your notebooks in MapR
          Filesystem, you no longer need to use the FUSE-based POSIX
          client. See [11]Notebook Storage for details.
