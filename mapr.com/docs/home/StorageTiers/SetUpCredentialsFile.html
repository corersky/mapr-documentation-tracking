Setting up a Credentials File for Connecting to a Cold Tier Using the CLI or
REST API

   Set up a credentials file on the host you plan to use for creating the
   cold tier if you are planning on using the credential option (and not
   pass the credentials on the command-line using the credential_str
   option).

   For example, your credentials.txt file should look similar to the
   following sample file:
{
      "bucketName" : "defaultbucket3",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "credentials" : {
         "accessKey" : "AB956CDE8F2GO7H9I4J2",
         "secretKey" : "5K1LmN92e65oPQRsTUvOfSbURxyEtYl2MmAocGi"
      }
}

   The credentials file (.txt file) contains the following properties in
   JSON format:

   bucketName
          The name of the bucket on the tier. If the bucket does not
          already exist on the tier, the command to create the tier
          attempts to create the bucket using the credentials in the
          credentials file. This can be modified only by using the -force
          option with the [1]tier modify command.

   region
          The S3 region to create the bucket on. Use the information in
          the following table to specify region information.

   CAPTION:

   Vendor Default Value Notes
   AWS us-east-1 Specify region information as defined [2]here.

   On AWS, each region can have a different URL. The URL must be provided
   with the maprcli tier create command.
   Note: Because bucket names are unique across regions, make sure you
   specify the correct region for a given bucket in the credentials file.
   For example, suppose a bucket called myBucket3 in us-east-1; you cannot
   offload data to myBucket3 by specifying us-west-1 as the region in the
   credentials file.
   GCS us-east-1 Specify region information as described [3]here.
   HDP N/A Not required. If specified, MapR ignores the value.
   IBM us-east-region Not required. If specified, MapR ignores the value.
   Azure-Blobs N/A Not required. The region of the storage account is
   determined from the URL and data is offloaded into that region.
   Minio us-east-1 If you specify region, export the MINIO_REGION
   environment variable on the minio server as described in the
   [4]Configuration Guide.
   Scality us-east-region Not required. If specified, MapR ignores the
   value.

          This can be modified only by using the -force option with the
          [5]tier modify command.

   accessKey and secretKey
          The credentials for accessing the tier.

          Tip: For Azure Blobs, the storage account name is the access
          key.

   Note: Once the tier is created, MapR does not require this file because
   CLDB stores the bucket, region, and credentials information.
