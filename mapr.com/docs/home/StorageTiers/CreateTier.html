Creating a Storage Tier

   You can create a tier using the MapR Control System and the CLI.

   When you create a tier, MapR Filesystem creates a volume, whose mount
   point is /var/mapr/tier/mapr.internal.tier.<tiername>, for the tier.
   For warm tier volumes automatically created using the ecenable
   parameter or the MCS, a corresponding tier volume named
   mapr.internal.tier.autoec.<volName>.<creationTime> is, by default,
   created in the /var/mapr/autoectier path. The tier volume is visible
   and stores all the metadata tables and information on all the jobs
   running on the tier. Do not modify, move, or remove this volume.
   Note: If the number of cluster nodes is more than five, by default,
   MapR (through the enforceminreplicationforio parameter) requires
   minimum number of copies of the tier volume for writes to succeed and
   if the number of cluster nodes is less than five, MapR does not enforce
   minimum number of copies for writes to succeed.

Creating a Warm Tier Using the MapR Control System

   When you create a volume enabled for erasure coding, MCS automatically
   creates a warm tier and associates the volume with that tier. See
   [1]Creating a Volume for more information. You cannot create a warm
   tier separately using the MapR Control System.

Creating a Cold Tier Using the MapR Control System

   To create a cold tier:
    1. Log in to MCS, click Data > Volumes, and then do one of the
       following:
          + Go to the Remote Targets tab if you wish to create a remote
            target that is not (yet) associated with a volume.
          + Click Create Volume if you wish to create a remote target for
            a volume when you are creating the volume.
            Note: You must enable data tiering and select Remote Archiving
            (Cold) from the Tiering Type drop-down list to create the
            remote target.
          + Click Edit Volume in the [2]volume information page if you
            want to create a remote target for the volume when you are
            editing the volume settings.
            Note: You can create a remote target only if a remote target
            is already not associated with the volume.
    2. Click one of the following to display the Create Remote Target
       window.
          + Create Target if you are in the Remote Targets tab.
          + Create link associated with the Remote Target field if you are
            in the Create New Volume page.
          + Create link associated with the Remote Target field if you are
            in the Edit Volume page.
    3. Specify a name for the tier in the Remote Target Name field.
    4. Select a topology for the metadata volume associated with the tier
       from the list of topologies in the Lookup Topology drop-down menu.
       The volume stores all the metadata tables and information on all
       the jobs running on the tier. If many volumes share the same tier
       (and thus the same lookup topology), the lookups might have an
       adverse affect by inadvertently adding background load to nodes in
       that topology. This property allows you to setup the lookups on
       other nodes.
    5. Specify the following properties.

   CAPTION:

   Vendor The vendor from the Vendor drop-down list.

   Note: For cold tiering, MapR supports the following vendors:
          + AWS (Amazon AWS)
          + GCS (Google Cloud Platform)
          + HDS (Hitachi HCP)
          + IBM (IBM Cleversafe)
          + Azure Blob (Microsoft Azure)
          + Others (such as Minio)

   See [3]Specifying the Vendor/Object Store for a Cold Tier for more
   information on the supported vendors.
   URL The URL to use to connect to the tier in the following format:
<protocol>://<IP|hostname>.<domain>

   If the protocol is https, the MAST Gateway uses HTTPS to upload data to
   the cold-tier. If the cold-tier storage does not support HTTPS, all
   tier related operations will fail. If the cold tier does not support
   HTTPS, set the protocol to http.

   See [4]Specifying the Vendor/Object Store for a Cold Tier for more
   information on the tier endpoint URLs and supported authentication
   protocols.
   Bucket Name The name of the bucket on the tier. This cannot be modified
   once associated with a tier. If the bucket does not already exist on
   the tier, MapR will attempt to create the bucket.

   Note: For Azure, the bucket/container is created in the region that is
   specified in the parent storage account
   Region The S3 region to create the bucket on. This cannot be modified
   once configured (explicitly or using the default) and associated with a
   tier. See [5]region for more information.
    6. Enter the credentials for accessing the tier in the Access Key and
       Secret Key fields.
       Tip: For Azure Blobs, the storage account name is the access key.
    7. Click Create Target to create the cold tier that you can associate
       with a volume.

Creating a Tier Using the CLI and the REST API

     * [6]CLI
     * [7]REST

   Run the following command to create a tier:
     * Cold tier:
$maprcli tier create -name <tier_name> -type cold -url <tier_url> -credential <c
redentials_file_path>
       For using the -credential option, you must have the credential file
       already set up as described in [8]Setting up a Credentials File for
       Connecting to a Cold Tier Using the CLI or REST API. On the other
       hand, if you do not have the file already set up, use the
       -credential_str option as shown below:
$maprcli tier create -name <tier_name> -type cold -url <tier_url> -credential_st
r '<credential_string>'
     * Warm tier with default values:
$maprcli tier create -name <tier_name> -type ectier
       Note: You can associate the same tier with multiple volumes with
       different erasure coding scheme.

   Send a request of type POST. For example:
     * Cold Tier:
# curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/tier/create?name=egColdTier&type=
cold&url=s3.amazonaws.com&credential=credentials.txt' --user mapr:mapr
{"timestamp":1525724933919,"timeofday":"2018-05-07 01:28:53.919 GMT-0700 PM","st
atus":"OK","total":0,"data":[],"messages":["Successfully created tier: 'egColdTi
er'"]}
     * Warm tier:
# curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/tier/create?name=egWarmTier&type=
ectier' --user mapr:mapr
{"timestamp":1525725105206,"timeofday":"2018-05-07 01:31:45.206 GMT-0700 PM","st
atus":"OK","total":0,"data":[],"messages":["Successfully created tier: 'egWarmTi
er'"]}
       Note: You can associate the same tier with multiple volumes with
       different erasure coding scheme.
