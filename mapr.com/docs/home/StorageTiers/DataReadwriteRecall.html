Data Reads, Writes, and Recalls

   Once offloaded to the storage tier, data is considered to be warm or
   cold on the storage tier, but the data can still be accessed (read,
   written, and recalled).

Read of Tiered Data

   Depending on whether the standard volume data is outside of the MapR
   cluster and in the cloud (cold tiering) or on the MapR cluster (warm
   tiering), MapR processes the request to read standard volume data and
   mirror volume data.
     * [1]Data Reads on Tiering-Enabled Standard Volumes
     * [2]Data Reads on Tiering-Enabled Mirror Volumes

   MapR processes client requests to read standard volume data on the warm
   tier and the cold tier differently.

   Warm Tier
          When a client attempts to read, the read request is first sent
          to the front-end volume and if the data exists in the front-end
          volume, the data is returned from the front-end volume. If data
          is not in the front-end volume, the data is returned from the
          erasure coded volume.

   Cold Tier
          When a client attempts to read, the read request is first sent
          to the volume on the MapR cluster and if the data exists in the
          volume on the cluster, the data is returned from the volume. On
          the other hand, if the data was offloaded, the MAST Gateway
          recalls the data from the cold-tier to process the read request.
          See [3]Recall of Tiered Data for more information on recalled
          data.

   The following illustration shows client sending data read request first
   (#1) to the tiering-enabled volume and the response (#2) being served
   from the volume on the MapR cluster. Then (#3), data is offloaded to
   the back-end erasure coded volume (for Volume A) and to the cloud (for
   Volume B). When the client next sends a read request to the volume on
   the MapR cluster (#4), for:
     * Volume A, the MAST Gateway forwards the request to the back end
       erasure-coded volume (#5) from where data is returned (#6) to the
       client.
     * Volume B, the MAST Gateway recalls the data (#5 and #6) from the
       cloud to the volume on MapR cluster, from where data is returned
       (#7) to the client.

   MapR processes client requests to read mirror volume data on the warm
   tier and the cold tier differently.

   Warm Tier
          When a client attempts to read, the read request is first sent
          to the front-end volume and if the data exists in the front-end
          mirror volume, the data is returned from the front-end volume.
          If data is not in the front-end volume, the data is returned
          from the erasure coded volume.

   Cold Tier
          When a client attempts to read, the read request is first sent
          to the volume on the MapR cluster and if the data exists in the
          volume on the cluster, the data is returned from the volume. On
          the other hand, if the data was offloaded, the MAST Gateway
          recalls or fetches a copy of the data (from the tier) into an
          associated cache-volume, from where data is returned to the
          client. See [4]Recall of Tiered Data for more information on
          recalled data.

   The following illustration shows client sending read request first (#1)
   to the tiering-enabled mirror volume and the response (#2) being served
   from the volume on the MapR cluster. Then (#3), data is offloaded to
   the back-end erasure coded volume (for warm tier) and to the cloud (for
   cold tier). When the client next sends a read request to the volume on
   the MapR cluster (#4), for:
     * Warm tier, data is returned from the back end erasure-coded volume
       (#5).
     * Cold tier, data is recalled in the associated cache-volume (#5 and
       #6), from where data is returned to the client (#7).

   [MirrorDataReads.png]

   The cache-volume named mapr.internal.cv.<volume-name>_<id> is created
   when the tiering-enabled mirror volume is created. Although it may not
   hold any data initially, a copy of the tiered data is fetched into the
   cache-volume whenever there is a read of the cold-tiered mirror volume
   data or explicit recall of (cold or warm) tiered mirror volume data.
   You can use the [5]volume info command on the tiering-enabled mirror
   volume to get the offload stats and recall stats, which are from the
   cache-volume, for the mirror volume.

   The cache-volume has the same replication factor as the mirror volume
   (at the time of volume creation); changes to the mirror volume
   replication factor do not trigger a change to the replication factor of
   the associated cache-volume.

   If the tiering-enabled mirror volume is deleted, the cache-volume is
   also deleted and if the tiering-enabled mirror volume is promoted to a
   read-write volume, the associated cache-volume is deleted.

Write on Tiered Data

   When writes happen, if the write is:
     * An append, new data is offloaded when the data meets the criteria
       in the rule (associated with the volume) for offload.
     * A change to existing data (overwrite), the data is recalled to MapR
       file system to allow the write to succeed and then offloaded when
       the data meets the criteria in the rule (associated with the
       volume) for offload. See [6]Recall of Tiered Data for more
       information on recalled data.

   Note: If cold data is accessed (read/written) frequently, IO to that
   file may suffer large latencies. In such scenarios, recall the whole
   volume or the corresponding files.

Recall of Tiered Data

   Offloaded data is automatically recalled when a client performs a read
   or overwrite on the data in the cold-tier or when a client performs an
   overwrite on the data in the warm-tier. The MAST Gateway fetches a copy
   of the data to allow the operations to succeed. You can also manually
   trigger a recall of:
     * All volume data using the maprcli command or REST API.
       See [7]Recalling a Volume to MapR Filesystem for more information.
     * File using the [8]hadoop command, maprcli command, REST API,
       (loopbacknfs or FUSE-based) POSIX client, or the NFS client.
       See [9]Recalling a File to MapR Filesystem Using the CLI and REST
       API and [10]Running Tiering Commands when maprcli and hadoop
       Commands are not Available for more information.

   Based on the expiration time period set at the volume level for
   recalled data, recalled data is:
     * Offloaded again based on the rules if there are changes to the
       data.
     * Purged when the compactor runs if there are no changes to the data.

   For mirror volumes, when you recall tiered data, data from the tier is
   recalled into an associated cache-volume, which is created at the time
   of the creation of the tiering-enabled mirror volume. For all explicit
   recall of warm-tiered data and explicit and automatic recalls of
   cold-tiered data, the MAST Gateway recalls data into the associated
   cache-volume. The data in the cache-volume is "hot" in the cluster, or
   available for reads, for the duration of the expiry-period. The
   recalled data is purged by the compactor when the expiration time that
   is set at the volume level is reached or has passed.

   If the recall fails, CLDB retries the operation after some time. See
   [11]Retrying Failed Operation for more information.
