Overview of MAST Gateway

   The MAST Gateway can be installed on specific hosts on the MapR cluster
   with access to the the tier. The MAST Gateway acts as the centralized
   entry point for all the operations that need to be performed on the
   tiered storage including the following:
     * [1]Warm Tier
     * [2]Cold Tier

   For volumes configured for warm tiering, the MAST Gateway:
     * Identifies files in the volume that are ready to be offloaded,
       fetches data corresponding to these files from MapR Filesystem, and
       packs this data for offload. It:
          + Identifies and fetches the data to offload.
            It handles both compressed and uncompressed data. Compressed
            data from the file server is transferred and stored as-is on
            the warm tier.
          + Creates stripes based on the erasure coding scheme.
            For example, for an erasure coding scheme of 4+2, the stripe
            depth would be 6x4MB=24MB.
          + Manages statistics on the amount of data offloaded.
          + Prepares a corresponding metadata on the MapR cluster for the
            data.
            The MAST Gateway stores the metadata in MapR Database tables
            in a separate volume associated with the tier.
     * Tracks invalid data and deletes stripelets that are completely
       invalid.
     * Fetches data from the tier.
     * Recalls whole volume from the tier to the MapR cluster.

   For volumes configured for cold tiering, the MAST Gateway:
     * Identifies files in the volume that are ready to be offloaded,
       fetches data corresponding to these files from MapR Filesystem, and
       packs this data for offload. It:
          + Identifies and fetches the data to offload and creates objects
            (including creating new buckets) in the storage tier for the
            data.
          + Manages statistics on the amount of data offloaded.
          + Updates metadata references for remote access.
     * Tracks invalid data and deletes objects that are completely
       invalid.
     * Fetches data from the tier. It:
          + Handles both compressed and uncompressed data. If data on file
            server is compressed, the compressed data is not
            uncompressed/re-compressed during offload or recall.
            Compressed data from the file server is transferred and stored
            as-is on the cold tier.
          + Ensures that data is decrypted, if it is encrypted, before
            forwarding it to MapR Filesystem.
     * Recalls whole volume from the tier to the MapR cluster.

   The MAST Gateway sends heartbeat messages to CLDB every 5 seconds. CLDB
   manages the discovery and a minimal global state of the MAST Gateway
   service. CLDB also manages the volumes and any policy configurations on
   the volumes. When a volume is assigned to a gateway, the volume remains
   assigned to the gateway across CLDB, Gateway, and cluster restarts.
   Volumes are assigned evenly to gateways and CLDB balances the gateway
   load. For more information, see [3]Balancing Gateway Load.

   By default, the MAST Gateway uses 16 threads for volume and file
   offload and recall operations and another 16 threads for handling
   internal operations and other operations such as reads (which triggers
   automatic recall requests), writes, etc. Each thread processes offload
   or recall of a container (associated with a volume). Each MAST Gateway
   can process one or more volumes (and associated containers)
   simultaneously depending on the number of threads available for
   processing the containers associated with the volumes. Each volume is
   assigned to a MAST Gateway for a tiering operation irrespective of the
   number of containers associated with the volume.

   When a MAST Gateway goes down during a volume-level offload, CLDB does
   not immediately reassign all the volumes assigned to that MAST Gateway
   to other gateways. CLDB waits for some time to allow the MAST Gateway
   to come back up and send heartbeat again; it re-assigns volumes with
   pending tasks to other gateways if the MAST Gateway does not come back
   up again. All other volumes are redistributed when the gateway balancer
   runs again. On the other hand, if the MAST Gateway comes back up again,
   the volumes remain assigned to the MAST Gateway. The load on the MAST
   Gateways is rebalanced when the balancer runs again. See [4]Balancing
   Gateway Load for more information.

   If a MAST Gateway goes down during a file-level offload and if the
   offload was triggered using:
     * The [5]hadoop command, CLDB reassigns the volume to another MAST
       Gateway.
     * The [6]MapR CLI, [7]REST API, or [8]dot interface, CLDB does not
       reassign to another MAST Gateway.
