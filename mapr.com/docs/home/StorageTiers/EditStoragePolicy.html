Modifying a Storage Policy

   You can modify a rule using the MapR Control System, CLI, and REST API.
   If you modify a rule that is currently in use, the changes in the rule
   are only applied on future offloads; data offloaded using existing rule
   is not impacted by the change in the rule.

Modifying a Rule Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to Storage Policies tab in the Data > Volumes
       page.
       The list of storage policies displays.
    2. Click the storage policy name to display the Edit Storage Policy
       window.
    3. Make changes to the rule:
       You can modify the basic rule to:
          + Add ( [addAnother.png] ) or remove ( [deleteRow.png] ) users
            and/or groups.
          + Change the name of the users and/or groups.
          + Change the number of days since the file was last modified for
            users and/or groups.
       If you switch from a basic rule to an advanced rule, all
       expressions from the basic rule are carried over to the advanced
       rule. You can modify an advanced rule using a combination of the
       following expressions:

   u Username or user ID, as configured in the OS registry (such as
   /etc/passwd file, LDAP, etc.), of a specific user.

   Usage: u:<username or user ID>
   g Group name or group ID, as configured in the OS registry (such as
   /etc/group file, LDAP, etc.), of a specific group.

   Usage: u:<groupname or group ID>
   m (mtime) Time (in seconds or days) since the files were last modified.
   The number of seconds can be specified by appending s to value and the
   number of days can be specified by appending d to the value.

   Usage:
          + "m:<value>s" — specifies mtime in seconds
          + "m:<value>d" — specifies mtime in days

   All files whose modification timestamp (mtime) exceeds the specified
   amount of time are offloaded.

   Note: If the system time on CLDB and file server nodes are different,
   the mtime rule for offloading data may not work as intended.
   s The size of the file in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.
   The size of the file can be specified by appending one of the following
   to the value: b for bytes, k for kilobytes, m for megabytes, or g for
   gigabytes.

   Usage
          + "s:<value>b" — specifies filesize in bytes
          + "s:<value>k" — specifies filesize in KB
          + "s:<value>m" — specifies filesize in MB
          + "s:<value>g" — specifies filesize in GB

   All files whose size exceeds the specified size are offloaded.
       Or, use the following:

   p (Default) Specifies all files. Specifies that this operation is
   applicable to all the files without restriction. This cannot be
   combined with any other operator.
   "" Indicates none of the files. Specifies that this operation cannot be
   performed on any of the files.
       Use the following to string multiple criteria for offload:

   & AND operation to combine multiple expressions as the criteria for the
   rule.
   | OR operation to indicate either of the expressions as the criteria
   for the rule.
   () Delimiters for subexpressions.
       You cannot switch from an advanced rule that includes the following
       to a basic rule because the following are not supported in a basic
       rule:
          + p — All the files
          + s — The size of the file
          + & — The AND operation used for specifying multiple users (u),
            groups (g), or criteria
          + | — The OR operation used with s or m
          + "" — None of the files.
          + () — Subexpressions
       Note: The basic rule must contain mtime (m). It can also include
       one or more users or groups separated by the OR operation (|).
    4. Click Save Changes to save the storage policy changes.

Modifying a Rule Using the CLI and the REST API

     * [1]CLI
     * [2]REST API

   Run the following command to modify a storage policy:
$ maprcli tier rule modify -name <rule_name> -json

   Send a request of type POST. For example:
# curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/tier/rule/modify?name=sampleRule&
expr=m:3d' --user mapr:mapr
{"timestamp":1523587392465,"timeofday":"2018-04-12 07:43:12.465 GMT-0700 PM","st
atus":"OK","total":0,"data":[],"messages":["Successfully updated rule: 'sampleRu
le'"]}

   For more information, see [3]tier rule modify.
