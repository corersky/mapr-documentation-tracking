Removing a Tier

   You can remove a tier that is not associated with a volume using the
   MapR Control System, the CLI, and REST API. In the MCS, a cold tier is
   referred to as remote target and you can only remove remote targets (or
   cold tiers) using MCS. Use the CLI or REST API to remove cold and warm
   tiers.

Removing a Remote Target Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and click Data > Volumes > Remote Targets to display
       the list of remote targets.
    2. Select the checkbox associated with the tier to delete.
       Selecting the checkbox associated with a tier makes the Remove
       Target button available.
    3. Click Remote Target to display the Remove Remote Target
       confirmation dialog.
    4. Verify the list of remote targets to remove and click Remove.

Removing a Tier Using the CLI and REST API

     * [1]CLI
     * [2]REST API

   Run the following command to remove a tier:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli tier remove -name <tier-name>

   You cannot remove a tier associated with a volume. If you run the
   command to remove a tier that is associated with a volume, the command
   returns an error (shown in bold) similar to the following:
{
   "timestamp":1516771078126,
   "timeofday":"2018-01-23 09:17:58.126 GMT-0800",
   "status":"ERROR",
   "errors":[{
       "id":10003,
        "desc":"Cannot remove tier, as some volumes are still using it."
   }]
}

   Send a request of type POST to remove a tier. For example:
curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/tier/remove?name=ksTestTier' --user
 mapr:mapr

   You cannot remove a tier associated with a volume. If you send a
   request to remove a tier that is associated with a volume, an error
