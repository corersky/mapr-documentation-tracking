Balancing Gateway Load

   CLDB assigns volumes to MAST Gateways so that any tiering-related
   operation for a volume is performed by the MAST Gateway assigned to the
   volume. This assignment is sticky and the volume remains assigned to
   the same gateway across CLDB, MAST Gateway, and cluster restarts. When
   a MAST Gateway goes down, volumes assigned to the MAST Gateway are not
   re-assigned immediately. Instead, when a tiering operation needs to be
   run and the assigned MAST Gateway is down, CLDB assigns a new MAST
   Gateway to the volume, and the operation is performed using the newly
   assigned MAST Gateway.

   Volumes are assigned to gateways with the lowest load (or lowest number
   of volumes currently assigned to it) to ensure equal distribution.
   Whenever a volume is created or removed or whenever a MAST Gateway is
   added or removed, the load on the gateways require rebalancing. MapR
   automatically balances the load on the gateways after a certain
   (configurable) amount of time since the occurrence of the event that
   necessitates a rebalance. The delay after which MapR tries to rebalance
   varies based on the type of event that necessitates a rebalance. See
   [1]Configuring the Delay After Which Load Balancer runs for Events for
   more information.

   Each volume in the cluster is assigned a weight, which is 1 for all
   volumes. The load on a gateway is the sum of weights of all the volumes
   that are assigned to the gateway. Load balancer tries to ensure that
   the load on a gateway is at least the average weight.
avg weight = (sum(weight of all tiered vols) + num active gws - 1) / num active
gws

   When the balancer needs to pick volumes from a gateway for
   reassignment, it first picks the volume with max weight and one that
   currently has no activity (volume level offload, recall, or
   compaction). To minimize the interruptions in gateway activity, the
   balancer first considers idle volumes and picks volumes with active
   tasks after. However, any balancing and/or reassignment is skipped if
   there is already assignment related flux in the cluster (such as
   volumes with gateway assignment currently in progress). If this
   happens, load balancer runs again with a shorter time delay of 10
   minutes.

   MapR performs load balancing in batches of 5 volumes per run. That is,
   it assigns 5 volumes to gateways and then after a delay of 10 minutes
   by default, runs the load balancer again to distribute other volumes
   (in batches of 5). MapR figures out the next batch of volumes by
   re-evaluating the current assignment state. When the load on the
   gateway is balanced, the balancer is disabled and the load balancer is
   run again only by any of the 4 events.

Configuring Interval Between Load Balancer Runs

   MapR assigns 5 volumes to gateways and then after a delay of 10 minutes
   by default, runs the load balancer again to distribute other volumes
   (in batches of 5). Run the following command to configure the interval
   between runs:
maprcli config save -values {"cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.recheck":"<mins-in-seco
nds>"}

Configuring the Delay After Which Load Balancer runs for Events

   MapR runs the load balancer automatically for any of the following
   events. You can configure the delay after which MapR runs the load
   balancer.

   Create Volume
          When you create a tiering-enabled volume, it is assigned the
          gateway with the lowest load. If gateways are not available for
          the volume at the time of creation, the volume might stay
          unassigned. To ensure that the volume has an associated gateway
          for handling the tiering operations, MapR runs the gateway load
          balancer after a delay of 2 hours (7200 seconds) by default for
          this event.

          To configure the delay, set the value for
          cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.vol.create property (in seconds)
          using the [2]config save command. For example:

maprcli config save -values {"cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.vol.create":"<mins-in-s
econds>"}

   Remove Volume
          When you remove a volume, the distribution of volumes across
          gateways can become uneven, and the balancer must be run to
          redistribute the volumes. For this event, MapR runs the load
          balancer to redistribute the volumes and rebalance the gateways
          after a delay of 2 hours (7200 seconds) by default for this
          event.

          To configure the delay, set the value for the
          cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.vol.delete property (in seconds)
          using the [3]config save command. For example:

maprcli config save -values {"cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.vol.delete":"<mins-in-s
econds>"}

   Add Gateway
          When you install a new gateway on a cluster, volumes are
          assigned to the new gateway only if a new volume is created or
          an existing volume has a pending task, but no active assigned
          gateway. Volumes that have active gateways are not re-assigned
          by default. For this event, MapR runs the load balancer to
          re-distribute the volumes and rebalance the gateway load after a
          delay of 2 hours (7200 seconds) by default.

          To configure the delay, set the value for the
          cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.new.gw property (in seconds) using
          the [4]config save command. For example:

maprcli config save -values {"cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.new.gw":"<mins-in-secon
ds>"}

   Remove Gateway
          When you remove a gateway or when a gateway goes down, all the
          volumes assigned to the gateway are not re-assigned by default;
          only volumes with pending tasks are assigned to new gateways.
          For this event, MapR runs the load balancer to re-distribute the
          volumes after 6 hours (21600 seconds) by default.

          To configure the delay, set the value for the
          cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.dead.gw property (in seconds) using
          the [5]config save command. For example:

maprcli config save -values {"cldb.tier.gw.balance.delay.dead.gw":"<mins-in-seco
nds>"}

Determining the Volumes Assigned to MAST Gateways

   Run one of the following commands to determine the volumes that are
   assigned to MAST Gateways:
     *
/opt/mapr/server/mrconfig info mastgateway
     *
/opt/mapr/server/mrconfig info volume mastgateway

   For more information, see [6]mrconfig info.
