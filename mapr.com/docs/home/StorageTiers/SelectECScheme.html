Erasure Coding Scheme for Data Protection and Recovery

   Describes the erasure coding (EC) schemes for data protection and
   recovery.

   Erasure coding (EC) is a data protection method in which data is broken
   into fragments, expanded and encoded with redundant data pieces, and
   stored across a set of different locations or storage media.

   EC ensures that if data becomes corrupted, it can be reconstructed
   using information about the data that is present elsewhere.

   The time required to reconstruct data depends on the number of data
   fragments in the chosen EC scheme, and the number of failures that have
   occurred. For example, reconstruction of EC scheme 10+2 takes longer
   compared to the reconstruction of EC scheme 3+2, as a larger number of
   data blocks must be read.

Considerations When Selecting an EC scheme

   As an administrator, consider the following points when selecting an EC
   scheme:
     * How many nodes can you afford to have?
     * How long are you willing to wait for a node to be rebuilt?
     * How many failures might occur? Do you anticipate a single failure,
       or multiple failures?

EC Schemes

   In an erasure coded volume, an erasure coding scheme has the stripe
   layout m+n. The stripe is an array of m data fragments and n parity
   fragments with a fragment size of 4 MB.

   Each stripe is created by the same number of data fragments from all
   containers in the group of EC containers. Each container is placed on a
   different physical node.
     * m is the number of data fragments.
     * n is the number of redundant fragments (referred to as parity
       fragments).
     * The parity is calculated using data from all data fragments.
     * m/(m+n) is the encoding rate.
     * m+n is the number of encoded fragments.
     * You need to read a minimum of m blocks to recover data.
     * You can recover data from a maximum of n failures.

   For example, assume m=4, n=2, and stripe depth=4 MB.

     * The number of data fragments is four (4), and while the number of
       parity fragments is two (2).
     * The number of encoded fragments is six (6).
     * The stripe size is 16 MB (4x4 MB) of user data, and 8 MB (2x4 MB)
       of parity fragments.
     * The system can handle two (2) failures, and any chunk can be
       recovered from four (4) other chunks.

   Requirements for using an erasure coding scheme
     * The number of data fragments must be 3 to 10.
     * The number of parity fragments must be greater than 1 and less than
       the number of data fragments.
     * The number of data fragments must be greater than the number of
       parity fragments.
     * The number of nodes must be greater than or equal to the sum of
       data and parity fragments.

   Select from the following schemes for erasure-coded volumes:

   CAPTION:

   EC Scheme Number of Data Nodes Number of Parity Nodes Total Number of
   Nodes Needed Number of Failures Recoverable Number of Nodes to Read to
   Recover Data
   CLI MCS
   3+2 3, 2 3 2 5 2 3
   4+2 4, 2 4 2 6 2 4
   5+2 5, 2 5 2 7 2 5
   6+3 6, 3 6 3 9 3 6
   10+<x> where x is a value from 1 to 9 N.A 10 x 10+x x 10

   Although you can create a volume without the required number of nodes
   for a specific scheme, volume offload fails if the required number of
   nodes are not present.
   When choosing the scheme, note that more nodes leads to longer recovery
   time, resulting in degraded performance, network expense, and lengthy
   time to rebuild.
