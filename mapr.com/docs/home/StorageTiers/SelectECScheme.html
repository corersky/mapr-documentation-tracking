Selecting an Erasure Coding Scheme

   Erasure coding (EC) is a data protection method in which data is broken
   into fragments, then expanded and encoded with redundant data pieces,
   and stored across a set of different locations or storage media. An
   erasure coding scheme is the stripe layout m+n. Each stripe in an
   erasure coded volume is created by the same number of data fragments
   from all containers in the group of EC containers.

   Containers for erasure coded volumes are created in groups of m+n and
   each container is placed on a different physical node. The stripe is an
   array of m data fragments and n parity fragments with a fragment size
   of 4MB. In the event of disk failure, any m piece can be used to get
   back the original file. That is:
     * m is the number of data fragments
     * n is the number of redundant fragments (referred to as parity
       fragments)
     * m/(m+n) is the encoding rate
     * m+n is the number of encoded fragments

   For example, suppose m=4 and n=2, stripe depth=4MB. Here:
     * The number of data fragments is 4 and the number of parity
       fragments is 2.
     * The number of encoded fragments is 6.
     * The stripe size is 16MB (4x4MB) of user data and 8MB (2x4MB) of
       parity fragments.
     * MapR can handle 2 failures and any chunk can be recovered from any
       4 chunks.

   The following illustration shows the distribution of data and parity
   fragments for the above example:

   When specifying an erasure coding scheme without local parity, keep the
   following in mind:
     * The number of data fragments must be greater than or equal to 3 and
       less than or equal to 10.
     * The number of parity fragments must be greater than 1 and less than
       (not equal to) the number of data fragments.
     * The number of data fragments must be greater than (not equal to)
       the number of parity fragments.
     * The number of nodes must be greater than or equal to the sum of
       data and parity fragments.

   Choose from the following schemes for erasure-coded volumes:
   EC Scheme Description
   CLI MCS
   3+<x> 3, 2 Specifies 3 data fragments, and parity fragments less than
   the number of data fragments. Ensure that the required number of nodes,
   which is calculated by adding the number of data fragments and parity
   fragments, are available on the cluster.

   For example, MCS allows a setting of 3 data fragments and 2 parity
   fragments. For this scheme, a minimum of 5 nodes (3+2) is required.
   MapR can tolerate up to 2 failures.
   4+2 4, 2 (Default) Specifies 4 data fragments and 2 parity fragments. A
   minimum of 6 nodes is required for this option. MapR can tolerate up to
   2 failures.
   5+2 5, 2 Specifies 5 data fragments and 2 parity fragments. A minimum
   of 7 nodes is required for this option. MapR can tolerate up to 2
   failures.
   6+3 6, 3 Specifies 6 data fragments and 3 parity fragments. A minimum
   of 9 nodes is required for this option. MapR can tolerate up to 3
   failures.
   10+<x> N/A Specifies 10 data fragments, and parity fragments less than
   the number of data fragments. Ensure that the required number of nodes,
   which is calculated by adding the number of data fragments and parity
   fragments, are available on the cluster.

   For example, assume a scheme of 10 data fragments and 2 parity
   fragments. A minimum of 12 nodes (10+2) is required for this scheme.
   MapR can tolerate up to 2 failures.
   Note: In the event of a node failover, the amount of time to rebuild
   the objects (stripes) on another node depends on the number of data
   fragments in the chosen erasure coding scheme. For example, rebuild of
   erasure-coding scheme 10+2 could take more time compared to the
   erasure-coding scheme 3+2.
   Note: Although you can create a volume even without the required number
   of nodes for a specific scheme, volume offload will fail if the
   required number of nodes are not present.
