Data Compaction

   When you release the space allocated to a volume on the MapR cluster by
   deleting a file or snapshot, or by truncating a file, MapR's tier
   compactor can be set up to run automatically or manually to release the
   space on the tier associated with the volume by deleting the
   corresponding stripes or objects from the tier. In addition, when you
   recall data, the compactor automatically purges the recalled data on
   the MapR cluster if there are no changes to the data. By default, the
   compactor runs on an automatic internal schedule to determine if any
   deletion has happened on the MapR cluster since it last ran and if
   necessary, remove the corresponding stripelets or objects from the
   tier.
   MapR uses two settings (at the volume level) to determine when and how
   frequently to run the compactor:
     * Overhead threshold — You can specify a percentage of offloaded data
       that must have been deleted to trigger the compaction operation. By
       default, the compactor performs the compaction operation only if at
       least 30% of the offloaded data is deleted.
     * Compactor schedule — You can set up a custom schedule to run the
       compactor. By default, MapR uses the Internal Automatic Scheduler
       (ID is 4), which is based on internal parameters, to run the
       compactor.

   The compactor runs only when there are no other tiering operations
   running for the volume. If there are other tiering operations, such as
   offload or recall, running for the volume, the compactor does not run
   until the tiering operation completes. If a tiering operation is
   triggered while the compactor is running, the tiering operation will
   fail. You cannot trigger a volume-level tiering job when another job is
   running for the volume. You can trigger a file-level offload or recall
   operation when a volume level job is running and vice versa.

Purging Recalled Data

   When you recall data to the MapR cluster explicitly (by running the
   recall command) or implicitly (by doing a read or an overwrite), the
   recalled data is purged by the compactor if there are no changes to the
   data and if the expiration time for recalled data has been reached or
   has passed. You can also manually run the compactor to force an
   immediate purge of recalled data. See [1]Running the Compactor to Purge
   Recalled Data on the MapR Cluster for more information.

Purging Stale Data

   When you release space on the MapR cluster by deleting or modifying
   data, the compactor purges the data on the tier also. Depending on
   whether file data is completely deleted or partially deleted on the
   MapR cluster, the MapR compactor processes purging of data on the tier.
     * [2]Warm Tier
     * [3]Cold Tier

   For warm tiered volumes, the MapR compactor identifies corresponding
   objects (or stripes) on the tier and deletes entire objects first.
   After deleting entire objects, if there are partial objects to delete,
   the MapR compactor identifies the objects (with partially deleted data)
   that can be coalesced, fetches them, creates new objects with combined
   data, updates the metadata in the DB tables, deletes the old objects
   from the tier, and offloads the new objects to the tier. The compactor
   handles partial deletions only after deleting entire objects and only
   if the size of the remaining data to delete exceeds the compaction
   threshold.

   For cold tiered volumes in the S3 environment, while entire objects can
   be easily deleted, modifications and partial deletions are not
   supported. For example, suppose data associated with a file is
   distributed across objects. When a file is deleted on the MapR cluster,
   corresponding data on the S3 tier can be easily removed if the object
   in the S3 only contains data associated with the deleted file. On the
   other hand, if the object contains data from other files also, the
   object cannot be deleted and S3 does not support changes to the object
   or partial deletion of the object.

   For partial deletions, the MapR compactor identifies the objects (with
   partially deleted data) that can be coalesced, fetches them, creates
   new objects with combined data, updates the metadata in the DB tables,
   deletes the old objects from the tier, and offloads the new objects to
   the S3 tier. The compactor handles partial deletions only after
   deleting entire objects and only if the size of the remaining data to
   delete exceeds the compaction threshold.

   You can manually trigger the compactor to purge the stale data on the
   tier. See [4]Running the Compactor to Purge Stale Data on the Tier for
   more information.
