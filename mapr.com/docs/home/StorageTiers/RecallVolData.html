Recalling a Volume to MapR Filesystem

   When you:
     * Read data offloaded to a remote target (or cold tier), data is
       automatically recalled to MapR Filesystem to allow the read to
       succeed.
     * Modify data offloaded to an erasure coded volume (or warm tier) or
       a remote target (or cold tier), data is automatically recalled to
       MapR Filesystem to allow the write to succeed.

   The recalled data is automatically:
     * Purged based on the expiration time period set at the volume level
       for recalled data if there are no changes (for example, read
       operation).
     * Offloaded automatically based on the rule and the expiration time
       period set at the volume level for recalled data if there are
       changes (for example, overwrite operation).

   See [1]Data Reads, Writes, and Recalls for more information. If the
   recall fails, CLDB retries the operation after some time. See
   [2]Retrying Failed Operation for more information.

   You can manually recall all data in a volume using the MapR Control
   System, CLI, and REST API.
   Note: For a tiered volume, there can be only one running job at any
   given time. For example, suppose another job is running on the tiered
   volume, if you trigger a recall operation, the recall operation will
   fail.

   You can also recall individual files from the tier. See [3]Recalling a
   File to MapR Filesystem Using the CLI and REST API for more
   information.

Recalling Offloaded Volume Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and click Data > Volumes.
    2. Select the tiered volumes to recall from the list of volumes in the
       Volumes pane.
       Selecting a volume makes the Actions drop-down menu available.
    3. Click Recall Data from the Actions drop-down menu to display the
       Recall Tiered Data confirmation window.
    4. Review the list of volumes to recall and click Recall Volumes.
       For more information, see [4]Recall of Tiered Data.

Recalling Offloaded Volume Using the CLI and REST API

     * [5]CLI
     * [6]REST API

   Run the following command to recall volume data:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprcli volume recall -name <volName>

   Send a request of type POST to URL. For example:
curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/volume/recall?name=volName' --user
mapr:mapr

   For more information, see [7]volume recall.
