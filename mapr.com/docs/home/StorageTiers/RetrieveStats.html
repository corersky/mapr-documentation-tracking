Retrieving Stats Using guts

   You can run the /opt/mapr/bin/guts utility to get granular information
   on ongoing offloads and recalls including:
     * The number of objects that are offloaded to and recalled from the
       tier
     * The number of reads and writes on MapR Database
     * The number of reads and writes on MapR Filesystem

Syntax

/opt/mapr/bin/guts <argument>:<options>

Arguments

   CAPTION:

   Argument Description
   mastgateway Refers to operations on MAST Gateway node. See [1]Usage for
   information on the syntax for running the guts command with this
   argument.
   fstier Refers to operations on MapR Filesystem node. See [2]Usage for
   information on the syntax for running the guts command with this
   argument.

Options

   CAPTION:

   Option Description
   all Stats for all operations.
   db Stats for MAST Gateway operations currently running on MapR
   Database.
   mfsops Stats for MAST Gateway operations on MapR Filesystem.
   none Specifies the column(s) to exclude from the output.
   tier Stats for MAST Gateway operations on the storage tier.

Usage

   MAST Gateway Node

/opt/mapr/bin/guts mastgateway:all
/opt/mapr/bin/guts mastgateway:db
/opt/mapr/bin/guts mastgateway:tier
/opt/mapr/bin/guts mastgateway:mfsops
/opt/mapr/bin/guts mastgateway:none

   MapR Filesystem Node

/opt/mapr/bin/guts fstier:all
/opt/mapr/bin/guts fstier:none

   Note: These commands might show stats for several other fields. To
   skip, use none with the components whose fields you do not wish to
   retrieve. For example, to retrieve stats for only mastgateway tier, run
   the following command:
/opt/mapr/bin/guts allocator:none btree:none cache:none cleaner:none client:none
 cpu:none db:none dbrepl:none disk:none fs:none fstier:none gateway:none io:none
 kv:none log:none mastgateway:tier net:none nfs:none rpc:none ssd:none streams:n
one time:none vcd:none

Output

   mastgateway:tier

   CAPTION:

   objP Number of objects (whose max size is 8MB for cold-tier or whose
   size is computed based on the erasure coding scheme for warm-tier) that
   were offloaded to the storage tier.
   objG Number of objects (whose size is up to 1 MB for cold-tier and
   whose size is computed based on the erasure coding scheme for
   warm-tier) that were recalled from the storage tier.
   objD Number of deletions on the tier.
   objPM Amount of data (in MB) offloaded per second to the storage tier.
   objGM Amount of data (in MB) recalled per second from the storage tier.

   mastgateway:db

   CAPTION:

          tdbP Number of puts on MapR Database tables.
          tdbG Number of gets on MapR Database tables.
          tdbD Number of deletes on MapR Database tables.

   mastgateway:mfsops

   CAPTION:

   moR Number of read requests from client to the MAST Gateway service to
   read from cache volumes.
   mp Number of MapR Filesystem purge requests sent by the MAST Gateway
   service.
   mrw Number of MapR Filesystem reads from the MAST Gateway service to
   perform modify/write operation.
   moRM Amount of MapR Filesystem reads (in MB) sent by the MAST Gateway
   service to read offloaded data.
   mrwM Amount of recall writes (in MB) sent by the MAST Gateway service.

   fstier:all

   CAPTION:

         tp  Number of blocks (of 64KB) purged during an offload operation.
         trw Number of blocks (of 64KB) written during recall of offloaded data.
         trr Number of blocks (of 64KB) read during read of offloaded data.
         twr Number of blocks (of 64KB) recalled for partial overwrites.
