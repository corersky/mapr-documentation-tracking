Retrieving the Status of a Volume-level Tiering Operation

   You can check the status of an active volume offload, completed
   offload, aborted offload, and recall operations using the MapR Control
   System, the CLI, and REST API. For information on file level tiering
   job, see [1]Retrieving Status of File-level Tiering Operation and File
   Data.

Retrieving Status of Volume-level Operation Using the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and click Data > Volumes.
   The Volumes pane in the page displays the following for tiered volumes:
     * Job — The currently running or last completed tiering job for the
       volume.
     * State — The status of the tiering job.
     * Progress — The completion percentage of the tiering job.

Retrieving Status of Volume-level Operation Using the CLI and REST API

     * [2]CLI
     * [3]REST

   Run the following command to check the status of an active or completed
   offload, abort, and/or recall operation:
maprcli volume tierjobstatus -name <volume_name> -json

   Note: You must have full control (fc) permissions either at the cluster
   or at the volume level to run this command. To determine the status of
   a compaction operation, specify the verbose option with the
   tierjobstatus command. For example:
maprcli volume tierjobstatus -name <volume_name> -verbose true -json

   Send a request of type GET.
curl -k -X GET 'https://<host>:8443/rest/volume/tierjobstatus?name=<volume_name>
' --user mapr:mapr

   See [4]Statuses for more information.
