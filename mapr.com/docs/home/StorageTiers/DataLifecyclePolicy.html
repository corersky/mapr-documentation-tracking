Data Storage Policy

   You can configure a storage policy (or rules) for data at the volume
   level. The storage policy simplifies the lifecycle management of data
   in the volume including automated migration of files to low-cost
   storage alternatives. The policy can contain rules for files that have
   a well-defined lifecycle or for files you want to switch to different
   storage tiers during their lifecycle.

   You can specify the rules, at the volume level, to selectively identify
   files to offload (such as file size, file owner, and file modification
   time), the schedule for offloading the data (for example, 2 months
   after file modification), and the settings for storing (such as the
   location and credentials for the tier) and recalling the offloaded
   data. You can configure one rule per volume using the CLI or REST API.
   You can also associate a schedule to automatically offload data at
   scheduled intervals based on the associated rules.

   See [1]Managing Storage Policies for more information.
