Aborting a Running Volume-Level Tiering Job

   You can abort an ongoing offload or recall of a volume using the MapR
   Control System and the CLI. Aborting a running:
     * Offload operation does not prevent future offloads; if a schedule
       is associated with the volume, data that is still on the cluster is
       automatically offloaded based on the rules as per schedule. You can
       also manually offload data again at any time by running the
       [1]volume offload command.
     * Recall operation does not prevent future recalls; you can run the
       recall command again to recall the remaining data on the tier.
       Based on the expiry time set on the volume (associated with the
       recalled data), recalled data is offloaded if there are changes or
       purged if there are no changes. See [2]Recalling a Volume to MapR
       Filesystem for more information.

   You can check the status of an abort operation using the [3]volume
   tierjobstatus command.
   Note: If you abort a job that CLDB was retrying after a prior failed
   attempt (FailureRetriable job), CLDB will stop trying to run the job
   again. For more information on FailureRetriable job, see [4]Retrying
   Failed Operation.

   For information of aborting a file-level job, see [5]Aborting a Running
   File-Level Tiering Job and [6]Running Tiering Commands when maprcli and
   hadoop Commands are not Available.

Aborting Volume Offload or Recall Operation Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and click Data > Volumes.
    2. Select the tiered volumes to offload from the list of volumes in
       the Volumes pane.
       Selecting a volume makes the Actions drop-down menu available.
    3. Click Abort Tiering Job from the Actions drop-down menu to display
       the Abort Tiering Job confirmation window.
    4. Review the list of volumes and click Abort Job.

Aborting Volume Offload or Recall Operation Using the CLI and REST API

     * [7]CLI
     * [8]REST API

   Run the following command to abort a running offload or recall
   operation:
maprcli volume tierjobabort -name <volName>

   For more information, see [9]volume tierjobabort.
   Send a request of type POST. For example:
curl -k -X POST 'https://<host>:8443/rest/volume/tierjobabort?name=<volName>' --
user mapr:mapr
