Managing Storage Policies

   Data offload is driven by rules, which are configured per volume. Data
   offload rule can be based on size of file (s), owner (u, g, or p) of
   the file, and/or file modification timestamp (m). You can apply one
   rule per volume.

   When a rule is associated with a volume, the rule is first applied on
   the files in the tiering-enabled volume. When applied on the files in
   the tiering-enabled volume, the offload is triggered for all files in
   the snapshot chain as well when the criteria in the rule is met. If the
   file does not exist in the tiering-enabled volume, rule is applied on
   the latest state of the file in the snapshot chain. If the file exists
   in the tiering-enabled volume but has no latest state or if the file
   was deleted in the tiering-enabled volume, offload does not happen.

   Rules can be defined using a combination of the following:
   u Username or user ID, as configured in the OS registry (such as
   /etc/passwd file, LDAP, etc.), of a specific user.

   Usage: u:<username or user ID>
   g Group name or group ID, as configured in the OS registry (such as
   /etc/group file, LDAP, etc.), of a specific group.

   Usage: u:<groupname or group ID>
   m (mtime) Time (in seconds or days) since the files were last modified.
   The number of seconds can be specified by appending s to value and the
   number of days can be specified by appending d to the value.

   Usage:
     * "m:<value>s" — specifies mtime in seconds
     * "m:<value>d" — specifies mtime in days

   All files whose modification timestamp (mtime) exceeds the specified
   amount of time are offloaded.
   Note: If the system time on CLDB and file server nodes are different,
   the mtime rule for offloading data may not work as intended.
   s The size of the file in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.
   The size of the file can be specified by appending one of the following
   to the value: b for bytes, k for kilobytes, m for megabytes, or g for
   gigabytes.

   Usage
     * "s:<value>b" — specifies filesize in bytes
     * "s:<value>k" — specifies filesize in KB
     * "s:<value>m" — specifies filesize in MB
     * "s:<value>g" — specifies filesize in GB

   All files whose size exceeds the specified size are offloaded.
   Or, use the following:
   p (Default) Specifies all files. Specifies that this operation is
   applicable to all the files without restriction. This cannot be
   combined with any other operator.
   "" Indicates none of the files. Specifies that this operation cannot be
   performed on any of the files.
   Use the following to string multiple criteria for offload:
   & AND operation to combine multiple expressions as the criteria for the
   rule.
   | OR operation to indicate either of the expressions as the criteria
   for the rule.
   () Delimiters for subexpressions.

   For volumes configured for erasure coding, a default storage policy,
   default.ectier.rule (ID 1 and expression p), is applied if one is not
   specified.

   You can create, associate, and remove rules using the MapR Control
   System, the CLI, and REST API.
