Managing Tiered Files from the Command-line

   After creating a tiered volume and associating a tier with the volume,
   you can manually trigger offload and recall of individual files in the
   volume using the CLI. This section describes how to offload file to and
   recall file from the tier, retrieve status of a file-level tiering
   operation, and how to perform certain tiering operations when hadoop
   and maprcli are not available on the host you wish to use for
   triggering the tiering operation.
