Enabling Tiering

   On all new installations, the data tiering functionality is enabled and
   available for all new volumes. If you are upgrading, you must enable
   data tiering; see [1]Step 4: Enable New Features for more information.
   If the data tiering functionality is enabled, you can then selectively
   enable tiering for a volume at the time of volume creation using the
   MapR Control system and the CLI. Data tiering is only available for new
   volumes; you cannot enable data tiering for existing volumes. Enable
   tiering for new volumes where read/write latency is not the dominant
   concern. You can decide later whether you want to do local (or warm) or
   remote (or cold) tiering. Data tiering cannot be disabled after it is
   enabled for a volume.

Enabling Tiering Using the MapR Control System

    1. Move the Data Tier slider to Yes (to enable tiering) in the Create
       New Volume page in MCS.
       Proceed to the next step only if you wish to select a tier type for
       the volume. You can create a tiering-enabled volume without
       selecting a tier type and select a tier type later by editing the
       volume.
       Note: You cannot disable tiering for a volume after it is enabled.
    2. (Optional) Select Erasure Coding (for warm tiering) or Remote
       Archiving (for cold tiering) from the Tiering Type drop-down menu.
       You:
          + Can enable a volume for either warm or cold tiering, but not
            for both.
          + Cannot modify the tier type after the volume is created.
    3. Specify all other required and optional properties for creating the
       volume and click Create Volume.
       For information on required and optional properties, see
       [2]Creating a Volume.

Enabling Tiering Using the CLI

   Run the following command to enable tiering:
maprcli volume create -name <vol-name> -path <mount-path> -tieringenable true

   For more information, see [3]volume create.
