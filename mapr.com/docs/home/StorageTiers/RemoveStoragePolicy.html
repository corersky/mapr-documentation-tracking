Removing a Storage Policy

   You can remove a storage policy that is currently not in use using the
   MapR Control System, CLI, and REST API. You cannot remove a storage
   policy that is associated with a volume.

Removing a Rule Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to Storage Policies tab under Data > Volumes.
       The list of storage policies displays.
    2. Select the checkbox associated with the storage policy to remove
       and click Remove Policy.
       The Remove Policy confirmation window displays.
    3. Review the list of policies to remove and click Remove.

Removing a Rule Using the CLI and the REST API

     * [1]CLI
     * [2]REST

   Run the following command to remove a storage policy that is not
   associated with a volume:
# maprcli tier rule remove -name <rule_name>

   If you try to remove a rule associated with a volume, the command
   returns an error (shown in bold) similar to the following:
# maprcli tier rule remove -name rule1 -json
{
   "timestamp":1516771655669,
   "timeofday":"2018-01-23 09:27:35.669 GMT-0800",
   "status":"ERROR",
   "errors":[{
      "id":10003,
      "desc":"Cannot remove rule, as some volumes are still using it."
   }]
}

   Send a request of type POST. For example:
# curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/tier/rule/remove?name=sampleRule'
 --user mapr:mapr
{"timestamp":1523571783113,"timeofday":"2018-04-12 03:23:03.113 GMT-0700 PM","st
atus":"OK","total":0,"data":[],"messages":["Successfully deleted rule: 'sampleRu
le'"]}

   If you try to remove a storage policy associated with a volume, the
   response contains an error (shown in bold) similar to the following:
# curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/tier/rule/remove?name=sampleRule'
 --user mapr:mapr
{"timestamp":1523571741636,"timeofday":"2018-04-12 03:22:21.636 GMT-0700 PM","st
atus":"ERROR","errors":[{"id":10003,"desc":"Can not remove rule, as some volumes
 are still using it."}]}
