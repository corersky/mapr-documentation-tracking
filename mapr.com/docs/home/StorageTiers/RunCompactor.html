Running the Compactor Using the CLI and REST API

   You can trigger the compactor using the CLI and REST API to purge
   recalled data on the MapR cluster or to purge stale data on the tier.
   See [1]Data Compaction for more information.

Running the Compactor to Purge Recalled Data on the MapR Cluster

     * [2]CLI
     * [3]REST

   Run the following command to trigger the compactor and purge data
   whether or not the expiry time for recalled data has been reached:
maprcli volume compact -name <volName> -forcerecallexpiry true

   Send a request of type POST. For example:
curl -k -X POST 'https://<host>:8443/rest/volume/compact?name=<volName>&forcerec
allexpiry=true' --user mapr:mapr

   For more information, see [4]volume compact.

Running the Compactor to Purge Stale Data on the Tier

     * [5]CLI
     * [6]REST

   Run the following command to trigger the compactor:
maprcli volume compact -name <volName>

   Send a request of type POST.
curl -k -X POST 'https://<host>:8443/rest/volume/compact?name=<volName>' --user
mapr:mapr

   When you trigger the compactor, the compactor purges stale data from
   the tier and also recalled data on the MapR cluster if the expiry time
   for recalled data has been reached. For more information, see [7]volume
   compact.
