Configuring Secure Access

   If the MapR cluster is a secure cluster and the MAST Gateway is
   installed on a cluster node, no additional configuration is needed for
   the MAST Gateway to access data. On the other hand, if the MapR cluster
   is a secure cluster and if MAST Gateway is installed on an edge node,
   to enable the MAST Gateway to communicate with the secure MapR cluster,
   do the following:
    1. Copy the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket,
       /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_keystore, and /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore
       files on the CLDB node to the /opt/mapr/conf directory on the edge
       node.
    2. Run configure.sh as shown below:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -C <cldb-node-IP-addresses> -Z <zookeeper-node-IP-
addresses> -secure -N <cluster-name>
       See [1]configure.sh for more information.
