Using OpenTSDB with AsyncHBase

   OpenTSDB can use MapRâ€™s AsyncHBase to perform time-series data-plots on
   MapR Database binary tables.

   The [1]OpenTSDB software package provides a time-series database that
   collects user-specified data.

   To use OpenTSDB with AsyncHBase, install and configure OpenTSBD from
   source files or from a package.
