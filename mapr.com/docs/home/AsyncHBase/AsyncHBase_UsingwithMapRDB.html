AsyncHBase Behavior with MapR Database Binary Tables

   After you install AsyncHBase, you can use the AsyncHBase libraries to
   provide asynchronous access to MapR Database binary tables. However, it
   is important to note the behavior that is specific to using AsyncHBase
   with MapR Database.

   The Scanner.setMaxNumKeyValues method, when run against MapR Database
          binary tables, does not behave as documented.
          According to the AsyncHBase documentation, this [1]method sets
          “the maximum number of KeyValues the server is allowed to return
          in a single RPC response.”

          When you use this method with MapR Database binary tables, the
          value for the maximum number of key values is ignored and the
          full set of KeyValues is always returned.

   List<RegionClientStats> regionStats() is not supported
          As of AsyncHBase 1.7-1603, List<RegionClientStats> regionStats()
          is not supported and when it is used the API does not return
          statistics.

   MapR Database ignores HBase configurations in the asynchbase.conf file
          As of AsyncHBase 1.7-1603, the [2]conf object can be used to
          override Hbase properties that were previously only configured
          in the asynchbase.conf file. The asynchbase.conf file is located
          in the asynchbase installation directory. MapR Database does not
          use these Hbase configurations and therefore they are ignored by
          MapR Database
