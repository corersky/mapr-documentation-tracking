AsyncHBase Behavior with MapR-DB Binary Tables

   After you install AsyncHBase, you can use the AsyncHBase libraries to
   provide asynchronous access to MapR-DB binary tables. However, it is
   important to note the behavior that is specific to using AsyncHBase
   with MapR-DB.

   The Scanner.setMaxNumKeyValues method, when run against MapR-DB binary
          tables, does not behave as documented.
          According to the AsyncHBase documentation, this [1]method sets
          “the maximum number of KeyValues the server is allowed to return
          in a single RPC response.”

          When you use this method with MapR-DB binary tables, the value
          for the maximum number of key values is ignored and the full set
          of KeyValues is always returned.

   List<RegionClientStats> regionStats() is not supported
          As of AsyncHBase 1.7-1603, List<RegionClientStats> regionStats()
          is not supported and when it is used the API does not return
          statistics.

   MapR-DB ignores HBase configurations in the asynchbase.conf file
          As of AsyncHBase 1.7-1603, the [2]conf object can be used to
          override Hbase properties that were previously only configured
          in the asynchbase.conf file. The asynchbase.conf file is located
          in the asynchbase installation directory. MapR-DB does not use
          these Hbase configurations and therefore they are ignored by
          MapR-DB
