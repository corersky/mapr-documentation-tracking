Managing Kafka Schema Registry

   You can use the kafkastore.stream configuration parameter to specify
   the stream for Kafka Schema Registry internal topic.

   The default value for the kafkastore.stream property is
   /apps/schema-registry/schema-registry-internal-stream.

   You can manage and configure Kafka Schema Registry as other ecosystem
   components using Warden and /opt/mapr/server/configure.sh.

   By default, for secure clusters, the internal stream is readable by all
   the users and writable only by cluster administrator. For non-secure
   clusters, the stream has both read and write permissions for all the
   users. The default permissions can be modified by means of the maprcli
   stream API.
