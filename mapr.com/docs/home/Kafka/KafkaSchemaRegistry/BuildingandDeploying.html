Building and Deploying Kafka Schema Registry

   To build and deploy Kafka Schema Registry with Maven, you must first
   install development versions of Kafka common and rest-utils utilities.

   You can run Kafka Schema Registry instances on several cluster nodes.
   One node is the master node and the other ones are slave nodes.

   Kafka Schema Registry requires ZooKeeper and MapR Event Store For
   Apache Kafka.

   The REST interface to schema registry includes a built-in Jetty server.
   The wrapper scripts bin/schema-registry-start and
   bin/schema-registry-stop are the recommended methods for starting and
   stopping the service.
   In Apache Kafka, a schema is produced when:
     * A message is produced and there is no equivalent schema in the
       schema registry
     * A schema is created for key or value portion of the message

   The associated schema subject is a “topic-key”:
     * Each schema is associated with a version
     * Every schema gets a globally unique ID

   The consumer gets the messages’ schema using the schema ID:
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8087/schemas/ids/1
        {"schema":"\"string\""}

   You can also query a schema for a given topic using the associated
   schema subject. For example, for topic1 (for either key or value),
   schema, all, latest, or specific schema versions can be queried using
   the following REST commands:
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8087/subjects/topic1-value/versions
     [1]
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8087/subjects/Kafka-value/versions/1
     {"subject":"Kafka-value","version":1,"id":1,"schema":"\"string\""}
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8087/subjects/Kafka-value/versions/latest
     {"subject":"Kafka-value","version":1,"id":1,"schema":"\"string\""}

   API Reference.
