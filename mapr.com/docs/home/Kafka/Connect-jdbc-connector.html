JDBC Connector

   The topics describes the JDBC connector, drivers, and configuration
   parameters.

   The JDBC connector allows you to import data from any relational
   database into MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka and export data from
   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka to any relational database with a
   JDBC driver. By using JDBC, this connector can support a wide variety
   of databases without requiring custom code for each one.

   The JDBC connector provides flexibility regarding which databases you
   can import data from and how that data is imported. JDBC connector
   implements the data copying functionality on the generic JDBC APIs, and
   relies on JDBC drivers to handle the database-specific implementation
   of those APIs.
   The supported relational databases include:
     * MySQL
     * Oracle
     * PostgreSQL
     * SQLite
     * SQL Server
     * Hive is supported for the JDBC Source Connector
