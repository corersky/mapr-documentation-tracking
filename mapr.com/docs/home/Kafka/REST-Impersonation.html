User Impersonation

   Describes how to disable, enable, and use impersonation with Kafka
   REST.

   User impersonation enables Kafka REST jobs to be submitted as a
   particular user. Without impersonation, Kafka REST submits jobs as the
   user that started Kafka REST server.

   On a MapR cluster, the impersonated user is typically the mapr user or
   the user specified in the MAPR_USER environment variable. By default,
   impersonation and PAM authentication in Kafka REST are enabled on all
   types of security.

Disabling User Impersonation

   To disable user impersonation, you need to first disable the PAM
   authentication properties in the kafka-rest.properties file and then
   disable the rest.proxy.enable.doAs property.
    1. Disable PAM authentication. Set the following properties in
       opt/mapr/kafka-rest/kafka-rest-<version>/config/kafka-rest.properti
       es:
          + authentication.method=NONE
          + authentication.realm=""
    2. Once authentication is disabled, set the following property in
       /opt/mapr/kafka-rest/kafka-rest-<version>/config/kafka-rest.propert
       ies:
          + rest.proxy.enable.doAs=false

Example: Verify that a list of topics is owned by an impersonated user

   This example gets a list of topics from a particular stream and then
   checks that it is owned by a particular user. Depending on whether or
   not impersonation is enabled (the default), you may need to use a
   different curl command.
$  sudo maprcli stream info -json  -path /stream1
{
 "timestamp":1505471089855,
  "timeofday":"2017-09-15 10:24:49.855 GMT+0000",
  "status":"OK",
  "total":1,
  "data":[
       {
       "path":"/stream1",
       "physicalsize":245760,
       "logicalsize":114688,
       "numtopics":2,
       "defaultpartitions":1,
       "ttl":604800,
       "compression":"lz4",
       "autocreate":true,
       "produceperm":"u:root",
       "consumeperm":"u:root",
       "topicperm":"u:root",
       "copyperm":"u:root",
       "adminperm":"u:root",
       "ischangelog":false
       }
    ]
 }

   If impersonation is enabled (the default), use the following query,
   where the query is submitted as the root user.
$ curl -u root  -X GET http://localhost:8082/topics/%2Fstream%3Atopic1
Enter host password for user 'root':
{"name":"/stream:topic1","configs":null,"partitions":
  [{"partition":0,"leader":0,"replicas":[{"broker":0,"leader":true,"in_sync":tru
e},
   {"broker":0,"leader":false,"in_sync":true}]}]}

   If impersonation is disabled, use the following query, where the query
   is submitted as the mapr user.
$ curl  -X GET http://localhost:8082/topics/%2Fstream%3Atopic1
{"error_code":40401,"message":"Topic not found."}
