Configuration Parameters

   This section provides the Kafka REST Proxy for MapR-ES parameters.
   These parameters are configurable in the kafka-rest.properties file.

   CAPTION: Table 1. Configuration Parameters for Kafka REST Proxy

   Parameter Description
   streams.default.stream Defines the default stream for both the consumer
   and producer. This allows you to use topics without having the stream
   path included in the topic name.
   id

   Unique ID for this REST server instance. This is used in generating
   unique IDs for consumers that do not specify their ID. The ID is empty
   by default, which makes a single server setup easier to get up and
   running, but is not safe for multi-server deployments where automatic
   consumer IDs are used. Type: string. Default: empty

   consumer.threads The number of threads to run consumer requests on.
   Type: int. Default: 1
   simpleconsumer.cache.max.records

   Maximum number of records that can be stored in a single cache. Records
   with higher offsets replace records with lower ones. The value must be
   greater than 0. Type: int. Default: 1000.

   simpleconsumer.max.caches.num

   Maximum number topic-partition combinations for which records are
   cached. If this parameter is set to 0, then caching is disabled and
   extra records are thrown away. Cache improves performance if records
   are fetched sequentially thus increasing offsets.

   A pool of caches are available to store extra fetch records by a
   KafkaConsumer for a particular TopicPartition. The cache increases
   performance when records are fetched from a particular topic partition
   in a sequential manner. For example, every next request will start with
   the following offset after the offset of the latest fetched record in
   the previous request. Type: int. Default: 0
   simpleconsumer.max.poll.time

   Specifies the maximum number of milliseconds that are spent for polling
   records by a simpleconsumer. The greater the value means greater
   latency but higher throughput. Type: int. Default: 1000

   simpleconsumer.pool.size.max

   Maximum number of SimpleConsumers that can be instantiated. If 0, then
   the pool size is not limited. Type: int. Default: 25

   simpleconsumer.pool.timout.ms

   Amount of time to wait for an available SimpleConsumer from the pool
   before failing. Use 0 for no timeout. Type: int. Default: 1000

   consumer.instance.timeout.ms Amount of idle time (in milliseconds)
   before a consumer instance is automatically destroyed. Type: int.
   Default: 300000 (5 minutes)
   consumer.iterator.backoff.ms

   Amount of time (in milliseconds) to backoff when an iterator runs out
   of data. If a consumer has a dedicated worker thread, this is
   effectively the maximum error for the entire request timeout. This
   parameter should be small enough to closely target the timeout, but
   large enough to avoid busy waiting. Type: int. Default: 50

   consumer.request.max.byte

   Maximum number of bytes in unencoded message keys and values returned
   by a single request. This can be used by administrators to limit the
   memory used by a single consumer and to control the memory usage
   required to decode responses on clients that cannot perform a streaming
   decode. Note that the actual payload will be larger due to overhead
   from base64 encoding the response data and from JSON encoding the
   entire response. Type: long. Default: 6710884

   consumer.request.timeout.ms

   The maximum total time (in milliseconds) to wait for messages for a
   request if the maximum number of messages has not yet been reached.
   Type: int. Default: 1

   producer.threads

   Number of threads to run producer requests on. Type: int. Default: 5

   request.logger.name

   Name of the SLF4J logger to write the NCSA Common Log Format request
   log. Type: string. Default: io.confluent.rest-utils.requests.

   response.mediatype.default

   The default response media type that should be used if no specify types
   are requested in an Accept header. Type: string. Default:
   application/vnd.kafka.v1+json

   response.mediatype.preferred

   An ordered list of the server's preferred media types used for
   responses, from most preferred to least. Type: list. Default:
   application/vnd.kafka.v1+json, application/vnd.kafka+json,
   application/json

   access.control.allow.methods

   Sets the value to the Jetty Access-Control-Allow-Origin header for
   specified methods. Type: string. Default: empty

   access.control.allow.origin

   Sets the value for the Jetty Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. Type:
   string. Default: empty

   host.name

   The host name used to generate absolute URLs in responses. If empty,
   the default canonical hostname is used. Type: string. Default: empty

   debug

   Boolean indicating whether extra debugging information is generated in
   some error response entities. Type: Boolean. Default: false

   shutdown.graceful.ms

   Amount of time to wait after a shutdown request for outstanding
   requests to complete. Type: int. Default: 1000

   metric.reporters

   A list of classes to use as metrics reporters. Implementing the
   MetricReporterinterface allows plugging in classes that will be
   notified of new metric creation. The JmxReporter is always included to
   register JMX statistics. Type: list. Default: empty

   metrics.jmx.prefix

   Prefix to apply to metric names for the default JMX reporter. Type:
   string. Default: kafka.rest

   metrics.num.samples

   The number of samples maintained to compute metrics. Type: int.
   Default: 2

   metrics.sample.window.ms

   The metrics system maintains a configurable number of samples over a
   fixed window size. This configuration controls the size of the window.
   For example, used to maintain two samples each measured over a 30
   second period. When a window expires, the oldest window is erased and
   overwritten. Type: long. Default: 30000
