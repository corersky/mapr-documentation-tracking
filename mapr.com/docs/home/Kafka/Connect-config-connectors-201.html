Kafka Connect 2.0.1: Connector Configuration

   This section describes how and where connectors are configured.

   Connector configurations are key-value mappings. For standalone mode,
   these parameters are defined in a properties file and passed to the
   Connect process on the command line. In distributed mode, they will be
   included in the JSON payload for the request that creates (or modifies)
   the connector. Most configurations are connector dependent, but there
   are a few settings common to all connectors:
     * name - Unique name for the connector. Attempting to register again
       with the same name will fail.
     * connector.class - The Java class for the connector
     * tasks.max - The maximum number of tasks that should be created for
       this connector. The connector may create fewer tasks if it cannot
       achieve this level of parallelism.

   Sink connectors also have one additional option to control their input:
     * topics - A list of topics to use as input for this connector

   For other options, consult the documentation for the JDBC and HDFS
   connectors. See [1]Kafka Connect 2.0.1: JDBC Connector and [2]Kafka
   Connect 2.0.1: HDFS Connector.
