Kafka Connect 2.0.1: Distributed Worker Configuration Options

   This topic describes the worker parameters that are specific to
   distributed configurations. Distributed mode is supported on MapR 5.2.1
   and above.

   In addition to the common worker configuration options, the following
   are available in distributed mode. These parameters are set in the
   connect-distributed.properties file.

   CAPTION: Table 1. Distributed Worker Configuration Parameters

   Parameter Description Type Default

   group.id

   A unique string that identifies the Connect cluster group that the
   worker belongs to.
   string    “”

   config.storage.topic

   The MapR-ES topic to store connector and task configuration data in.
   This must be the same for all workers with the same group.id.
   string    “”

   offset.storage.topic

   The MapR-ES topic to store offset data for connectors in. This must be
   the same for all workers with the same group.id.
   string    “”

   heartbeat.interval.ms

   The expected time between heartbeats to the group coordinator when
   using Kafka’s group management facilities.

   Heartbeats are used to ensure that the worker’s session stays active
   and to facilitate rebalancing when new members join or leave the group.
   The value must be set lower than session.timeout.ms, but typically
   should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even
   lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.
   int       3000

   session.timeout.ms

   The timeout used to detect failures when using Kafka’s group management
   facilities.
   int       30000

   connections.max.idle.ms

   Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by
   this config.
   long      540000

   receive.buffer.bytes

   The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading
   data.
   int       32768

   request.timeout.ms

   The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will
   wait for the response of a request.

   If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client
   will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are
   exhausted.
   int       40000

   send.buffer.bytes

   The size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use when sending data.
   int       131072

   worker.sync.timeout.ms

   When the worker is out of sync with other workers and needs to
   resynchronize configurations, wait up to this amount of time before
   giving up, leaving the group, and waiting a backoff period before
   rejoining.
   int       3000

   worker.unsync.backoff.ms

   When the worker is out of sync with other workers and fails to catch up
   within worker.sync.timeout.ms, leave the Connect cluster for this long
   before rejoining.
   int       300000

   client.id

   An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of
   this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just IP/port
   by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side
   request logging.
   string    “”

   metadata.max.age.ms

   The period of time in milliseconds after which we force a refresh of
   metadata even if we haven’t seen any partition leadership changes to
   proactively discover any new brokers or partitions.
   long      300000

   metric.reporters

   A list of classes to use as metrics reporters. Implementing the
   MetricReporterinterface allows plugging in classes that will be
   notified of new metric creation. The JmxReporter is always included to
   register JMX statistics.
   list      []

   metrics.num.samples

   The number of samples maintained to compute metrics.
   int       2

   metrics.sample.window.ms

   The number of samples maintained to compute metrics.
   long      30000

   reconnect.backoff.ms

   The amount of time to wait before attempting to reconnect to a given
   host. This avoids repeatedly connecting to a host in a tight loop. This
   backoff applies to all requests sent by the consumer to the broker.
   long      50

   retry.backoff.ms

   The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed fetch
   request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeated
   fetching-and-failing in a tight loop.
   long      100
