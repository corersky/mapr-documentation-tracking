JDBC Driver

   Kafka Connect for MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka provides a JDBC
   driver jar along with the connector configuration.

   The JDBC driver (kafka-connect-jdbc) is set up by specifying the
   CLASSPATH variable. See [1]Installing MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   Tools.

   The packaged connector is installed in the
   share/java/kafka-connect-jdbc directory, relative to the installation
   directory.
   Alternatively, to add a new driver to the CLASSPATH,
    1. Put the classpath of the connectors in the kafka-connect-jdbc
       directory:
/opt/mapr/kafka-connect-jdbc/kafka-connect-jdbc-<connector version>/share/java/k
afka-connect-jdbc/
    2. Create a symlink into the share/java/kafka-connect-jdbc/ directory.
