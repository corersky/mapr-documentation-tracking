Kafka Connect 4.0.0

   Kafka Connect is a utility for streaming data between MapR-ES and other
   storage systems.

   Examples of other systems include:
     * Relational databases
     * Logs and metrics
     * Hadoop and data warehouses
     * NoSQL data stores

   Kafka Connect makes it easy to integrate all your data via Kafka,
   making it available as realtime streams. For example, you can use Kafka
   Connect to:
     * Stream changes from a relational database to make events available
       with low latency for stream processing applications.
     * Import realtime logs and metrics into MapR-ES and process them to
       detect anomalies.
     * Implement a process of loading data into MapR-ES from your primary
       data storage systems, performing filtering, transformations, and
       enrichment with a MapR Stream processing framework, and publish the
       data to MapR-FS.

   Note: Built-in security is not available.
