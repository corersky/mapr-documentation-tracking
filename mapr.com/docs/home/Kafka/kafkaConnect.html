Kafka Connect

   Kafka Connect is a utility for streaming data between MapR Event Store
   For Apache Kafka and other storage systems.

   Examples of other systems include:
     * Relational databases
     * Logs and metrics
     * Hadoop and data warehouses
     * NoSQL data stores

   Kafka Connect makes it easy to integrate all your data via Kafka,
   making it available as realtime streams. For example, you can use Kafka
   Connect to:
     * Stream changes from a relational database to make events available
       with low latency for stream processing applications.
     * Import realtime logs and metrics into MapR Event Store For Apache
       Kafka and process them to detect anomalies.
     * Implement a process of loading data into MapR Event Store For
       Apache Kafka from your primary data storage systems, performing
       filtering, transformations, and enrichment with a MapR Stream
       processing framework, and publish the data to MapR file system.

   Note: Built-in security is not available.
