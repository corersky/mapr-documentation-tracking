Application Reset Tool

   This tool allows your to reset an application and force it to reprocess
   its data from scratch by using the application reset tool. This tool
   can be useful for development and testing, or when fixing bugs.

Description

   The application reset tool (ART) handles the Kafka Streams user topics
   (input, output, and intermediate topics) and internal topics
   differently when resetting the application.

   The application reset tool does the following for each topic type:
     * Input topics: Reset to the beginning of the topic. This means that
       it sets the application’s committed consumer offsets for all
       partitions to each partition’s earliest offset (for consumer group
       application.id).
     * Intermediate topics: Skip to the end of the topic, i.e., set the
       application’s committed consumer offsets for all partitions to each
       partition’s logSize (for consumer group application.id).
     * Internal topics: Delete the internal topic (this automatically
       deletes any committed offsets).

   The application reset tool does not do the following:
     * Reset output topics of an application. If any output (or
       intermediate) topics are consumed by downstream applications, it is
       your responsibility to adjust those downstream applications as
       appropriate when you reset the upstream application.
     * Reset the local environment of your application instances. It is
       your responsibility to delete the local state on any machine on
       which an application instance was run.

   See [1]Confluent Application Reset Tool for additional reference
   information.

Running the Application Reset Tool

   Invoke the application reset tool from the command line:
/opt/mapr/bin/kafka-streams-application-reset

   The tool accepts the following parameters:
   Note: Parameters can be combined as needed. For example, if you want to
   restart an application from an empty internal state, but not reprocess
   previous data, simply omit the --input-topics and --intermediate-topics
   parameters.

   CAPTION:

   Option Description
   --application-id <String: id> (Required) The Kafka Streams application
   ID (application.id).
   --default-stream The default stream that is used when the topic name is
   specified but the stream name is not.
   --config-file <String: file name> Property file containing configs to
   be passed to admin clients and embedded consumer.
   --dry-run Display the actions that would be performed without executing
   the reset commands.
   --input-topics <String: list> Comma-separated list of user input
   topics. For these topics, the tool will reset the offset to the
   earliest available offset.
   --intermediate-topics <String: list> Comma-separated list of
   intermediate user topics (topics used in the through() method). For
   these topics, the tool will skip to the end.

Resetting your Local Environments

   To reset the local environments of your application instances, you must
   delete your application’s local state directory on any machines where
   the application instance was run. You must do this before restarting an
   application instance on the same machine. You can use either of these
   methods:
   Note: This a a complete application reset
   The API method KafkaStreams#cleanUp() in your application code.
   Manually delete the corresponding local state directory (default
   location: /tmp/kafka-streams/<application.id>). For more information,
   see state.dir StreamsConfig class.

Example

   In this example you are developing and testing an application locally
   and you want to iteratively improve your application via
   run-reset-modify cycles.
package mapr.examples.streams;

import ...;

public class ResetDemo {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  // Kafka Streams configuration
    Properties streamsConfiguration = new Properties();
    streamsConfiguration.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "my-streams-ap
p");
    // ...and so on...

    // Define the processing topology
    StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
    builder.stream("my-input-topic")
        .selectKey(...)
        .through("rekeyed-topic")
        .countByKey("global-count")
        .to("my-output-topic");

    KStreams app = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), streamsConfiguration);

    // Delete the application's local state.
    // Note: In real application you'd call `cleanUp()` only under
    // certain conditions.  See tip on `cleanUp()` below.
    app.cleanUp();

    app.start();

    // Note: In real applications you would register a shutdown hook
    // that would trigger the call to `app.close()` rather than
    // using the sleep-then-close example we show here.
    Thread.sleep(30 * 1000L);
    app.close();
  }

}

   You can then perform run-reset-modify cycles as follows:
# Run your application
$ bin/kafka-run-class mapr.examples.streams.ResetDemo

# After stopping all application instances, reset the application
$ bin/kstreams-application-reset --application-id my-streams-app \
                                 --input-topics my-input-topic \
                                 --intermediate-topics rekeyed-topic

# Now you can modify/recompile as needed and then re-run the application again.
# You can also experiment, for example, with different input data without
# modifying the application.
