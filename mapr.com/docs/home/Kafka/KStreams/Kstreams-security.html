Kafka Streams Security

   Discusses Kafka Streams security topics.

Internal Topics

   All Kafka Streams application’s internal topics are grouped in the
   Kafka Streams application directory: /apps/kafka-streams.
     * The /apps directory has only write access to mapr user. The
       /apps/kafka-streams directory is not modifiable/deletable by any
       user other than mapr user.
     * All users can create sub-directories inside the /apps/kafka-streams
       directory. Only the following users have read/write/delete
       permission for sub-directories or files created in this directory.
          + mapr user
          + Current user of the sub-directory:
               o If security is enabled, the current user is the MapR
                 ticket identity. See [1]Managing Tickets for more
                 information.
               o If security is not enabled, the current MapR identity.

Kafka Streams Application Specific Folders

   Some Kafka Streams applications need to create internal topics. These
   topics are created in the /apps/kafka-streams/<application.id>
   directory.
   Important: This directory is created at runtime by the Kafka Streams
   application and can only be modified by the current user or super
   users. This directory can only be deleted by the [2]Application Reset
   Tool (ART) and, again, by only the current user or super users.

Application Reset Tool and Cleanup APIs

   The application reset tool allows to reset a Kafka Streams
   application's internal state, such that it can re-process its input
   data from scratch. Kafka Streams internal topics can be cleaned using
   application reset tool.

   Only the current user of the Kafka Streams application or mapr user has
   permissions to clean up a Kafka Streams application using Application
   Reset Tool. The Application Reset Tool is integrated with the cleanup
   APIs so that the application’s internal topics are prefixed with the
   same directory.

   The application reset tool takes application.id as the input for
   cleaning up Kafka Streams application. As part of this process, all
   internal-topics are deleted for the application user under the
   /apps/kafka-streams/<application.id> directory, including the
   /apps/kafka-streams/<application.id> directory. See [3]Application
   Reset Tool for more information.
