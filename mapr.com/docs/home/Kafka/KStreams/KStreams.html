Kafka Streams

   Kafka Streams is a programming library used for creating Java or Scala
   streaming applications and, specifically, building streaming
   applications that transform input topics into output topics.

   Kafka Streams allows you to build moderately complex operational
   streaming applications faster by offloading common functions such as
   failure recovery, joins and enrichment, and aggregations and windowing.

   Kafka Streams application is a distributed Java application that is
   launched with one or more Kafka Streams application instances. Kafka
   Streams applications can be build using the KStream library. A KStream
   application instance is required to be provided with an application.id
   property. The application.id property uniquely identifies the Kafka
   Streams distributed application.
   Attention: The Kafka Streams application must alway be launched as the
   same user.

Architecture

   An application that uses the Kafka Streams API is a normal Java
   application. Package, deploy, and monitor it like you would do for any
   other Java application. There is no need to install separate processing
   clusters or similar special-purpose and expensive infrastructure.
   Note: You can run one or more instances of your application. They run
   independently but will automatically discover each other and
   collaborate. In addition, you can elastically add and remove
   application instances during live opeations. If one instance dies, then
   the other instances will take over its work.

   The following diagram shows an application that is running three (3)
   application instances.
