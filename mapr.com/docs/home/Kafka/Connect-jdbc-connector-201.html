Kafka Connect 2.0.1: JDBC Connector

   The topics describes the JDBC connector, drivers, and configuration
   parameters.

   The JDBC connector allows you to import data from any relational
   database with a JDBC driver into MapR-ES. By using JDBC, this connector
   can support a wide variety of databases without requiring custom code
   for each one.

   The JDBC connector provides flexibility regarding which databases you
   can import data from and how that data is imported. JDBC connector
   implements the data copying functionality on the generic JDBC APIs, and
   relies on JDBC drivers to handle the database-specific implementation
   of those APIs.
