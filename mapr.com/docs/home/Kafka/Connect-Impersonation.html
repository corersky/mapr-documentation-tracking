User Impersonation

   Describes how to disable, enable, and use impersonation with Kafka
   Connect.

   User impersonation enables Kafka Connect jobs to be submitted as a
   particular user. Without impersonation, Kafka Connect submits jobs as
   the user that started the worker

   On a MapR cluster, the impersonated user is typically the mapr user or
   the user specified in the MAPR_USER environment variable. By default,
   impersonation and PAM authentication in Kafka Connect are enabled on
   all types of security.

Disabling User Impersonation

   To disable user impersonation, you need to first disable the PAM
   authentication properties in the connect-distributed.properties file
   and then disable the connect.proxy.enable.doAs property.
    1. Disable PAM authentication. Set the following properties in
       opt/mapr/kafka/kafka-<version>/config/connect-distributed.propertie
       s:
          + authentication.method=NONE
    2. Once authentication is disabled, set the following property in
       /opt/mapr/kafka/kafka-<version>/config/connect-distributed.properti
       es:
          + connect.proxy.enable.doAs=false
