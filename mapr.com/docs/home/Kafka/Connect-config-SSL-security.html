SSL Security Configuration

   Describes how to configure Kafka Connect security on a MapR cluster.

Secure by Default

   As of MapR 6.0, the MapR Installer performs the Kafka Connect
   configuration for new installations. This means that:
     * If MapR core is installed as secure, then Kafka Connect is also
       installed as secure.
     * If MapR core is installed as unsecure, then Kafka Connect is also
       installed as unsecure.

   Important: In addition, every time the MapR configuration script is run
   with the -R option (configure.sh -R), the default settings for MapR
   core are re-established.

   This means that if you manually configure Kafka Connect for unsecure on
   a secure MapR core, Kafka Connect will revert back to secure when
   configure.sh -R is run.

Manually Securing Kafka Connect Only

   CAUTION:
   This configuration is not a typical configuration.

   If you have an unsecure MapR cluster, and you want to secure Kafka
   Connect, do the following:
    1. Generate the server and client certificates.
    2. Add any necessary property configurations to the
       connect-distributed.properties configuration file. For example:
listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8083
            ssl.keystore.location=<ssl-keystore-path>
            ssl.keystore.password=<ssl-keystore-password>
            ssl.key.password=<ssl-keystore-password>
    3. Restart Kafka Connect.
maprcli node services -name kafka-connect -action restart -nodes <space delimite
d list of nodes>
    4. Run a curl command to ensure that HTTPS is enabled.
curl -X GET https://node1:8083/connectors --cacert <certificate-path>

Manually Unsecuring Kafka Connect

   Warning: This scenario is NOT recommended or supported.

   If you have an secure MapR cluster, and you want to unsecure Kafka
   Connect, do the following:
    1. In the connect-distributed.properties configuration file, change
       https:// to http:// for the listeners and remove the ssl.*
       properties. For example:
listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8083
    2. Restart Kafka Connect.
maprcli node services -name kafka-connect -action restart -nodes <space delimite
d list of nodes>
