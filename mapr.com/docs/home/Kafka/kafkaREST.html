Kafka REST Proxy 4.0.0

   The Kafka REST Proxy provides a RESTful interface to MapR-ES clusters
   to consume and produce messages and to perform administrative
   operations.

   It allows you to:
     * Consume messages from topics or concrete topic partitions.
     * Produce messages to topics or partitions.
     * View the state of the cluster.

   Use cases include ingesting messages into a stream processing framework
   and scripting administrative operations.

   Note: The Kafka REST Proxy can be subscribed only once and only for a
   single topic.
