REST API

   The Kafka Connect REST API for MapR-ES manages connectors.

   In standalone mode, a connector request is submitted on the command
   line. This mode is useful for getting status information, adding and
   removing connectors without stopping the process, and testing and
   debugging.

   In distributed mode, the REST API is the primary interface to the
   cluster. Requests can be made to any cluster member where the REST API
   automatically forwards requests.

   Content Types
   The REST API supports application/json as both the request and response
   entity content type. For example:
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

   Status & Errors

   The REST API returns standards-compliant HTTP statuses.
   Note: By default, the Kafka Connect REST API for MapR-ES service in run
   on port 8083.
