KSQL

   KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine that implements continuous,
   interactive queries.

   KSQL allows you to query, read, write, and process data in real-time,
   at scale using SQL commands. KSQL interacts directly with the [1]Kafka
   Streams API, removing the requirement of building a Java application.

   The KSQL data flow architecture is designed where the user interacts
   with the KSQL server and, in turn, the KSQL server interacts with the
   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka server.

Use Cases

   Common use cases include fraud detection, personalization,
   notifications, real-time analytics, and sensor data and IoT.

Architecture

   There is a KSQL server process which executes queries. A set of KSQL
   processes run as a cluster. You can dynamically add more processing
   capacity by starting more instances of the KSQL server. These instances
   are fault-tolerant: if one fails, the others will take over its work.
   Queries are launched using the interactive KSQL command line client
   which sends commands to the cluster over a REST API. The command line
   allows you to inspect the available streams and tables, issue new
   queries, check the status of and terminate running queries.

   KSQL Server
          The KSQL server runs the engine that executes KSQL queries. This
          includes processing, reading, and writing data to and from the
          target Kafka cluster. KSQL servers form KSQL clusters and can
          run in containers, virtual machines, and bare-metal machines.
          You can add and remove servers to/from the same KSQL cluster
          during live operations to elastically scale KSQL’s processing
          capacity as desired. You can deploy different KSQL clusters to
          achieve workload isolation.

   KSQL CLI
          You can interactively write KSQL queries by using the KSQL
          command line interface (CLI). The KSQL CLI acts as a client to
          the KSQL server.

Non-Interactive vs. Interactive Mode

   In MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka, non-interactive KSQL clusters
   (headless mode) is the main deployment model for KSQL queries (similar
   to the Apache Kafka model). In particular, MapR only supports
   production scenarios that run in non-interactive “headless” mode.

   Non-interactive mode supports locked-down, “headless” deployment
   scenarios where interactive use of the KSQL cluster is disabled,
   thereby preventing KSQL CLI access. When deploying queries, headless
   deployment allows you to lock-down access to KSQL servers,
   version-control the exact queries, and store them in a .sql file. This
   prevents users from interacting directly with the production KSQL
   cluster.

   Interactive KSQL clusters is not supported in a production environment.
   However, interactive mode may be useful by, for example, allowing a
   team of users to develop and verify their queries interactively on a
   shared testing KSQL cluster. Interactive KSQL clusters require that the
   authenticated KSQL user has open access to create, read, write, delete
   topics, and use any consumer group. When deploying those queries in
   your production environment, you want to lock-down access to KSQL
   servers by deploying a non-interactive (headless) environment.
   Important: SSL/TLS is not supported between the KSQL client and the
   KSQL server. [2]KSQL Security for more information.
