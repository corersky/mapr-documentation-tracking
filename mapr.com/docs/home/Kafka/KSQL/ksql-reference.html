KSQL Reference

   KSQL-specific commands are commands for setting your KSQL
   configuration, exiting the CLI, and so on.
   Run the KSQL with --help to see the available options.
./bin/ksql --help

   CLI commands include:
     * help
     * clear
     * output
     * output <format>
     * history
     * version
     * exit

   KSQL is started by issuing the ./bin/ksql command and the KSQL
   statements are run in the KSQL command line once it starts.
