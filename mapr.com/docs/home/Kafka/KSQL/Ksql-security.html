KSQL Security

   Discusses KSQL security topics.

Non-interactive Clusters (headless mode)

   In MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka, the non-interactive mode is the
   main deployment model for KSQL queries (similar to the Apache Kafka
   model). You are responsible for deploying your own KSQL server clusters
   with KSQL queries.
   Important: MapRâ€™s ticket-based security is used for communication
   between a KSQL Server and MapR Server.

Interactive KSQL Clusters

   The MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka implementation does not perform
   any impersonation on behalf of KSQL CLI users in KSQL Servers. SSL/TLS
   protocols are not supported between KSQL CLI and KSQL Servers. It is
   not possible to transmit user credentials (username, password)
   securely. Interactive mode is not supported or recommended for
   production. Use headless mode.
   Important: Security Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) protocols are not supported between the KSQL client and the KSQL
   server. When using KSQL in interactive mode, user credentials
   (username, password) are not passed. For production environments, use
   headless mode. See the Non-Interactive (Headless) KSQL Usage section in
   [1]Configuring Apache Kafka KSQL Server for more information.

KSQL_COMMANDS

   The KSQL_COMMANDS internal topic is used to backup information about
   KSQL streams, KSQL tables, KSQL persistent queries, and so on. KSQL
   uses KSQL_COMMANDS to restore KSQL server state in case there is a
   fault or server restart.

   Each KSQL Server cluster has a unique servise ID which can be provided
   by using the ksql.service.id property. By default, the service.id is
   _default. To provide additional security, kql.service.id-specific
   folders are created in the ksql-internal-stream stream.
   Note: The /apps directory has only write access to mapr user. So the
   /apps/ksql directory can not be modifiable/deletable by any user other
   than mapr user.

   KSQL service.id-specific folders are created in the /apps/ksql/
   directory for every KSQL server cluster (represented by
   ksql.service.id).

Default Stream

   KSQL Server provides a default stream for topics when they are being
   processed. When KSQL Server is not impersonated (non-interactive or
   interactive+no-impersonation), the KSQL Server default stream is used.

KSQL Cleanup

   The KSQL cleanup feature is integrated to ensure that the underlying
   KSQL state (such as internal topics) are cleaned up correctly. See
   [2]Application Reset Tool for more information.

Deployment

   MapR KSQL deployment model is the same as Apache Kafka's deployment
   model. The KSQL Servers are not managed as part of the MapR cluster
   (for example, mapr-warden); you are required to run (or manage) your
   own KSQL Servers.
   Note: A service ID (service.id) is uniquely created for the KSQL
   implementation; this means that the user associated with the service ID
   cannot grant permissions to other users to use the same service ID.
