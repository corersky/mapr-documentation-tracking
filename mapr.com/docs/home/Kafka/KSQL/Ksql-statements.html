KSQL Statements

General Syntax

   KSQL is started by issuing the ./bin/ksql command and the KSQL
   statements are run in the KSQL command line once it starts.

   KSQL statements must be terminated with a semicolon (;).
   For multi-line statements:
     * In the CLI, you use a back-slash (\) to indicate continuation of a
       statement on the next line.
     * Do not use backslashes (\) for multi-line statements in .sql files.
