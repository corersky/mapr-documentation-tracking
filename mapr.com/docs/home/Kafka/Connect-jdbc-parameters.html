JDBC Configuration Options

   Use the following parameters to configure the Kafka Connect for MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka JDBC connector; they are modified in the
   quickstart-sqlite.properties file.

Configuration Modes

   In standalone mode, JDBC connector configuration is specified in the
   quickstart-sqlite.properties file. Additional configurations such as
   the offset storage location and the port for the REST interface are
   specified in the connect-standalone.properties file. See [1]Configuring
   in Standalone Mode.
/opt/mapr/kafka-connect-jdbc/kafka-connect-jdbc-4.0.0/etc/kafka-connect-jdbc/qui
ckstart-sqlite.properties
/opt/mapr/kafka/kafka-1.0/config/connect-standalone.properties

   In distributed mode, HDFS connector configuration is provided in the
   POST and PUT requests when creating or modifying the connector. See
   [2]POST /connectors and [3]PUT /connectors/(string:name)/config for
   more information about using the REST API. Additional configurations
   such as defining the topics that will store the connector state, task
   configuration state, and connector offset state are specified in the
   connect-distributed.properties file. See [4]Configuring in Distributed
   Mode .

JDBC Source Configuration Options

   CAPTION: Table 1. JDBC Source configuration parameters

   Parameters Description

   connection.url

   JDBC connection URL for the database to load.
     * Type: string
     * Default: “”

   connection.user

   JDBC connection user.
     * Type: string
     * Default: NULL

   connection.password

   JDBC connection password.
     * Type: password
     * Default: NULL

   connection.attempts
   Maximum number of attempts to retrieve a valid JDBC connection.
     * Type: int
     * Default: 3

   connection.backoff.ms
   Backoff time in milliseconds between connection attempts.
     * Type: long
     * Default: 10000

   table.whitelist

   List of tables to include in copying. If specified, table.blacklist may
   not be set.
     * Type: list
     * Default: []

   table.blacklist

   List of tables to exclude from copying. If specified, table.whitelist
   may not be set.
     * Type: list
     * Default: []

   numeric.precision.mapping

   Whether or not to attempt mapping numeric values by precision to
   integral types.
     * Type: boolean
     * Default: false

   schema.pattern Schema pattern to fetch table metadata from the
   database.

   "" - Retrieves those without a schema.

   * - NULL (default) means that the schema name should not be used to
   narrow the search, all tables metadata would be fetched, regardless
   their schema.

   mode

   The mode for updating a table each time it is polled. Options include:
     * bulk - perform a bulk load of the entire table each time it is
       polled.
     * incrementing - use a strictly incrementing column on each table to
       detect only new rows. Note that this will not detect modifications
       or deletions of existing rows.
     * timestamp - use a timestamp (or timestamp-like) column to detect
       new and modified rows. This assumes the column is updated with each
       write, and that values are monotonically incrementing, but not
       necessarily unique.
     * timestamp+incrementing - use two columns, a timestamp column that
       detects new and modified rows and a strictly incrementing column
       which provides a globally unique ID for updates so each row can be
       assigned a unique stream offset.
     * Type: string
     * Default: “”

   Valid Values: [, bulk, timestamp, incrementing, timestamp+incrementing]
   The name of the strictly incrementing column to use to detect new rows.
   Any empty value indicates the column should be autodetected by looking
   for an autoincrementing column. This column may not be nullable.
     * Type: string
     * Default: “”

   Note: If you are using Hive JDBC with incrementing or timestamp mode,
   you should set the validate.non.null property to false because there
   are no "not null" columns in Hive.

   timestamp.column.name

   The name of the timestamp column to use to detect new or modified rows.
   This column may not be nullable.
     * Type: string
     * Default: “”

   validate.non.null

   By default, the JDBC connector will validate that all incrementing and
   timestamp tables have NOT NULL set for the columns being used as their
   ID/timestamp. If the tables don’t, JDBC connector will fail to start.
   Setting this to false will disable these checks.
     * Type: boolean
     * Default: true

   Note: If this parameter is false, specify exactly all columns that need
   to be imported to MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka in the query
   parameter. For example instead of "query" : "select * from table", use
   "query" : "select col1, col2 from table"

   incrementing.column.name

   The name of the strictly incrementing column to use to detect new rows.
   Any empty value indicates the column should be autodetected by looking
   for an auto-incrementing column. This column may not be nullable.
     * Type: string
     * Default: “”

   query

   If specified, the query to perform to select new or updated rows. Use
   this setting to join tables, select subsets of columns in a table, or
   filter data. If used, this connector will only copy data using this
   query – whole-table copying will be disabled. Different query modes may
   still be used for incremental updates, but in order to properly
   construct the incremental query, it must be possible to append a WHERE
   clause to this query (i.e. no WHERE clauses may be used). If you use a
   WHERE clause, it must handle incremental queries itself.
     * Type: string
     * Default: “”

   poll.interval.ms

   Frequency (milliseconds) to poll for new data in each table.
     * Type: int
     * Default: 5000

   batch.max.rows

   Maximum number of rows to include in a single batch when polling for
   new data. This setting can be used to limit the amount of data buffered
   internally in the connector.
     * Type: int
     * Default: 100

   table.poll.interval.ms

   Frequency (milliseconds) to poll for new or removed tables, which may
   result in updated task configurations to start polling for data in
   added tables or stop polling for data in removed tables.
     * Type: long
     * Default: 60000

   topic.prefix

   Prefix to prepend to table names to generate the name of the Kafka
   topic to publish data to, or in the case of a custom query, the full
   name of the topic to publish to. For example:
   /path/to/stream:topic-prefix-.
     * Type: string
     * Default: “”

   table.types By default, the JDBC connector will only detect tables with
   type TABLE from the source Database. This config allows a command
   separated list of table types to extract. Options include:
     * TABLE
     * VIEW
     * SYSTEM TABLE
     * GLOBAL TEMPORARY
     * LOCAL TEMPORY
     * ALIAS
     * SYNONYM

   Typically, TABLE or VIEW are used.
     * Type: list
     * Default: TABLE

   timestamp.delay.interval.ms How long to wait after a row with certain
   timestamp appears before it is included in the result. You may choose
   to add some delay to allow transactions with earlier timestamp to
   complete. The first execution fetches all available records (for
   example, starting at timestamp 0) until the current time minus the
   delay. Every following execution retrieves data from the last time data
   was fetched until the current time minus the delay.
     * Type: long
     * Default: 0

       database if it is supported by the connector. For example: UPDATE

     * Type: string
     * Default: INSERT
     * Valid Values: insert, upsert, update

   batch.size Specifies how many records to attempt to batch together for
   insertion into the destination table, when possible.
     * Type: int
     * Default: 3000
     * Valid Values: 0,...

   table.name.format A format string for the destination table name, which
   may contain ${topic} as a placeholder for the originating topic name.
   For example, table_${topic} for the topic orders maps to the table name
   table_orders.
     * Type: string
     * Default: ${topic}

   pk.mode The primary key mode, also refer to pk.fields documentation for
   interplay. Supported modes are:
     * none - No keys utilized.

     * record_key - Field(s) from the record key are used, which may be a
       primitive or a struct.
     * record_value - Field(s) from the record value are used, which must
       be a struct.

     * Type: string
     * Default: non
     * Valid Values: none, kafka, record_key, record_value

   pk.fields List of comma-separated primary key field names. The runtime
   interpretation of this config depends on the pk.mode:
     * none - Ignored as no fields are used as primary key in thes mode.
     * kafka - Must be a trio representing the Kafka coordinates. Defaults
       to __connect_topic,__connect_partition,__connect_offset if empty.
     * record_key - If empty, all fields from the key struct will be used,
       otherwise used to extract the desired fields - for primitive key
       only a single field name must be configured.
     * record_value - If empty, all fields from the value struct will be
       used, otherwise used to extract the desired fields.

     * Type: list
     * Default: ""

   fields.whitelist List of comma-separated record value field names. If
   empty, all fields from the record value are utilized, otherwise used to
   filter to the desired fields. Note: pk.fields is applied independently
   in the context of which field(s) form the primary key columns in the
   destination database, while this configuration is applicable for the
   other columns.
