Configuring Gateways for Table and Stream Replication

   Configuring gateways involves installing the mapr-gateway package on
   nodes in a MapR destination cluster and then configuring the MapR
   source cluster to communicate with the destination cluster. The Mapr
   source cluster is configured by specifying the destination cluster's
   CLDB node and gateway nodes.

   Although it is possible to use a single gateway, the recommended
   practice is to configure at least two (2), so that replication can
   continue if a gateway fails. MapR source clusters distribute requests
   among the gateways in a round-robin fashion. See [1]Gateways for
   Replicating MapR-DB Tables, [2]Table Replication, and [3]Preparing
   Clusters for Stream Replication for more information about replication.

   See [4]Setting Up Cross-Cluster Security for more information about
   setting up cross-cluster security including cross-cluster security for
   table and stream replication.
    1. On the destination cluster, install the mapr-gateway package on
       each node where you want to run a gateway on. See [5]Installing
       MapR Software.
       Note: On the gateway nodes in the destination cluster, when you run
       (or re-run) the configure.sh script (in addition to your regular
       parameters) be sure to specify the -N parameter with the name of
       the cluster that the gateway belongs to. See [6]configure.sh for
       more information about configure.sh usage, options, and examples.
    2. If you want to change the port that a gateway is using (by default,
       gateways use port 7660):
         a. On the node where the gateway is running, edit the
            /opt/mapr/conf/gateway.conf file, uncommenting the line
            #gateway.port=7660 and changing the port number.
         b. After saving the file, restart the gateway by running this
            command: maprcli node services -name gateway -action restart
    3. On the source cluster, specify the destination cluster's name and
       gateway nodes by using one of the following methods. See
       [7]Managing Gateways for more information about using these
       methods.
          + Running the maprcli cluster gateway set command.
maprcli cluster gateway set -dstcluster <cluster name> -gateways "<space-delimit
ed list of gateways>"
          + Adding a DNS record to your DNS server's zone file for your
            domain.
