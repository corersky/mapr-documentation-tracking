Configuring Gateways for Table and Stream Replication

   Configuring gateways involves installing the mapr-gateway package on
   nodes in a MapR destination cluster and then configuring the MapR
   source cluster to communicate with the destination cluster. The MapR
   source cluster is configured by specifying the destination cluster's
   CLDB node and gateway nodes.

   Although it is possible to use a single gateway, the recommended
   practice is to configure at least two (2), so that replication can
   continue if a gateway fails. MapR source clusters distribute requests
   among the gateways in a round-robin fashion. See [1]Gateways for
   Replicating MapR Database Tables, [2]Table Replication, and
   [3]Preparing Clusters for Stream Replication for more information about
   replication.

   See [4]Setting Up Cross-Cluster Security for more information about
   setting up cross-cluster security including cross-cluster security for
   table and stream replication.
    1. On the destination cluster, install the mapr-gateway package on
       each node where you want to run a gateway on. See [5]Installing
       MapR Software.
       Note: On the gateway nodes in the destination cluster, when you run
       (or re-run) the configure.sh script (in addition to your regular
       parameters) be sure to specify the -N parameter with the name of
       the cluster that the gateway belongs to. See [6]configure.sh for
       more information about configure.sh usage, options, and examples.
    2. To change the port that a gateway uses (by default, gateways use
       port 7660):
         a. On the node where the gateway is running, edit the
            /opt/mapr/conf/gateway.conf file, uncommenting the line
            #gateway.port=7660 and changing the port number. For more
            information about gateway.conf configuration properties, see
            [7]gateway.conf.
         b. After saving the file, restart the gateway by running this
            command: maprcli node services -name gateway -action restart
    3. On the source cluster, specify the destination cluster's name and
       gateway nodes by using one of the following methods:
          + Run the maprcli cluster gateway set command:
maprcli cluster gateway set -dstcluster <cluster name> -gateways <space-delimite
d list of gateways>
            The following sample command sets two gateway nodes on the
            destination cluster my.cluster.com:
maprcli cluster gateway set -dstcluster my.cluster.com -gateways node1.com node2
.com
          + Add a DNS record to your DNS server's zone file for your
            domain.
       If you do not perform one of these options, MapR Database uses
       configuration from the mapr-clusters.conf file. It uses the cluster
       name specified in that file as the destination cluster and the CLDB
       node addresses as the gateway nodes. You must have gateways running
       on these CLDB nodes.
       See [8]Managing Gateways for more information about using these
       methods.
