Administering MapR Gateways

   A MapR gateway mediates one-way communication between a source MapR
   cluster and a destination cluster. You can replicate MapR-DB tables
   (binary and JSON) and MapR-ES streams. MapR gateways also apply updates
   from JSON tables to their secondary indexes and propagate Change Data
   Capture (CDC) logs.

   The initial task for setting up your gateways is to decide where you
   want to put them:
     * If you are going to replicate MapR-DB tables, see [1]Gateways for
       Replicating MapR-DB Tables.
     * If you are going to replicate streams, see [2]Gateways and Stream
       Replication.
     * If your MapR-DB JSON tables have secondary indexes, see
       [3]Preparing Clusters for Querying using Secondary Indexes on JSON
       Tables.
     * If you are using CDC, see [4]Getting Started with CDC.

   Note: Gateways perform negligible disk I/O and use negligible amounts
   of memory, though gateways require significant CPU usage.

   However, the resource that gateways use the most is network bytes. For
   example, if the peak network throughput for puts is about 40 MB per
   second per node, in a 10-node source cluster the peak network
   throughput will be about 400 MB per second. So, the aggregate network
   throughput required on the nodes running gateways will be 400 MB per
   second for both incoming and outgoing traffic. The aggregate network
   throughput for a on 50 node cluster would be 2GB per second.

   For another example, in this diagram there are two source clusters of
   three nodes each and the clusters are replicating to one destination
   cluster. The peak traffic on the gateways will be 40MB per second per
   cluster node, which means that these gateways together will experience
   a peak network load of 240MB per second.

   Although the load is balanced across the two gateways, so that each
   gateway experiences a peak network load of 120MB per second, each
   gateway should be able to tolerate the full aggregate network load in
   case the other gateway fails unexpectedly.
