Managing Gateways

   This topic describes various methods for listing gateways, checking
   status of gateways, managing gateways if they fail, and troubleshooting
   gateways.

   The following lists commands you can run to perform operations on your
   gateways.
   Note: If you have configured an intra-cluster gateway, the source and
   destination clusters are the same.
     * To see a list of the gateways for a particular destination cluster:
       Run the [1]maprcli cluster gateway get command on the source
       cluster. Specify the name of the destination cluster with the
       -dstcluster parameter. If you run the command remotely from your
       source cluster, specify the name of the source cluster with the
       -cluster parameter.
     * To see a list of the gateways for all of the destination clusters
       that the source cluster is replicating to:
       Run the [2]maprcli cluster gateway list command on the source
       cluster. If you run the command remotely from your source cluster,
       specify the name of the source cluster with the -cluster parameter.
     * To remove the list of gateways that you specified for a destination
       cluster by using the maprcli cluster gateway set command:
       Run the [3]maprcli cluster gateway delete command on the source
       cluster. Specify the name of the destination cluster with the
       -dstcluster parameter. If you run the command remotely from your
       source cluster, specify the name of the source cluster with the
       -cluster parameter.
     * To find out how MapR-DB or MapR-ES is finding gateways (for
       example, from DNS records, lists created by the maprcli cluster
       gateway set command or the mapr-clusters.conf file):
       Run the command [4]maprcli cluster gateway resolve on the source
       cluster. Specify the name of the destination cluster with the
       -dstcluster parameter. If you run the command remotely from your
       source cluster, specify the name of the source cluster with the
       -cluster parameter.
     * To stop and start one or more gateways:
       Run the maprcli node services -name gateway -action stop|start on
       the clusters where the gateways are running.
maprcli node services -name gateway -action stop -nodes <hostnames or IP address
es separated by spaces>
maprcli node services -name gateway -action start -nodes <hostnames or IP addres
ses separated by spaces>

     * To check the status of a gateway service on a particular node:
       Run the command [5]maprcli service list on the clusters where the
       gateways are running.

Running the maprcli cluster gateway set command

   The syntax of the [6]maprcli cluster gateway set command is:
maprcli cluster gateway set -dstcluster <cluster name> -gateways "<space-delimit
ed list of gateways>"

   To generate a list of the existing gateways in a MapR cluster, use the
   [7]maprcli cluster gateway list command. You can then copy this list
   and paste it into the maprcli cluster gateway set command.
   Alternatively, to generate a list of the gateways on a local cluster,
   run the [8]maprcli cluster gateway local -format text command. If you
   want to run the command from a different cluster and point to the
   cluster where the gateways are located, use -cluster parameter can be
   used to provide the name of that cluster.

   For example, suppose that you are configuring table replication from
   the cluster sanfrancisco to the cluster newyork and want to use two
   gateways. The nodes on which these gateways are located are named gw1
   and gw2.

   The command that you run will look like this:
maprcli cluster gateway set -dstcluster newyork -gateways "gw1.bigcompany.com gw
2.bigcompany.com"

Adding a DNS record to your DNS server's zone file for your domain

   In your DNS serverâ€™s zone file for your domain, add a record for the
   cluster where gateways are located, listing the nodes to use as
   gateways. You can use the MapR Control System (MCS) to create a record
   that you can copy into a DNS configuration file, run a maprcli command
   to generate the record, or create a record manually.

   To create a record with the MCS, follow these steps:
    1. Log into MCS on the cluster where the gateways are located.
    2. In the Navigation pane, select MapR-DB Tables.
    3. In the MapR-DB Tables section, click the button Generate Gateway
       DNS. A window opens with the generated DNS entry.
    4. Copy and paste the record into your zone file.

   To generate a record by using the maprcli, follow these steps:
    1. On the cluster where the gateways are located, run the command
       maprcli cluster gateway local -format dns. If you want to run the
       command from a different cluster and point to the cluster that
       hosts the gateways, use the -cluster parameter to provide the name
       of the latter cluster.
    2. Copy and paste the output of this command into your zone file.

   If you want to create a record manually, use the following format:
gateway.<clustername> IN TXT "<space-delimited list of hostnames>"

   You can also specify IP addresses, though using hostnames is
   recommended so that it is easier to locate gateways if their IP
   addresses change. Combinations of hostnames and IP addresses are also
   supported. The default port is 7660. If a gateway is using a different
   port, append a colon to the address and then specify the port number.
   Here is an example entry:
gateway.newyork.bigcompany.com gw1ny.bigcompany.com gw2ny.bigcompany.com

   Multi-homing is also supported. Simply separate the entries for a
   single node with semicolons, as in this example that uses IP addresses:
gateway.newyork.bigcompany.com 10.10.34.20 10.10.34.22 10.10.34.24;173.194.79.12

If a Gateway Fails

   If a gateway fails, the warden service tries three (3) times to restart
   it automatically. After an interval, the warden tries again three times
   to start the gateway. You can configure the interval by using the
   parameter services.retryinterval.time.sec in the warden.conf file. The
   default is 30 minutes.

   During the time that the gateway is down, source clusters will resend
   updates to other gateways. Source clusters will also ping the failed
   gateway with an exponentially increasing backoff.

   If all of the gateways fail in a destination cluster, source clusters
   will ping the failed gateways in the same manner. Updates pending
   replication are stored on disk in an internal data structure until at
   least one gateway in the destination cluster comes back online.
   Therefore, you will see additional storage costs during a gateway
   outage. The Gateway Service Down alarm in MCS will notify you when none
   of the gateways in a destination cluster can be reached.

   If the additional storage becomes too costly, you can follow either of
   these procedures:

   If you are replicating to a MapR-DB binary table:
    1. Run the [9]maprcli table replica remove command to stop replicating
       to the replica. This action deletes the pending updates.
    2. Resolve the gateway outage.
    3. Recreate the replica and start replicating to it by running the
       [10]maprcli table replica autosetup command.

   If you are replicating to a MapR-ES stream:
    1. Run the maprcli stream replica remove command to stop replicating
       to the replica stream. This action cancels the pending updates to
       the replica stream.
    2. Resolve the gateway outage.
    3. Run the command maprcli stream replica autosetup to recreate the
       replica stream and start replicating to it.

Troubleshooting

   You can refer to two log files for each gateway when troubleshooting.
   Both are in the /opt/mapr/logs directory on the node where the gateway
   is running:
     * gateway.log
     * gatewayinit.log

MapR-DB Lookup Order

   MapR-DB uses the following order to locate the gateways that are
   running in a destination cluster.
     * Look up the destination cluster's name and gateway addresses in the
       information specified by the [11]maprcli cluster gateway set
       command. If a list of gateways, then a DNS lookup is performed.
     * Perform a DNS lookup of the destination cluster and the addresses
       of the gateways. If no DNS record for the destination cluster is
       found, then the lookup goes to the mapr-clusters.conf file.
     * Look up the destination cluster's name and the CLDB node addresses
       in the mapr-clusters.conf file under the assumption that gateways
       are running on all of the CLDB nodes and only on those nodes.
