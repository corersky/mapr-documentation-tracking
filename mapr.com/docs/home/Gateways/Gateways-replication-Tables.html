Gateways for Replicating MapR-DB Tables

   In MapR-DB table replication, MapR-DB replicates updates to tables
   (binary and JSON) on source MapR clusters to replicas of those tables
   on destination MapR clusters. Gateways are services that receive these
   updates and apply them to the replicas. These gateways also propagate
   updates from JSON tables to their secondary indexes.
   To set up gateways for replicating MapR-DB tables:
     * On the nodes of destination clusters, install the gateways.
       You must install gateways in the destination clusters.
          + If the destination cluster is remote from the source cluster,
            then the gateways must be in the remote cluster.
          + If the destination cluster is the source cluster, meaning that
            a source table and its replica are located in a single
            cluster, then the gateways must be in the local cluster.
          + If you have secondary indexes on your MapR-DB JSON tables,
            then the gateways must be in the local cluster.
     * On the source clusters, configure the gateways by listing the
       destination cluster and the gateways that are running on them.

How Replication Works

   During replication, MapR-DB sends source table updates to the gateways
   on the destination clusters where the replicas of those source tables
   are located. Gateways batch the updates and then apply them to
   replicas.

   All updates from a source table arrive at a replica after having been
   authenticated at a gateway. Therefore, access control expressions on
   the replica that control permissions for updates to column families and
   columns are irrelevant; gateways have the implicit authority to update
   replicas.

   MapR-DB distributes updates to a destination clusterâ€™s gateways in
   round-robin fashion. If a gateway is down or unreachable, MapR-DB
   chooses another gateway or retries the operation on the same gateway.
   Note: If a table is replicated to another table, using the replication
   gateway, and you run a truncate operation on the source table, this
   operation is not replicated.

Gateways on nodes in remote destination MapR clusters

   In this type of topology, gateways receive updates that are made to
   source tables, authenticate with the destination cluster on behalf of
   the source cluster, and apply the updates to the corresponding
   replicas.

   This schematic diagram of basic intercluster master-slave replication
   shows updates to the customers table in the cluster sanfrancisco being
   sent to gateways. The gateways then apply the updates to the replica
   that is in the cluster newyork.

   The gateways on a destination cluster are not assigned to particular
   replicas. They apply updates to all replicas on the destination
   cluster. For example, in this diagram updates to two source tables in
   the cluster sanfrancisco are being replicated to two replicas in the
   cluster newyork. There are four gateways. Each gateway receives updates
   to both source tables, and each gateway applies those updates to both
   replicas.

Gateways on nodes within a MapR cluster serving as source and destination

   In this type of topology, gateways again receive updates that are made
   to source tables and apply the updates to the replicas. However, all of
   this activity takes place within a single MapR cluster.

   This schematic diagram of basic intracluster master-slave replication
   shows updates to the customersA table in the cluster sanfrancisco being
   sent to gateways. The gateways then apply the updates to the table
   customersB.
