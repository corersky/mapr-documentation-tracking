Gateways and Stream Replication

   When replicating streams, MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka replicates
   messages that are published to a source stream. Gateways are services
   that receive messages from source streams and publish them in replica
   streams.

   You configure gateways on nodes that are in destination clusters. On
   source clusters, you list the destination clusters and the gateways
   that are running on them.
   For information on configuring and managing gateways, see:
     * [1]Configuring Gateways for Table and Stream Replication
     * [2]Managing Gateways

   During replication, MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka sends messages
   from source streams to the gateways on the destination clusters, where
   the replicas of those source streams are located. Gateways batch the
   messages and then apply them to replicas. All messages from a source
   stream arrive at a replica after having been authenticated at a
   gateway. Therefore, access control expressions on the replica that
   control permission to publish messages are irrelevant; gateways have
   the implicit authority to publish messages to replicas.

   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka distributes messages to a destination
   clusterâ€™s gateways in round-robin fashion. If a gateway is down or
   unreachable, MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka chooses another gateway.
   If all of the gateways are down, MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka
   retries the operation periodically until a gateway comes online.

   You must configure gateways in destination clusters. If the destination
   cluster is remote from the cluster in which a source stream is located,
   then the gateways must be in the remote cluster. If the destination
   cluster is the source cluster, meaning that a source stream and its
   replica are located in a single cluster, then the gateways must be in
   the local cluster.

   For more information about replicating streams, see [3]Stream
   Replication.

Gateways on nodes in remote destination MapR clusters

   In this type of topology, gateways receive messages that are published
   to source streams, authenticate with the destination cluster on behalf
   of the source cluster, and publish the messages to the corresponding
   streams.

   This diagram of basic intercluster master-slave replication shows
   messages from the activity stream in the cluster sanfrancisco being
   sent to gateways. The gateways then publish the messages to the replica
   stream that is in the cluster newyork.

   The gateways on a destination cluster are not assigned to particular
   replicas. They publish messages to all replicas on the destination
   cluster. For example, in this diagram messages from two source streams
   in the cluster sanfrancisco are being replicated to two replicas in the
   cluster newyork. There are four gateways. Each gateway receives
   messages from both source streams, and each gateway applies those
   messages to the corresponding replicas.

Gateways on nodes within a MapR cluster serving as source and destination

   In this type of topology, gateways again receive messages that are
   published to source streams and publish the streams to the replicas.
   However, all of this activity takes place within a single MapR cluster.

   This schematic diagram of basic intracluster master-slave replication
   shows messages from the activity1 stream in the cluster sanfrancisco
   being sent to gateways. The gateways then publish the messages to the
   stream activity2.
