Installing and Uninstalling the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI)
Storage Plugin

   This section describes the steps for installing or uninstalling the
   MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin.

Installing the CSI Driver

    1. [1]Download and install the CSI Driver custom resource definition
       on the Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:
kubectl create -f csi-maprkdf-v1.0.0.yaml
       When you run the command to install the CSI Driver, the service
       accounts, rule-based access controls (RBAC), and the statefulset
       and daemonset are created on the pods on the Kubernetes cluster.
    2. Verify the installation by running the following command.
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide

   After installing, you can use the CSI Driver to statically and
   dynamically provision and mount a MapR volume. See [2]Using the MapR
   Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin for more information.

Uninstalling the CSI Driver

   To uninstall the CSI driver, run the following command:
kubectl delete -f csi-maprkdf-v1.0.0.yaml

   When you run the command to uninstall, all the pods with the mount
   provisioned by CSI Driver are removed.
