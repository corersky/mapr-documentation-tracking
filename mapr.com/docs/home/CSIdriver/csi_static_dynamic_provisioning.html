Static and Dynamic Volume Provisioning Using MapR Container Storage Interface
(CSI) Storage Plugin

   Kubernetes makes a distinction between static and dynamic provisioning
   of storage.
     * [1]Static Provisioning
     * [2]Dynamic Provisioning

   In static provisioning, a MapR administrator first creates MapR volumes
   (mount points) and then ensures that they are mounted, and a Kubernetes
   administrator exposes those MapR mount points in Kubernetes through
   Kubernetes PersistentVolumes. In a typical static-provisioning
   scenario, a Pod author requests that a Kubernetes admin create a
   PersistentVolume that references an existing MapR mount point with a
   dataset that the Pod author is interested in. This PersistentVolume
   references the CSI driver. The CSI Driver mounts and unmounts MapR
   mount points for the requesting Pod. In addition, CSI supports the
   creation of a PersistentVolume directly by creating a
   PersistentVolumeClaim. The Pod author requests that a Kubernetes admin
   to create a PersistentVolume that points to the CSI driver and
   references an existing MapR mount point.

   In dynamic provisioning, a Kubernetes administrator creates a set of
   StorageClasses pointing to the CSI provisioner for MapR Data Fabric.
   Each StorageClass has a predefined set of storage characteristics.
   Examples of these characteristics include the CLDB hosts, REST server
   hosts, provisioner secret name and namespace, MapR volume name prefix,
   MapR volume mount path, and volume advisory quota size. The Pod creator
   searches the predefined Storage Classes for the one that best matches
   the creatorâ€™s requirements. When the Pod references this StorageClass
   through a PersistentVolumeClaim, the StorageClass calls the CSI
   Provisioner for MapR Data Fabric to allocate storage for the requesting
   Pod dynamically and creates the volume.

   To leverage MapR Filesystem with a Kubernetes cluster, you can create a
   PersistentVolume in Kubernetes. This diagram shows the two ways in
   which the PersistentVolume can be provisioned:

   To accomplish static provisioning, the CSI Driver for MapR Data Fabric
   for Kubernetes is deployed to all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster via a
   Kubernetes [5]DaemonSet. The CSI Driver uses the Basic, which is the
   default, or the optional Platinum [6]POSIX client to mount the MapR
   file system. The information that the POSIX client uses to connect to
   MapR is contained in a Kubernetes Volume or PersistentVolume. A MapR
   ticket inside a Secret, referenced by the Kubernetes Volume or
   PersistentVolume spec, is used by the POSIX client to pass secure data
   to the filesystem.

   To accomplish dynamic provisioning, the CSI provisioner is deployed as
   a StatefulSet in the Kubernetes cluster.

   A Kubernetes Administrator must configure at least one storage class
   with MapR parameters (for example, mirroring, snapshots, quotas, and
   other parameters) for use during creation of the MapR volume. The
   storage class passes MapR administrative credentials to the provisioner
   through a Kubernetes Secret. Security for the provisioner is handled
   through role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.
