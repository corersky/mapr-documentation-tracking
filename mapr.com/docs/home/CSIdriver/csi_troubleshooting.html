Troubleshooting the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin

   This section describes how to resolve common problems you might
   encounter when installing and using the MapR Container Storage
   Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin.

Troubleshooting CSI Driver installation

   Run the following command to get the Pods deployed for CSI plugin and
   provisioner:
kubectl get pods -n mapr-csi

   The installation is considered successful if the above command shows
   the Pods in "Running" state. For example, your output should look
   similar to the following when CSI plugin is deployed on 3 Worker nodes:
mapr-csi       csi-controller-kdf-0         5/5     Running     0          4h25m
mapr-csi       csi-nodeplugin-kdf-2kfrf     3/3     Running     0          4h25m
mapr-csi       csi-nodeplugin-kdf-lq5nw     3/3     Running     0          4h25m
mapr-csi       csi-nodeplugin-kdf-pkrzt     3/3     Running     0          4h25m

   The above output shows the following:
     * csi-nodeplugin-kdf-*: Daemonset pods deployed on all the kubernetes
       worker nodes
     * csi-controller-kdf-0: StatefulSet Pod deployed on a single
       kubernetes worker node

Troubleshoot MapR CSI plugin Deployment failures

   If the pods shows failure in the deployment, run the following kubectl
   command to see the container logs:
kubectl logs <csi-nodeplugin-*> -n mapr-csi -c <Nodeplugin-Pod-container>

   Here, replace <Nodeplugin-Pod-container> with the container which is
   failing. You can also run the following kubectl command to see the
   controller logs:
kubectl logs csi-controller-kdf-0 -n mapr-csi -c <Controller-Pod-Container>

   Here, replace <Controller-Pod-Container> with the container which is
   failing.

Troubleshooting a volume provisioning

   See the provisioner log and check for any provisioner errors:
tail -100f /var/log/csi-maprkdf/csi-provisioner-1.0.0.log

Troubleshooting mount operation

   see the CSI Storage plug-in log and check for any mount/unmount errors:
tail -100f /var/log/csi-maprkdf/csi-plugin-1.0.0.log

   If you donâ€™t see any errors, see the kubelet logs on the node where the
   pod is scheduled to run. Check for the MapR CSI Storage plugin logs for
   specific errors.

Troubleshooting MapR CSI Storage Plugin discovery with kubelet

   Check the kubelet path for kubernetes deployment from the kubelet
   process running with --root-dir. The --root-dir is a string that
   contains the directory path for managing kubelet files (such as volume
   mounts, etc.,) and defaults to /var/lib/kubelet. If the kubernetes
   environment has a different kubelet path, modify the CSI driver
   deployment .yaml file with the new path and redeploy the MapR CSI
   Storage Plugin again.

Troubleshooting snapshot provisioning

   See the provisioner log and check for any provisioner errors:
tail -100f /var/log/csi-maprkdf/csi-provisioner-1.0.0.log

   If there are no errors, run the following kubectl command to check the
   snapshot:
kubectl describe volumesnapshot.snapshot.storage.k8s.io <snapshot-name> -n <name
space-name>

   Here:
     * <snapshot-name>: Name of the VolumeSnapshot Object defined in yaml
     * <namespace-name>: Namespace where the VolumeSnapshot object is
       created

Troubleshooting no space on disk error

   The devicemapper storage driver used for Docker allows only 10GB by
   default resulting in "no space left on device" errors when writing to
   new directories for a new volume mount request. If --maxvolumepernode
   is configured to be greater than 20 and underlying docker is using
   devicemapper storagedriver, do the following to increase the storage
   size:
    1. Change storagedriver to be other than devicemapper, which restricts
       container storage to 10GB by default.
    2. Increase default container storage to more than the default of 10GB
       for devicemapper storagedriver for the Docker container running on
       Kubernetes worker node.

   For example, do the following to increase the storage size to 50GB:
    1. In /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage file, add --storage-opt
       dm.basesize=50G under DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS section.
    2. Restart Docker.
    3. Confirm that the setting is correctly applied by running the
       following command:
docker info | grep "Base Device Size"
