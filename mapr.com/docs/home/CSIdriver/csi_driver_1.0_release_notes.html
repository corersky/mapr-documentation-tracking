   * Kubernetes alpha features are not supported.

New in this Release

   This first release of the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI)
   Storage Plugin includes .yaml configuration files that can be installed
   onto a Kubernetes cluster. Once installed, these containers provide a
   CSI Driver for MapR Filesystem volume plug-in and a Kubernetes Dynamic
   Volume Provisioner that permit static and dynamic provisioning of MapR
   storage from Kubernetes.

Patches

   None.

Limitations

   Note the following limitations:
     * CSI Driver version 1.0 does not support coexistence with FlexVolume
       Driver on the same Kubernetes cluster.
     * All nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must use the same Linux OS.
       Configuration files are available to support these Linux
       distributions:
          + CentOS
          + Red Hat (use CentOS configuration file)
          + Ubuntu
     * The Basic POSIX client package is included by default when you
       install the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin.
       The Platinum POSIX client can be enabled by specifying a parameter
       in the Pod spec. Only the FUSE-based POSIX client is supported.
       NFSv3 and NFSv4 are not supported.
     * The CSI Driver does not include support for inline volumes in pods.
       It only supports PersistentVolumes.

Known Issues

   Note the following known issues:
     * On nodeplugin Pod restart or upgrade scenario, the existing POSIX
       client(s) running in the CSI Driver container are killed. The
       workaround is to move/stop the container workload using MapR CSI
       Storage Plugin, restart/update the MapR CSI Storage Plugin and
       start using the MapR CSI Storage Plugin again.
     * On Provisioner restart, Provisioner loses the information about the
       REST server where volume or snapshot should be deleted for existing
       volume and snapshots provisioned. The administrator must manually
       remove the volume and/or snapshot for provisioned volumes from the
       MapR Data Platform.
     * Provisioned snapshot information is written to the provisioner log,
       but not available in the Kubernetes objects such as
       volumeSnapshots, VolumesnapshotContents etc.
     * If you want read-only behavior, specify readOnly in the
       volumeAttributes. For example, the following is supported:
csi:
    nodePublishSecretRef:
      name: "mapr-ticket-secret"
      namespace: "test-csi"
    driver: com.mapr.csi-kdf
    volumeHandle: pv-securepv-test-read-only-id
    volumeAttributes:
      volumePath: "/user/root"
      cluster: "clusterA"
      cldbHosts: "10.10.10.210"
      securityType: "secure"
      readOnly: "true"
       The following is not supported:
csi:
    nodePublishSecretRef:
      name: "mapr-ticket-secret"
      namespace: "test-csi"
    driver: com.mapr.csi-kdf
    volumeHandle: pv-securepv-test-read-only-id
    readOnly: true
    volumeAttributes:
      volumePath: "/user/root"
      cluster: "clusterA"
      cldbHosts: "10.10.10.210"
      securityType: "secure"

Resolved Issues

   None.
