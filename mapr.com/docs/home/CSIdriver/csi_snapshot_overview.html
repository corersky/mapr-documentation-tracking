Managing Snapshots Using the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage
Plugin

   This section describes how to create and delete one or more snapshots
   of volumes dynamically provisioned by the MapR Container Storage
   Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin on the MapR cluster.

   The MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin v1.0.0 uses
   the csi-snapshotter to support snapshot provisioning. Snapshot restore,
   which allows you to restore the volume to a previous state with the
   snapshot data, is not suported.
