Example: Mounting a PersistentVolume for Static Provisioning Using MapR
Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin

   For static provisioning, configuring a PersistentVolume has some
   advantages over annotating Kubernetes volume information in a Pod spec:
     * The configuration file can be shared for use by multiple Pod specs.
     * The configuration file enables the PersistentVolume to be mounted
       and available even when the Pod spec that references it is removed.

   For example, suppose a marketing volume exists in the secure MapR
   filesystem under the path /Departments/Marketing. An administrator
   wants to statically provision this volume and make it available to
   multiple users. It is critical that data access is as fast as possible.
   To make this work, the administrator must do the following:
    1. Create a PersistentVolume (PV) (if you have already not statically
       provisioned a MapR volume as described in this [1]example) and set
       the following volumeAttributes:
          + accessMode of the PV to ReadWriteOnce
          + securityType parameter to secure because the volume is on a
            secure MapR cluster
          + volumePath in the CSI driver setting to the desired path, and
            fill in the cldbHosts and cluster information
          + platinum parameter to use the POSIX platinum client
       For example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: test-simplepv
  namespace: test-csi
  labels:
    name: pv-simplepv-test
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  csi:
    nodePublishSecretRef:
      name: "mapr-ticket-secret"
      namespace: "test-csi"
    driver: com.mapr.csi-kdf
    volumeHandle: test-simplepv
    volumeAttributes:
      volumePath: "/"
      cluster: "clusterA"
      cldbHosts: "10.10.102.96"
      securityType: "secure"
      platinum: "true"
       The following table shows the properties defined in the sample
       PersistentVolume:

   Parameter Notes
   metadata: name The PersistentVolume name.
   metadata: namespace The namespace in which the PersistentVolume is
   stored.
   accessModes How the PersistentVolume is mounted on the host. All modes
   work the same. The example uses ReadWriteOnce. Note that ReadOnlyMany
   does not mount read-only.

   Note: The accessMode is not used to set the access mode bit on the
   volume. The accessMode of the PV and PVC should be the same so that
   they can bind.
   For more information, see [2]Access Modes.
   persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy Specifies what happens to the volume when
   it is released by its claim. The Retain value keeps the PVC around for
   manual cleanup. Delete deletes the PV from Kubernetes.

   Note: If this volume was created using dynamic provisioning, Delete
   causes the underlying volume to be deleted.
   For more information, see [3]Reclaiming.
   Capacity Specifies how big the allocated storage should be. This value
   is not validated against the MapR quota or advisory quota. It is up to
   the person creating the PV to specify this value accurately.
   csi: nodePublishSecretRef The Ticket Secret for the CSI driver.
   nodePublishSecretRef:name The name of the Ticket Secret that contains
   the ticket to use when mounting to the MapR cluster. See [4]Configuring
   a Secret.
   nodePublishSecretRef:namespace The namespace that contains the Ticket
   Secret. Use the same namespace as the namespace used by the
   PersistentVolume.
   csi: driver The MapR CSI driver being used. Call it by specifying
   driver: mapr.com/maprfs.
   volumePath The mount point within the MapR filesystem. This parameter
   specifies an existing MapR path. For example, you can specify the root
   volume as "/", providing access to the entire filesystem.
   cluster The MapR cluster name.
   cldbHosts The hostname or IP addresses of the CLDB hosts for the MapR
   cluster. You must provide at least one CLDB host. For fault-tolerance,
   providing multiple CLDB hosts is recommended. To specify multiple
   hosts, separate each name or IP address by a space.
   securityType A parameter that indicates whether MapR tickets are used
   or not used. If MapR tickets are used, specify secure. Otherwise,
   specify unsecure.
   platinum If set to platinum: "true", the POSIX client uses the platinum
   driver for better performance. Note that the platinum driver consumes
   more host resources and MapR Platinum licenses.
       See [5]Example: Statically Provisioning a MapR Volume Using MapR
       Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin for more
       information.
    2. Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) spec and set the accessMode of
       the PVC to ReadWriteOnce.
       For example:
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: test-simplepvc
  namespace: test-csi
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5G
       The following table shows the properties used in the sample
       PersistentVolumeClaim:

   Parameter Notes
   metadata: name The PersistentVolumeClaim name.
   metadata: namespace The namespace in which the PersistentVolumeClaim is
   configured.
   accessMode How the requested PersistentVolume is mounted on the host.
   All modes work the same. The example uses ReadWriteOnce. Note that
   ReadOnlyMany does not mount read-only.

   Note: The PV and PVC modes should be the same so that they can bind.
   For more information, see [6]Access Modes.
    3. Generate a MapR service ticket and create and deploy a ticket
       secret on the Pod (if you have already not done it as described in
       steps 1 and 2 of this [7]example).
       See [8]maprlogin for information on generating a ticket and
       [9]Configuring a Secret for information on creating and deploying a
       ticket secret.
    4. Create the Pod spec and set the runAsUser and the fsGroup
       parameters to the UID and GID of the user that created the ticket.
       For example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pv
  namespace: test-csi
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    args:
    - sleep
    - "1000000"
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "2Gi"
        cpu: "500m"
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /mapr
      name: maprflex
  volumes:
    - name: maprflex
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: test-simplepvc
       The following table shows the properties defined in the sample Pod
       spec:

   Parameter Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version for the Pod spec.
   kind The kind of object being created. The example uses a naked Pod for
   clarity. Generally, it is better to use a Deployment, DaemonSet, or
   StatefulSet for high availability and ease of upgrade.
   metadata: name The Pod name.
   metadata: namespace The namespace in which the Pod runs.
   securityContext: runAsUser The user ID to run the container under. This
   user ID must be the same as the user ID for which the ticket was
   generated.
   securityContext: fsGroup The group ID to run the container under. This
   group ID must be the same as the group ID of the user for which the
   ticket was generated.
   volumeMounts: mountPath A directory inside the container that is
   designated as the mount path.
   volumeMounts: name A name that you assign to the Kubernetes
   volumeMounts resource. Matches with Volumes: name.
   Volumes: name A string to identify the name of the Kubernetes volumes
   resource. The value should match volumeMounts: name.
   persistentVolumeClaim: claimName The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim
   (PVC). For more information, see [10]PersistentVolumeClaims.
    5. Deploy the .yaml file on the Pod by running the following command:
kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml
       For each Pod mount request, the POSIX client starts with the Pod's
       hostname and new generated hostid, which is tracked on the MapR
       cluster. You can run the [11]node list command on the MapR cluster
       to determine the number of POSIX clients. For example:
# maprcli node list -clientsonly true
clienttype clienthealth hostname ip lasthb id
