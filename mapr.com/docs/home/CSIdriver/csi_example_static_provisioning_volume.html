Example: Statically Provisioning a MapR Volume Using MapR Container Storage
Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin

   You can designate a MapR volume for use with Kubernetes by specifying
   the MapR volume parameters directly inside the PersistentVolume spec.

   Suppose a developer who wants to get an application container up and
   running quickly with MapR. The developer already has a MapR path that
   the developer wants to use for the application. The developer only
   needs the data accessible to read. To make this work, the developer
   must do the following:
    1. Generate a MapR service ticket and set the securityType parameter
       in the PersistentVolume spec to secure if the MapR volume to mount
       is on a secure MapR cluster.
       See [1]Generating a Service Ticket for more information. For
       example:
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-securepv-test
  namespace: test-csi
  labels:
    name: pv-securepv-test
  spec:
    accessModes:
    …
    csi:
      …
      volumeAttributes:
        …
        securityType: "secure"
    2. Configure a Ticket Secret and include the base64-encoded contents
       of the ticket file in the Ticket Secret if the MapR volume to mount
       is on a secure MapR cluster.
       See [2]Configuring a Secret for more information. The following
       table describes the properties in the Secret file:

   Property Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version.
   kind The type of object being created.
   name A string to identify the Secret.
   namespace The namespace in which the Secret runs.
   type The type of Secret being created. For type Opaque, clients must
   treat these values as opaque and pass them unmodified back to the
   server.
   CONTAINER_TICKET The contents of the MapR ticket encoded in base64. If
   you specified secure for the securityType, you must provide the ticket.
   To encode the ticket, see [3]Converting a String to Base64. You may
   remove the ticket if the MapR cluster is not secure.
    3. Set the runAsUser and the fsGroup parameters in the Pod spec to the
       UID and GID of the user that created the ticket.
       For example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pv1
  namespace: test-csi
spec:
  ...
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup:2000
  ...
       The following table lists the properties specified in the sample
       Pod spec:

   Parameter Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version for the Pod spec.
   kind The kind of object being created. For clarity, the example uses a
   naked Pod. Generally, it is better to use a Deployment, DaemonSet, or
   StatefulSet for high availability (HA) and ease of upgrade.
   metadata: name The Pod name.
   metadata: namespace The namespace in which the Pod runs.
   securityContext: runAsUser The user ID to run the container under. This
   user ID must be the same as the user ID for which the ticket was
   generated.
   securityContext: fsGroup The group ID to run the container under. This
   group ID must be the same as the group ID of the user for which the
   ticket was generated.
    4. Point the volumePath in the CSI driver setting to the desired path,
       and fill in the cldbHosts and cluster information.
       For the complete list of MapR volume attributes, see [4]volume
       create; however, note that volume attributes like mount, quota,
       createparent, path, and name are ignored when provisioning a MapR
       volume. See [5]MapR Parameters for Static and Dynamic Provisioning
       for more information.
       For example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: test-simplepv
  namespace: test-csi
  labels:
    name: pv-simplepv-test
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  - ReadWriteMany
  - ReadOnlyMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  csi:
    driver: com.mapr.csi-kdf
    volumeHandle: test-simplepv
    volumeAttributes:
      volumePath: "/"
      cluster: "clusterA"
      cldbHosts: "10.10.10.210"
      securityType: "secure"
      platinum: "true"
       The following table lists the properties shown in the sample
       PersistentVolume spec:

   Parameter Notes
   apiVersion The Kubernetes API version for the Pod spec.
   kind The kind of object being created. For clarity, the example uses a
   naked Pod. Generally, it is better to use a Deployment, DaemonSet, or
   StatefulSet for high availability (HA) and ease of upgrade.
   metadata: name The Pod name.
   metadata: namespace The namespace in which the Pod runs.
   accessModes How the PersistentVolume is mounted on the host. All modes
   work the same.

   Note: It's important that the PV and PVC modes are the same so that
   they can bind.
   For more information, see [6]Access Modes.
   csi: driver The MapR CSI Driver being used. Call it using this driver:
   com.mapr.csi-kdf.
   volumeHandle Specifies existing volume name or unique volume name for
   static provisioning.
   volumePath The mount point within the MapR filesystem. This parameter
   specifies an existing MapR path. For example, you can specify the root
   volume as "/", providing access to the entire filesystem.
   cluster The MapR cluster name.
   cldbHosts The DNS names or IP addresses of the CLDB hosts for the MapR
   cluster. You must provide at least one CLDB host. For fault-tolerance,
   providing multiple CLDB hosts is recommended. To specify multiple
   hosts, separate each name or IP address by a space.
   securityType A parameter that indicates whether MapR tickets are used
   or not used. If MapR tickets are used, specify secure. Otherwise,
   specify unsecure.
