MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin Overview

   This page describes how the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI)
   Storage Plugin can be used to expose the MapR Data Platform to the
   containerized workload on Kubernetes.

   To install or use the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage
   Plugin, see:

About the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin

   The MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage Plugin is an
   industry standard interface that Container Orchestration systems can
   use to expose MapR Data Platform to their containerized workloads.
   Traditionally, storage vendors had to either write and support multiple
   volume drivers for different Container Orchestration systems or choose
   to not support Container Orchestration systems. Using CSI, the same
   volume driver can be used with different Container Orchestration
   systems. Also, CSI enables the volume plug-ins to be containerized to
   make it agnostic to the host underneath, which might run other software
   such as MapR, allowing both Kubernetes and MapR to co-exist on the same
   node with CSI support.
   The MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes CSI driver:
     * Allows other software to run on the same node.
     * Does not require volume plug-ins to be built into the Kubernetes
       binaries.
     * Does not require direct access to the machine to deploy volume
       plug-in.

   The CSI Driver for MapR Data Fabric for Kubernetes consists of .yaml
   configuration files for installation into Kubernetes. Once installed, a
   Kubernetes Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for MaprFS and a
   Kubernetes Dynamic Volume Provisioner are available for both static and
   dynamic provisioning of MapR storage.

   The CSI driver uses sidecar containers, which are containers included
   with the driver for handling Kubernetes events and for communicating
   with CSI drivers for storage provisioning. Specifically:
     * The csi-provisioner is used for provisioning and creating a volume
       for MapR Data Platform.
     * The csi-driver-registrar is used for registering the driver to the
       kubelet
     * The csi-attacher is used for attaching volumes to the node and
       mounting the volume
     * The livenessprobe container is used to probe the driver for health
       and readiness check
     * The csi-snapshotter is used for provisioning and creating a
       snapshot on the MapR Data Platform

   When you install the CSI driver, it creates a DaemonSet Pod for the CSI
   node service and StatefulSet Pod for CSI controller service.
