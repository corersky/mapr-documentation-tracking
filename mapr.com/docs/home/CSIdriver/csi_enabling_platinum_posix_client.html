Enabling the Platinum Posix Client for MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI)
Storage Plugin

   When you install the MapR Container Storage Interface (CSI) Storage
   Plugin, the Basic FUSE-based POSIX client package is installed on the
   CSI Driver container. The CSI Driver also supports the use of the
   Platinum FUSE-based POSIX client. For a comparison of the two POSIX
   client packages, see [1]Preparing for Installation.

   To install the Platinum POSIX client, include the platinum parameter in
   your Pod spec. For example:
options:
cluster: "cluster2"
platinum: "true"
cldbHosts: "10.10.102.96"
