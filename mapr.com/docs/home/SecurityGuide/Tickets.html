Managing Tickets

   Introduces authenticate using tickets for users and MapR servers.

   MapR implements authentication with tickets. Tickets contain keys, and
   are used to authenticate users and MapR servers. In addition,
   certificates are used to implement server authentication. Every user
   who wants to access a cluster must have a MapR user ticket
   (maprticket_<uid>) and every node in the cluster must have a MapR
   server ticket (maprserverticket).

   A ticket is an object that contains specific information about a user
   and a key. A ticket authenticates a user to the cluster. Tickets are
   encrypted to protect their contents. The following table describes the
   tickets used by MapR for internal cluster operations, the user who can
   generate the ticket, and the command used to generate the ticket. This
   type of ticket should only be placed on cluster nodes.
   Ticket Type Description Permissions/Command to Generate Ticket
   maprserver For (internal) cluster operations. This type of ticket can
   be long lasting. user root using the [1]configure.sh utility
   crosscluster For (internal) cross-cluster operations such as mirroring
   and replication. This type of ticket can be long lasting. user mapr
   using the [2]maprlogin utility. The UID of the ticket (mapr) is always
   used as the identity of the entity using this ticket.

   The following table describes the type of tickets supported by MapR for
   users and services and whether the ticket can be used to impersonate
   another user. All these tickets, except the user ticket, can only be
   generated by the cluster administrator using the [3]maprlogin utility;
   the user ticket can be generated by any valid using using the
   [4]maprlogin utility. These type of tickets can be placed on both
   cluster and client nodes and support (FUSE-based and loopbacknfs) POSIX
   clients and HDFS APIs.
   Ticket Type Description Impersonation support Notes
   user For granting access to individual users. This type of ticket has a
   short duration. N/A^* The UID of the ticket (implicit or explicit value
   of the -user parameter to maprlogin command) is used as the identity of
   the entity using this ticket, except for the exceptions noted [5]here
   for user root and user mapr.
   service For accessing services running on client nodes. This type of
   ticket can have long duration. N/A^* The UID of the ticket (explicit
   value of the -user parameter to maprlogin command) is used as the
   identity of the entity using this ticket, except for the exceptions
   noted [6]here for user root and user mapr.
   servicewithimpersonation (not scoped) For accessing services running on
   client nodes to run jobs on behalf of any user (except user mapr). This
   type of ticket can have long duration. Yes The ticket can be used to
   impersonate user root but cannot be used to impersonate user mapr.
   servicewithimpersonation (scoped) For accessing services running on
   client nodes to run jobs on behalf of the users (except user root and
   user mapr) specified in the ticket. This type of ticket can have long
   duration. Yes At ticket generation time, cannot specify UID/GID of user
   root or user mapr to impersonate user root or user mapr respectively.
   tenant For tenant user(s) to access tenant volume(s) in a multi-tenant
   environment. This type of ticket can have long duration. Yes The ticket
   can be used to impersonate user root but cannot be used to impersonate
   user mapr.
   ^* Exceptions:
     * User mapr can impersonate other users (including user root)
     * User root can impersonate other users (excluding user mapr)

   Important: The identity of the user that authenticates with the
   maprlogin utility is independent from the identity of the user of the
   client OS.

   MapR tickets contain the following information:
     * UID (generated from the UNIX user ID)
     * GIDs (group IDs for each group the user belongs to)
     * ticket creation time
     * ticket expiration time (initial duration of the ticket)
     * renewal expiration time (maximum lifetime of the ticket)
     * Whether user can (true) or cannot (false) impersonate another user

   Note that, because a ticket contains the GIDs for a user at the time
   the ticket is generated, a user must re-generate their ticket after
   changing group memberships.
