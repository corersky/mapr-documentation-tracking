Managing Tickets

   Introduces authenticate using tickets for users and MapR servers.

   MapR implements authentication with tickets. Tickets contain keys, and
   are used to authenticate users and MapR servers. In addition,
   certificates are used to implement server authentication. Every user
   who wants to access a cluster must have a MapR user ticket
   (maprticket_<uid>) and every node in the cluster must have a MapR
   server ticket (maprserverticket).

   A ticket is an object that contains specific information about a user
   and a key. A ticket authenticates a user to the cluster. Tickets are
   encrypted to protect their contents. MapR supports four types of
   tickets that can be used for authentication:
     * MapR user tickets
     * MapR service tickets
     * MapR tenant tickets
     * Kerberos tickets

   Important: The identity of the user that authenticates with the
   maprlogin utility is independent from the identity of the user of the
   client OS.

   MapR tickets contain the following information:
     * UID (generated from the UNIX user ID)
     * GIDs (group IDs for each group the user belongs to)
     * ticket creation time
     * ticket expiration time (initial duration of the ticket)
     * renewal expiration time (maximum lifetime of the ticket)
     * Whether user can (true) or cannot (false) impersonate another user

   Note that, because a ticket contains the GIDs for a user at the time
   the ticket is generated, a user must re-generate their ticket after
   changing group memberships.

   For complete syntax, see [1]The maprlogin Utility.
