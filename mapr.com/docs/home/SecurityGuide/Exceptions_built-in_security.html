Exceptions to Built-in Security in MapR

   Describes areas in which built-in security is not yet implemented for
   MapR clusters and how to work around those issues.

OpenTSDB Open for Read Access

   OpenTSDB in MapR 6.0 is not secured by default and is open for read
   access to users with network access to the cluster. Note that access is
   read-only; you cannot write to OpenTSDB. And the user interface is
   disabled.

Wire Encryption for Volumes

   By default, content in a volume is not enabled for wire encryption.
   However, when your cluster is up and running, you can enable wire
   encryption for all content in a volume when you create or modify a
   volume. To enable or disable wire encryption:
     * From the command line: Set the value for the wiresecurityenabled
       parameter to true (to enable) or false (to disable) by using the
       [1]volume create or [2]volume modify command.
     * From MCS: Use the slider to select Yes (to enable) or No (to
       disable) when [3]creating or [4]modifying a volume.
