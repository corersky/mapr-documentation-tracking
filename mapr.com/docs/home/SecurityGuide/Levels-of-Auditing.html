Levels of Auditing

   Describes how to enable auditing for file, table, and stream
   operations.

   There are two levels of auditing:
     * Auditing for cluster level operations
     * Auditing of file system, table, and stream operations

   In contrast to auditing cluster-level operations, auditing of
   filesystem, table, and stream operations needs to be enabled at
   multiple levels. For auditing file, table, and stream operations, you
   must first enable auditing at the cluster level and then enable
   auditing at the volume level. If you want:
     * Granular or selective auditing of content in the volume, you must
       also enable auditing on each individual directory, file, table,
       and/or stream in the volume, recursively from the root directory,
       using the hadoop command. If auditing is enabled at the root
       directory, all new files inherit the property.
     * To audit all content (files, tables, and/or streams) in the volume,
       you can set the forceaudit parameter at the volume level,
       irrespective of what is set (or whether or not auditing is enabled)
       at the individual file, table, and/or stream level.

   The following table summarizes the requirements:

   CAPTION:

   For this type of auditing... You must enable... Using...
   Cluster-level operations Auditing at the cluster level [1]audit cluster
   command
   Granular or selective auditing of content (files, tables, and streams)
   in the volume
    1. Auditing at the cluster level
    2. Auditing at the volume level
    3. Auditing on each individual file, table, and/or stream in the
       volume, recursively from the root directory

    1. [2]audit cluster command
    2. [3]audit data, [4]volume create, or [5]volume modify command
    3. [6]hadoop mfs command

   Auditing all content (files, tables, and streams) in the volume
   (whether or not auditing is selectively enabled or disabled on the
   individual file, table, or stream)
    1. Auditing at the cluster level
    2. Auditing at the volume level

    1. [7]audit cluster command
    2. [8]audit data, [9]volume create, or [10]volume modify command

   In the following diagram, the illustration on the left shows data
   auditing enabled at three levels: the cluster level, through the
   [11]maprcli audit data command; the volume level, through any of the
   three volume commands shown in the diagram; and the level of the
   individual directory, file, table, or stream, recursively from the root
   directory, using the hadoop command. This allows you to include and/or
   exclude specific directories, files, tables, and streams for auditing.
   If auditing is not enabled at any one of these levels, operations on an
   object are not logged.

   Alternatively, after enabling auditing at the cluster level, you can
   enforce auditing for all directories, files, tables, and streams at the
   volume level itself, irrespective of audit setting at the individual
   file, table, and/or stream level, using:
     * auditenabled and forceauditenable parameters with the [12]volume
       create or [13]volume modify command.
     * enabled and forceenable parameters with the [14]volume audit
       command.

   The illustration on the right shows auditing enabled at two levels: the
   cluster level, through the [15]audit data command and the volume level
   through [16]volume audit command (enabled and forceenable parameters).
   Note: You can enable auditing at the volume level using the [17]volume
   create and [18]volume modify commands also.

   Because all levels are enabled, operations that, for example, a client
   application makes on a directory, file, table, or stream are recorded
   in an audit log.

   To give another example, in the following diagram, auditing is enabled
   at the cluster level using the [19]audit data command and at the volume
   level through the the auditenabled and forceauditenable parameters set
   using any one of the volume commands. Also note that although auditing
   is explicitly disabled at the directory, file, table, and/or stream
   level, operations on all directories, files, tables, and streams in the
   volume are audited because forceauditenable is set to true at the
   volume level.

   For granular or selective auditing, the next diagram shows auditing
   enabled at the cluster level and the volume level (with just the
   auditenabled parameter), but not on the directory, file, table, or
   stream that an operation is performed on. Although the two higher
   levels are enabled for auditing, the operation is not logged in an
   audit log because the objects on which auditing has to be performed on
   is not enabled for auditing.

   For granular or selective auditing, to give one final example, in the
   next diagram auditing is enabled on the individual directory, file,
   table, or stream and at the cluster level. However, auditing is not
   enabled at the volume level. Therefore, the operation that the client
   application performs on the object is not recorded in an audit log.
