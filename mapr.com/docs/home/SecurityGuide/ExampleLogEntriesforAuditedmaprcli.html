Viewing Log Entries for Audited maprcli Command Executions, REST API Calls,
and Actions in MCS

   Describes where audit recrods of operations performed using the CLI,
   REST API, and the MapR Control System are stored and how to view them

   The execution of any maprcli command, REST API call, or action in MCS
   on the cluster is logged in the local filesystem on the node on which
   the execution happened. The log file is
   /opt/mapr/mapr-cli-audit-log/audit.log.json. Auditing of these three
   types of operation is always enabled, whether or not auditing is
   enabled for cluster-level operations with the maprcli audit cluster
   command.

   Typical log entries provide a timestamp of the execution, the UID of
   the user who ran the command, the IP address from which the user ran
   the command, the command itself, and the status of the execution.
   Status codes are 0 for success and 1 for failure. The error messages
   field provides the reasons for failures.

   Below are some typical log entries:
