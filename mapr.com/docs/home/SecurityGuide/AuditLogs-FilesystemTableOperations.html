Viewing Audit Logs for Filesystem, Table, and Stream Operations

   Describes where MapR-FS, MapR-DB, and MapR-ES audit logs are stored and
   how to view them.

   Operations on MapR file, database, and event data are captured and
   recorded in the audit logs. The operations take place within volumes
   and have effects at the level of the MapR file system.

   These audit logs are stored in a system volume created specifically to
   store them. This volume is created automatically during cluster
   installations and upgrades. Operations are logged on the nodes on which
   the operations are executed, which could differ from the nodes where
   operations are initiated. Logs are stored in the MapR file system at
   /var/mapr/local/<node_name>/audit/. By default, only root and the mapr
   superuser can read the log files. To allow other users to read the
   logs, set ACEs on the directory granting readfile (rf), readdir (rd),
   and lookupdir (ld) permissions to the users. For example:
~# hadoop mfs -setace -R -aces "rf:u:root|u:mapr|u:m7user1,rd:u:root|u:mapr|u:m7
user1,ld:u:root|u:mapr|u:m7user1" /var/mapr/local/sample.qa.lab/audit/

   Note: For more information, see [1]Using ACEs for MapR-FS.

Audit logs for operations on directories and files

   Operations on directories and files, as well as the deletion of MapR-DB
   tables, are logged in files that have this naming convention:
   FSAudit.log.json-dd-mm-yyyy-<001-999>

   To see what information is recorded in typical log entries, see
   [2]Example Log Entries for Audited Filesystem Operations.

Audit logs for operations on MapR-DB tables and MapR streams

   All operations on MapR-DB tables and MapR streams are logged in files
   that have this naming convention: DBAudit.log.json-dd-mm-yyy-<001-999>

   Operations that result from maprcli commands, REST calls, or activity
   in the MapR Control Service are also logged in
   /opt/mapr/mapr-cli-audit-log/audit.log.json in the local filesystem on
   the nodes where the operations are processed.

   To see what information is recorded in typical log entries, see
   [3]Example Log Entries for Audited Operations on MapR-DB Tables.
   Note: Due to the way that the creation of tables is processed
   internally, sometimes the creation of tables is logged in
   FSAudit.log.json, rather than in DBAudit.log.json.
