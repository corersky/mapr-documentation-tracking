Resolving Username with UID and GIDs During Impersonation

   Lists configuration parameters necessary to configure impersonation.

   To resolve username with UID and GIDs on the server (and not the local
   operating system registry) during impersonation, you can set the
   following configuration parameters on the client and CLDB.

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Description
   fs.mapr.server.resolve.user Must be set in core-site.xml file on the
   client machine. Value can be one of the following:
     * true - enable
     * false - disable

   By default, this is disabled. If enabled, client will request CLDB to
   resolve user with UID/GIDs. For example, to enable this property, your
   entry in core-site.xml file should be as shown below:
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>fs.mapr.server.resolve.user</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
</configuration>

   cldb.security.resolve.user Must be set using the config command. Value
   can be one of the following:
     * 0 - disable
     * 1 - enable

   By default, this is disabled. If enabled, CLDB will resolve the user
   with UID/GIDs for all incoming client requests. For example, to enable
   this property, run the following command:
maprcli config save -values {cldb.security.resolve.user:1}

   Note: Both the configuration parameters must be set to enable support
   for UID/GID resolution on the server. If the configuration parameter is
   set on the client to resolve on the server and if the configuration
   parameter is not set on CLDB, the operation will fail with an error.
