Enabling Table and Stream Authorizations with ACEs

   Permissions for MapR tables, column families, and columns are defined
   by Access Control Expressions (ACEs). You can set permissions for
   tables when you create or edit tables. You can set default permissions
   for column families when you create or edit tables, and you can
   override these defaults when you create column families.

   For the syntax to use when creating Access Control Expressions, see
   [1]ACE Syntax.

   When a user, group, or role requests to read data from, write data to,
   or append data to a column, MapR Database checks whether that user,
   group, or role has read or write permission for the column family AND
   read or write permission for the column. By default, columns allow read
   and write access to all users; in such cases, only the read or write
   permission for the column family matters.

   However, suppose that a table contains columns col1 and col2 in column
   family cf1, and these columns grant read and write permission only to
   the table creator. A different user tries to write data to these
   columns. MapR Database checks whether this user has write permission on
   cf1 AND col1 AND col2. If the user does not have all three permissions,
   MapR Database returns an error that says access for the write is
   denied.

   If this user were to try to read from the same two columns, MapR
   Database would simply not return the data. If the user tried to read
   from those two columns and additional columns on which he had read
   permissions, the results would contain the data for those additional
   columns but exclude the data for col1 and col2.
   Note: Table Permissions for Older Releases: Because MapR tables are
   stored at the file-system level, you can also set permissions for MapR
   Database tables directly in the file system, if your version of MapR
   does not support Access Control Expressions (ACEs). Support for ACEs
   was introduced in version 3.1.

   To set permissions directly in the file system, see [2]Performing
   Filesystem Operations on MapR Database Tables.

Setting Table ACEs Using the CLI

   You can set ACEs with the following commands:
     * [3]table create — Creates a new MapR table.
     * [4]table edit — Edits a MapR table.
     * [5]table cf create — Creates a column family for a MapR table.
     * [6]table cf edit — Edits a column-family definition.
     * [7]table cf colperm set — Set Access Control Expressions (ACEs) for
       a specified column.

Setting Stream ACEs Using the CLI

   You can set ACEs with the following commands:
     * [8]stream create — Creates a new MapR stream.
     * [9]stream edit — Edits a MapR stream.
