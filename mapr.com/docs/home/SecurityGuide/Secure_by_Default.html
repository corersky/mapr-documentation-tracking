Security for Ecosystem Components

   Whether you install MapR software by using the MapR Installer or by
   using manual steps, the platform and its ecosystem components are
   installed with security ON by default.

MapR Installer: Security with a Single Click

   A single option in the [1]MapR Installer controls security for the
   platform and ecosystem components. The [2]Enable MapR Secure Cluster
   option is checked by default for new installations.

   To disable security, you can deselect Enable MapR Secure Cluster before
   starting the installation using the MapR Installer. If you need to add
   security later, you can do so by selecting the option during an
   Incremental Install operation.
   Note: Note that some [3]exceptions to secure by default can require
   manual intervention. Also, before enabling security using the
   Incremental Install function, be sure to review the known issue
   (IN-1084) related to custom certificates. See [4]MapR Installer Known
   Issues.

Manual Installation: Security with configure.sh

   When you install a MapR cluster using the [5]manual steps, you
   configure security on all nodes by using the configure.sh script with
   the -secure -genkeys [6]options, as described in [7]Enabling Security.

   Manual installation also creates a cluster that is secure by default.
   For individual ecosystem components, additional security measures are
   supported, depending on the component. See the notes in the following
   table.

Security and Ecosystem Components

   The MapR platform and the majority of ecosystem components are
   installed to be secure by default (with some exceptions). The following
   table lists the MEP 6.0.0 ecosystem components that are secure by
   default when installed using the MapR Installer or manual installation
   steps.
   Component Supports Secure by Default Notes

   the MapR Data Access Gateway.
   Drill Yes For more information about Drill security, see [9]Securing
   Drill.
   Flume No Flume is installed as a library but works like a service after
   the agents are started. To configure security for Flume, see
   [10]Configuring Flume. [11]Security Exceptions notes a security
   exception for Avro clients.

   Secure Cluster Option and [24]Using the Enable MapR DARE Option.
   Myriad N/A This component can be configured to run on a secure MapR
   cluster.
   Oozie Yes For more information, see [25]Configuring Oozie on a Secure
   Cluster.

   S3server Yes For more information, See [26]Understanding the MapR
   Object Store Authorization Model.
   Sentry No This component can be configured to run on a secure MapR
   cluster. Security must be configured manually.
