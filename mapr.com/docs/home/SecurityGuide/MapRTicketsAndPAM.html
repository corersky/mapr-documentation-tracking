Configuring MapR PAM Authenticator

   The MapR Converged Data Platform supports [1]Pluggable Authentication
   Modules (PAM) in the UNIX authentication stack. MapR provides a PAM
   Authenticator module that generates MapR tickets in conjunction with
   the maprlogin utility. After you install the MapR Converged Data
   Platform, the PAM Authenticator module is located at
   $INSTALL_DIR/lib/libmapr_pam.so. Configuration files for PAM are
   located in the /etc/pam.d directory, and each UNIX operation, such as
   su, login, or ssh, has a specific PAM configuration file in that
   directory.

Configure the PAM Authenticator on Ubuntu or SUSE

   To configure the MapR PAM Authenticator, append the following line to
   the end of the /etc/pam.d/common-auth file:

   auth optional /opt/mapr/lib/libmapr_pam.so # MapR PAM module
   Warning: An absolute path to the location of the libmapr_pam.so file is
   required. By default, this location is $MAPR_HOME/lib/libmapr_pam.so.

Configure the PAM Authenticator on Red Hat or CentOS

    1. Insert the following line in the /etc/pam.d/system-auth file
       immediately before the first module that uses the auth sufficient
       configuration:
auth optional libmapr_pam.so # MapR PAM module
    2. Append the string try_first_pass to the end of the module that uses
       auth sufficient, as in this example:
       Before modification:
auth required pam_env.so
auth sufficient pam_unix.so nullok
auth requisite pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 500 quiet
auth required pam_deny.so
       After modification, changes in bold:
auth required pam_env.so
auth optional libmapr_pam.so # MapR PAM module
auth sufficient pam_unix.so nullok try_first_pass
auth requisite pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 500 quiet
auth required pam_deny.so

Enable Debugging for PAM

   To enable debugging for the client traffic used by the maprlogin
   utility, update the /opt/mapr/conf/log4j.properties file with the
   following line:

   log4j.logger.com.mapr.login=DEBUG

   After updating the log4j.properties file, trace the com.mapr.login
   package at the DEBUG level.

   Be sure to update the correct instance of the log4j.properties file.
   Traffic specific to MapR, such as maprlogin and MapR Control System
   (MCS) traffic, uses the instance in the /opt/mapr/conf directory.
   Hadoop applications use the log4j.properties file in the
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.x.x/etc/hadoop directory.

   To perform the same tracing activity on the server side, modify the
   appropriate instance of the log4j.properties file on the server, or
   specify the page com.mapr.login in the MCS UI's tracing/logger
   settings. To trace PAM activity from the server, add the following line
   to the server's log4j.properties instance:
log4j.logger.net.sf.jpam=DEBUG

   After modifying this setting, the server log will contain a message
   similar to the following:

   2013-07-23 16:05:25,200 DEBUG Pam [1068409264@qtp-874242484-3]: Debug
   mode active.

   Detailed information about PAM activity is written to the
   /opt/mapr/logs/pam.log file.

Other Packages

   The following packages are not directly related to PAM, but can provide
   useful insights for subtler errors.
     * org.apache.hadoop.security - This package contains Apache security
       code, including MapR enhancements. Tracing this package can provide
       information about what login configuration is in use.
     * com.mapr.fs.cldb.http.login - This package contains code that the
       CLDB uses to validate maprlogin calls.

Common Issues

   The Linux Documentation Project's HOWTO on LDAP Implementation has a
   [2]section on PAM and NSS that may prove helpful.

   If a user's credentials appear valid, for example in a case where the
   su and ssh commands work normally, but PAM does not correctly
   authenticate, the issue may relate specifically to MapR's use of PAM as
   a normal user, compared to the usual case where PAM consumers run as
   the root user, causing permissions issues. The two most common issues
   relating to this condition are:
     * The /etc/shadow directory is not readable to the mapr user. This
       directory is made readable to the mapr user during install, but
       some secure environments and configuration management tools undo
       these changes.
     * A Kerberos PAM module is attempting to create and change the
       ownership of a kerberos ticket file. This attempt fails, since
       these changes require root privileges. Different Kerberos PAM
       modules can report errors differently, leading to difficulty
       tracking down root causes of errors. To address permissions
       problems with Kerberos PAM modules, configure the Kerberos PAM
       module to skip creating a ticket file, using the KDC only to
       validate the password. PAM configuration information is located in
       the /etc/pam.d directory. MapR can use a custom PAM configuration
       specified in the web.conf file.
