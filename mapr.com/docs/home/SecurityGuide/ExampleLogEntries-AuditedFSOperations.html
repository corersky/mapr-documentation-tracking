Example Log Entries for Audited Filesystem Operations

   When auditing of filesystem operations is enabled at the cluster level,
   volume level, and filesystem level, each operation on a directory or
   file is logged on the node on which the operation was initiated.

   Typical log entries provide a timestamp of the operation, the type of
   operation, the UID of the user who ran the command, the IP address from
   which the user ran the command, identifiers of the affected resources,
   the volume identifier, and the status of the operation. Status codes
   come from the Linux errno.h file. For a list of these codes, see
   [1]Status Codes That Can Appear in Audit Logs.
   Note: Due to the way that the creation of tables is processed
   internally, sometimes the creation of tables is logged in
   FSAudit.log.json, rather than in DBAudit.log.json.

   Below are some typical log entries:
{"timestamp":{"$date":"2015-06-06T10:44:22.800Z"},"operation":"MKDIR","uid":0,"i
pAddress":
"10.10.104.51","parentFid":"2049.51.131248","childFid":"2049.56.131258","childNa
me":
"ycsbTmp_1433587462796","volumeId":68048396,"status":0}
{"timestamp":{"$date":"2015-06-06T10:44:22.823Z"},"operation":"LOOKUP","uid":0,"
ipAddress":
"10.10.105.51","srcFid":"2049.56.131258","srcName":"range0","volumeId":68048396,
"status":2}
{"timestamp":{"$date":"2015-06-06T10:44:22.824Z"},"operation":"CREATE","uid":0,"
ipAddress":
"10.10.104.51","parentFid":"2049.56.131258","childFid":"2049.57.131260","childNa
me":"range0"
,"volumeId":68048396,"status":0}
{"timestamp":{"$date":"2015-06-06T10:44:22.838Z"},"operation":"WRITE","uid":0,"i
pAddress":
"10.10.105.51","srcFid":"2049.57.131260","volumeId":68048396,"status":0}
{"timestamp":{"$date":"2015-06-06T10:44:48.628Z"},"operation":"READ","uid":0,"ip
Address":
"10.10.105.51","srcFid":"2049.63.131272","volumeId":68048396,"status":0}

   To convert the user IDs to usernames, file identifiers to pathnames,
   and volume IDs to volume names, run the [2]expandaudit utility. For
   example, here are the same audit records after they were processed by
   this utility:
{"timestamp":"{$date=2015-06-06T10:44:22.800Z}","operation":"MKDIR","user":"root
