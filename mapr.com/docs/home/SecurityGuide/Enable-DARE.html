Enabling Encryption of Data at Rest

   You can enable or disable data at rest encryption at the volume level
   using the MapR Control System, CLI, and REST API if encryption of data
   at rest is enabled at the cluster level. If you installed using the
   [1]MapR Installer and selected the Enable MapR DARE option, the cluster
   is automatically enabled for data at rest encryption during
   installation. If you are upgrading or if you did not enable data at
   rest encryption at the time of installation, you can enable encryption
   of data at rest at the cluster level if the cluster is a secure
   cluster. See [2]Enabling Data at Rest Encryption at the Cluster Level
   from the Command-Line below for more information.

   If encryption is enabled at the cluster level, data at rest encryption
   is also enabled at the volume level by default through the
   mapr.volume.dare.default configuration parameter. If you do not wish to
   encrypt data at rest in a volume, you can disable encryption when you
   create a volume; you cannot modify data at rest encryption setting on a
   volume after the volume is created. See [3]Enabling or Disabling Data
   at Rest Encryption at the Volume Level Using the MapR Control System or
   [4]Enabling or Disabling Data at Rest Encryption at the Volume Level
   Using the CLI and REST API below for more information.

   Standard volumes inherit the data at rest encryption setting from a
   volume by default if the inherit property is specified. If you create a
   mirror volume for a (source) volume enabled for data at rest
   encryption, the mirror volume:
     * Inherits the data at rest encryption setting from the source volume
       if the mirror volume is in the same cluster as the source volume or
       if the mirror volume is on a remote cluster enabled for encryption
       of data at rest.
     * Does not inherit the data at rest encryption setting from the
       source volume if the mirror volume is on an unsecure cluster or if
       the mirror volume is on secure cluster that is not enabled for
       encryption of data at rest.

   Note: If you want to create a mirror volume enabled for data at rest
   encryption for a source volume not enabled for data at rest encryption,
   set the value to true for dare property when creating the mirror
   volume.

   This section describes how to enable data at rest encryption at the
   cluster and volume levels.

Enabling Data at Rest Encryption at the Cluster Level from the Command-Line

   To enable encryption at the cluster level:
    1. Run [5]configure.sh with the -dare and -genkeys option on a CLDB
       node.
       For example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N <cluster-name> -secure -dare -genkeys -C <CLDB-
node-list> -Z <ZK-node-list>
       The Master Key is generated and stored in a master key file at
       /opt/mapr/conf/dare.master.key. When CLDB comes up, it creates all
       the tables and sets the value for the following CLDB configuration
       properties to 1 to allow encryption of data at the volume level:
          + mfs.enable.dare
          + mapr.volume.dare.default
       You can verify that these parameter values are correctly set by
       running the [6]config load command. For example:
# maprcli config load -json
{
        "timestamp":1524669009979,
        "timeofday":"2018-04-25 08:10:09.979 GMT-0700 AM",
        "status":"OK",
        "total":1,
        "data":[
                {
                        "bulk.container.create.support":"1",
                        "cldb.accept.unknown.replica.delay.mins":"5",
                        ...,
                        "mapr.volume.dare.default":"1",
                        ...,
                        "mfs.enforce.dare":"1",
                        ....,
                        "pernode.numcntrs.alarm.thr":"50000"
                }
        ]
}
       Note: An informational alarm, reminding you to create a copy of the
       master key, is raised on the CLDB node. This is because, the loss
       of the master key can be catastrophic and irreversible. Loss of
       this key might result in loss of data. Before clearing the alarm,
       MapR strongly recommends creating a copy of this file in other
       location(s) for backup purposes.
    2. Copy the master key file (generated in step 1 above) to
       /opt/mapr/conf directory on all the other CLDB nodes in the
       cluster.
    3. Run [7]configure.sh on all the nodes, except the node on which the
       command was run to generate the master key (in step 1), with the
       -dare option.
       For example:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -N <cluster-name> -secure -dare -C <CLDB-node-list
> -Z <ZK-node-list>

   If this is a new installation, no additional steps are needed. You have
   enabled data at rest encryption at the cluster level and, by default,
   all new volumes are enabled for data at rest encryption. You can,
   however, still create volumes that are not enabled for encryption of
   data at rest. See [8]Enabling or Disabling Data at Rest Encryption at
   the Volume Level Using the MapR Control System or [9]Enabling or
   Disabling Data at Rest Encryption at the Volume Level Using the CLI and
   REST API for more information.

Enabling or Disabling Data at Rest Encryption at the Volume Level Using the
MapR Control System

   You can enable data at rest encryption at the volume level only if data
   at rest encryption is enabled at the cluster level. If necessary, refer
   to [10]Determining if a Secure Cluster is Enabled for Encryption Using
   the MapR Control System to determine if the cluster is enabled for
   encryption of data at rest before enabling data at rest encryption on a
   volume.
   Note: If you do not wish to encrypt data-at-rest in a volume, you can
   disable encryption when you create a volume; you cannot modify
   data-at-rest encryption setting on a volume after the volume is
   created.

   To enable or disable data-at-rest encryption for a new volume using
   MCS:
    1. Log in to MCS and click Data > Volumes.
    2. Click Create Volume to display the Create New Volume page.
    3. Select volume type, specify values for required and optional
       properties, and set the value for the Data at Rest Encryption
       property to Yes (to enable) or No (to disable).
       See [11]Creating a Volume for more information.
    4. Click Create Volume to create a volume enabled for encryption of
       data at rest.

Enabling or Disabling Data at Rest Encryption at the Volume Level Using the
CLI and REST API

   You can enable DARE at the volume level only if data at rest encryption
   is enabled at the cluster level. If necessary, refer to [12]Determining
   if a Secure Cluster is Enabled for Encryption of Data at Rest Using the
   CLI and REST API to determine if the cluster is enabled for encryption
   of data at rest before enabling a volume for data at rest encryption.
   Note: If you do not wish to encrypt data-at-rest in a volume, you can
   disable encryption when you create a volume; you cannot modify
   data-at-rest encryption setting on a volume after the volume is
   created.
     * [13]CLI
     * [14]REST

   Set the value for the dare parameter to one of the following when you
   create the volume:
     * true to enable data-at-rest encryption.
       Note: This is the default value.
       For example:
maprcli volume create -name <volName> -path <volMountPath> [-dare true]
     * false to disable data-at-rest encryption.
       For example:
maprcli volume create -name <volName> -path <volMountPath> -dare false

   Send a request of type POST and set the value for the dare parameter to
   one of the following when you create the volume:
     * true to enable data-at-rest encryption.
       Note: This is the default value.
       For example:
curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/volume/create?name=<volName>&path=<
volMountPath>[&dare=true]' --user mapr:mapr
     * false to disable data-at-rest encryption.
       For example:
curl -k -X POST 'https://abc.sj.us:8443/rest/volume/create?name=<volName>&path=<
volMountPath>&dare=false' --user mapr:mapr

   See [15]volume create for more information.
