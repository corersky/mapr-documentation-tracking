Managing Audit Logs for Filesystem and Table Operations

   There are three parameters that you can use to manage audit logs for
   filesystem and table operations:
     * -maxSize
     * -retention
     * -coalesce

   You can set the first two parameters with the maprcli audit data
   command. You can set the third parameter with the maprcli volume audit
   command.

Effects of the -maxSize parameter

   When you enable auditing with the [1]maprcli audit data command, you
   can use the -maxSize parameter to specify the size at which an alarm is
   raised concerning the size of the audit volume. The alarm is displayed
   on the dashboard in MCS and in the output of the [2]maprcli alarm list
   command. This alarm simply means that the threshold size has been
   reached. Audited operations are still logged to the audit volume in
   question.

   There are three actions that you can take:
     * If you decide that you want to be notified when the audit volume
       reaches a smaller or larger size, you can change the threshold by
       running the [3]maprcli audit data command and changing the value of
       the -maxSize parameter.
     * If you want to try preventing audit log files from growing as
       quickly as they are, you can change the number of identical
       operations that are logged within a number of minutes. Run the
       [4]maprcli audit data command and increase the value of the
       -coalesce parameter. This parameter is described below.
     * If you are concerned about longer-term space requirements for
       storing audit log files, you can change the number of days to keep
       old log files before they are deleted. Run the [5]maprcli audit
       data command and decrease the value of the -retention parameter.
       This parameter is also described below.

Effects of the -retention parameter

   When you enable auditing with the [6]maprcli audit data command, you
   can use the -retention parameter to specify how many days to keep old
   log files.

   Audit logs are rotated every night at midnight UTC time . The saved
   audit logs are kept until the retention period expires.

   For example, suppose the retention period is 30 days. The node
   192.168.10.15 in the volume /myVolume contains 30 days of saved log
   files for file-system operations and the current date is March 30,
   2016. The directory /var/mapr/local/102.168.10.15/audit/ contains these
   log files:

   FSAudit.log.json-30-03–2016-001

   FSAudit.log.json-29-03–2016-001

   FSAudit.log.json-28-03–2016-001

   …

   FSAudit.log.json-01-03–2016-001
   Note: If MFS is restarted on the same day, audit logs gets rotated, and
   new files with convention -002, -003, and so on are created with each
   restart.

   If there is no more disk space for new entries in audit logs, audit
   logging stops.

   If the size of the audit log volume exceeds its quota, an alarm is
   raised, though logging continues. The alarm is
   VOLUME_ALARM_ADVISORY_QUOTA_EXCEEDED. You can view alarms in [7]MCS or
   by running the command [8]maprcli alarm list. The default quota is 32
   GB.

Effects of the -coalesce parameter

   This parameter sets an interval during which READ, WRITE, or GETATTR
   operations on one file from one client IP address are logged only once.

   For example, suppose that a client application reads a single file
   three times in 6 minutes, so that there is one read at 0 minutes,
   another at 3 minutes, and a final read at 6 minutes. If the coalesce
   interval is at least 6 minutes, then only the first read operation is
   logged. However, if the interval is between 4 minutes, then only the
   first and third read operations are logged. If the interval is 2
   minutes, all three read operations are logged.

   You can set this interval on individual volumes. The default value is
   60 minutes. Setting this field to a larger number helps prevent audit
   logs from growing quickly.
