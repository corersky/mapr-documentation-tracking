Auditing in MapR

   MapR allows you to log audit records of cluster-administration
   operations and operations on directories, files, and tables.

   Auditing creates audit records of maprcli commands, REST API calls, and
   other actions performed on a cluster through the MapR Control System
   (MCS). Auditing records many different types of operations on
   directories, files, MapR-DB tables, and streams in log files in various
   locations in your MapR cluster. You can then process the information in
   these log files with Apache Drill or other tools. For an overview of
   how auditing works and the wide variety of ways you can use auditing,
   see [1]Auditing of Cluster Administration and Operations on
   Directories, Files, and Tables.

   More information is available for using auditing in [2]cluster
   administration or [3]file system and table operations. The
   [4]information on audit log files can be used to interpret auditing
   messages.
