Configuring PAM

   Describes how PAM works with MapR.

   MapR uses [1]Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for password
   verification in a variety of places. Make sure PAM is installed and
   configured on the node running the mapr-apiserver, or other components
   that will use PAM to verify passwords.

   There are typically several PAM modules (profiles), configurable via
   configuration files in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. Any component
   verifying user passwords tries the following three profiles in order:
    1. sudo (/etc/pam.d/sudo)
    2. sshd (/etc/pam.d/sshd)
    3. mapr-admin (If you have created the /etc/pam.d/mapr-admin profile
       and the component checks beyond the first two profiles.)

   The profile configuration file (for example, /etc/pam.d/sudo) should
   contain an entry corresponding to the authentication scheme used by
   your system. For example, if you are using the simplest form of local
   OS authentication, check for an entry similar to the following -
   consult with your Unix system administrator if you are uncertain:
auth    sufficient      pam_unix.so  # For local OS Auth

Component-specific PAM Configurations

   Some ecosystem components have unique requirements that require setup
   of a component-specific PAM configuration. See the [2]Ecosystem Guide
   for the specific Ecosystem component.
