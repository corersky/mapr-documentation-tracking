Configuring SPNEGO on MapR

   MapR uses the Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism
   (SPNEGO) to secure several Web UIs in a secure cluster, as well as the
   REST calls to the MapR Control System (MCS).

Configuring SPNEGO for the Web Server Nodes on Secure Clusters

   The following procedure configures SPNEGO support for the apiserver
   nodes on your secure cluster.
    1. Generate a Kerberos principal with the user name HTTP, of the form
       HTTP/<webserver name> on each node in the secure cluster that will
       receive inbound SPNEGO traffic.
       Use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) as the name in the
       principal. Although you could also use a short name or the IP
       address for the principal name, using the FQDN keeps the name
       consistent with principal names that configure.sh generates and
       includes in the mapr.login.conf file.
       Whatever you use as the principal name is what users will have to
       match exactly in a browser to access the web pages that are
       protected.
       Note: Several services and components in a MapR cluster handle
       SPNEGO traffic, including the MCS. You can name the keytab file
       mapr.keytab if that file does not already exist. If the mapr.keytab
       file already exists, generate the new principal to a different file
       name and merge it to the mapr.keytab file using the ktutil tool.
       For example:
kadmin
 : addprinc -randkey HTTP/<webserver name>
 : ktadd -k /opt/mapr/conf/mapr.keytab HTTP/<webserver name>
    2. Verify that the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr.login.conf file lists the
       correct principal in the MAPR_WEBSERVER_KERBEROS section.
       To enable SPNEGO for MCS Web UI or for MCS REST calls, on all nodes
       with the webserver role, add the following line to the
       /opt/mapr/apiserver/conf/properties.cfg file. For example:
mapr.rest.auth.methods=kerberos,basic
       Important: The mapr.rest.auth.methods=kerberos,basic option, which
       is shown above, is valid only on a secure cluster. If a cluster is
       not secure, only basic authentication (WWW-Authenticate: Basic) is
       available to clients.
    3. Restart the MCS for the changes to take effect.

Testing SPNEGO With curl

   This example tests that the MCS is using GSS for REST calls made with
   curl.
   Use the following command to verify that your version of curl supports
   SPNEGO. Under the Features header, output of the command should show
   either GSS-Negotiate or SPNEGO. For example:
# curl --versioncurl 7.22.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0
OpenSSL/1.0.1 zlib/1.2.3.4 libidn/1.23 librtmp/2.3Protocols:
dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp smtp s
mtps telnet tftp
Features: GSS-Negotiate IDN IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz TLS-SRP

   Verify that you have a valid Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) with
   the kinit -p <user> command,. Then, test curl with the following
   command:
curl --negotiate -u : -b ~/cookiejar.txt -c ~/cookiejar.txt
https://<web server node>:8443/rest/<API call> -k -v

   This command returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK when curl is working correctly
   with SPNEGO.

Configuring Browsers for SPNEGO

   Use the following processes to configure browsers for SPNEGO
   connections.

   Firefox
   The process below configures your Firefox browser for SPNEGO
   connections.
   Note: These instructions are specific for Firefox version 40.0.3xj. The
   details may differ slightly if you are using a different version.
    1. Open the Firefox configuration page by navigating to the address
       about:config.
    2. In the Search text field, enter network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris
       to bring up that property.
    3. Right-click on network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris and select
       Modify to edit the property and enter the hostnames of the web
       server nodes in your cluster as a comma-separated list.
    4. Click OK.

   Chromium on Ubuntu
   To configure the Chromium browser on Ubuntu for SPNEGO, edit the
   /etc/chromium-browser/default file and add the following property:
CHROMIUM_FLAGS="--user-data-dir --auth-server-whitelist=<web server host names>"

   The --user-data-dir flag enables the root user to launch the browser.
   The --auth-server-whitelist flag specifies the web servers that support
   SPNEGO authentication.
