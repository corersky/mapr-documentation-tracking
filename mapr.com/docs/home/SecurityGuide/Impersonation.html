Impersonation in MapR

   Describes impersonation in MapR, which allows centralized control of
   access to resources in the MapR Filesystem, MapR Database, and MapR
   Event Store For Apache Kafka.

   Also known as identity assertion, impersonation is one user (authorized
   to impersonate another) or the mapr super user accessing data and
   submitting jobs on behalf of another user. Implementing impersonation
   provides authoritative, end-to-end security for your MapR installation,
   independent of remote authentication and security mechanisms that
   control user access to application features.

   To implement impersonation in MapR, there are both MapR core and
   ecosystem component requirements that must be met as well as
   requirements at the application development level. These requirements
   are described in [1]Access Control and Impersonation in MapR.

   When all other requirements are met, enabling impersonation [2]for the
   mapr superuser or [3]for any other user is a simple task.
