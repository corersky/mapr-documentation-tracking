Selective Auditing of MapR Filesystem, MapR Database Table, and MapR Event
Store For Apache Kafka Operations Using the CLI

   Administrators can specify filesystem, table, or stream operations to
   include or exclude from auditing. The operations that can be included
   or excluded from auditing are listed [1]here.

   Including or excluding specific operations from auditing requires
   running the [2]maprcli command. You can specify the list of operations
   to include or exclude from auditing during volume creation using
   [3]maprcli volume create command and afterwards using [4]maprcli volume
   modify or [5]maprcli volume audit command.

   To:
     * Include operations for auditing, use the plus sign (+) before the
       operation.
     * Exclude operations from auditing, use the minus sign (-) before the
       operation.
       Note: If the first operation in the list is to be excluded from
       auditing, it must be preceded by two minus (--) signs. Subsequent
       operations to exclude from auditing must be preceded by only a
       single minus (-) sign, whether or not the first operation was
       included (using a plus (+) sign) or excluded (using two minus (--)
       signs).

   Note: If neither (plus (+) or minus (-)) sign is specified before an
   operation, the given operation is included for auditing.
