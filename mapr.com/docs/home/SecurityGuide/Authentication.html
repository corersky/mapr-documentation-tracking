Authentication in MapR

   Describes types of authentication available with the MapR Data Platform
   and how to manage user authentication with the maprlogin utility.

   Authentication ensures who you are and who you claim you are in
   identifying the end user to the system. MapR authentication supports
   standard Basic Authentication and SPNEGO authentication for web-based
   interfaces and supports MapR tickets for many of the core system
   component non-web-based interfaces. A ticket is an object that contains
   specific information about a user, an expiration time, and a key.
   Tickets uniquely identify a user and are encrypted to protect their
   contents. You can use tickets to establish sessions between a user and
   the cluster.

Types of Authentication in MapR

   MapR supports two methods of authenticating a user and generating a
   ticket: a username-password pair and Kerberos. Both of these methods
   are mediated by the [1]maprlogin utility. When you authenticate with a
   username-password pair, the system verifies your credentials using
   Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). You can configure the cluster
   to use any registry that has a PAM module.

   MapR tickets contain the following information:
     * UID (generated from the UNIX user ID)
     * GIDs (group IDs for each group the user belongs to)
     * ticket creation time
     * ticket expiration time (by default, 14 days)
     * renewal expiration time (by default, 30 days from the date of
       ticket creation)

   A MapR ticket determines the user's identity and the system uses the
   ticket as the basis for authorization. A MapR cluster with security
   features enabled does not rely on the client-side operating system
   identity.

The maprlogin Utility for Generating Tickets

   The [2]maprlogin utility supports user authentication with either
   username and password or Kerberos to generate a unique session token
   called a ticket. The following diagram outlines the process flow:
   [maprlogin.png]

   MapR tickets are either implicitly or explicitly generated. On clusters
   that use Kerberos for authentication, a user that runs a MapR command
   without first using the maprlogin utility implicitly obtains a MapR
   ticket. During usage, the client runtime process first checks for a
   valid user ticket, and uses that ticket if it exists. If a ticket does
   not exist, the runtime process checks if Kerberos is enabled for the
   cluster and then checks for an existing valid Kerberos identity. When a
   valid Kerberos identity is found, the client implicitly generates a
   ticket for that Kerberos identity.

   When you explicitly generate a ticket, you can authenticate either with
   your username and password or with Kerberos:
    1. The user on the client machine invokes the maprlogin utility, which
       connects to a CLDB node in the cluster using HTTPS. The host name
       for the CLDB node is specified in the mapr-clusters.conf file.
          + For username-password authentication, the node authenticates
            using PAM modules with the Java Authentication and
            Authorization Service (JAAS).
            The JAAS configuration is specified in the [3]mapr.login.conf
            file. The system can use any registry that has a PAM module
            available.
          + For Kerberos authentication, the CLDB node verifies the
            Kerberos principal with the keytab file.
    2. After authenticating, the CLDB node uses the standard UNIX APIs
       getpwnam_r and getgrouplist, which are controlled by the
       /etc/nsswitch.conf file, to determine the user's user IDs and group
       IDs.
    3. The CLDB node generates a ticket and returns it to the client
       machine, completing the login communication between the client and
       the CLDB.
    4. After login, the MapR server validates that the ticket is properly
       encrypted, to verify that the ticket was issued by the cluster's
       CLDB.
    5. The server also verifies that the ticket has not expired or been
       blacklisted.
    6. The server checks the ticket for a privileged identity such as the
       mapr user.
       Privileged identities have impersonation functionality enabled.
    7. The ticket's user and group information are used for authorization
       to the cluster, unless impersonation is in effect.
