Authentication in MapR

   Describes robust MapR authentication that prevents third parties from
   representing themselves as legitimate users.

   Authentication ensures that the identity of the end user or system is
   known reliably in a network safe way. The core component of user
   authentication in MapR is the ticket. A ticket is an object that
   contains specific information about a user, an expiration time, and a
   key. Tickets uniquely identify a user and are encrypted to protect
   their contents. You can use tickets to establish sessions between a
   user and the cluster.

Types of Authentication in MapR

   MapR supports two methods of authenticating a user and generating a
   ticket: a username-password pair and Kerberos. Both of these methods
   are mediated by the [1]maprlogin utility. When you authenticate with a
   username-password pair, the system verifies your credentials using
   Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). You can configure the cluster
   to use any registry that has a PAM module.

   MapR tickets contain the following information:
     * UID (generated from the UNIX user ID)
     * GIDs (group IDs for each group the user belongs to)
     * ticket creation time
     * ticket expiration time (by default, 14 days)
     * renewal expiration time (by default, 30 days from the date of
       ticket creation)

   A MapR ticket determines the user's identity and the system uses the
   ticket as the basis for authorization. A MapR cluster with security
   features enabled does not rely on the client-side operating system
   identity.

   The [2]Security Architecture section discusses the implementation
   details of these authentication methods.
