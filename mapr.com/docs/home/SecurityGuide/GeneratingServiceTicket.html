Generating a Service Ticket

   Applications may have service processes that run outside the MapR
   cluster but need to access the cluster to run MapR commands. For
   security reasons, you may not want to run these services as the mapr
   user. Instead, you can use the maprlogin utility to generate a "service
   ticket" that can be used to access the cluster for the user account
   that runs the service. The maprlogin utility uses the current user's
   ticket (the user running the maprlogin command) to send an
   authenticated request for a newly generated service ticket.

   This type of ticket has a specified duration (expiration), a renewal
   period (maximum lifetime), and a designated location where the ticket
   is safely stored. The service process that uses the ticket can access
   it based on the definition of the MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment
   variable, which points to the location of the ticket and should be set
   for the service process when it starts. Short duration and renewal
   values may be used for security reasons, but much longer lifetimes are
   supported for ease of administration.

   For example:
# maprlogin generateticket -type service -out /tmp/longlived_ticket -duration 30
:0:0 -renewal 90:0:0 -user mapr
MapR credentials of user 'mapr' for cluster 'xxxx' are written to '/tmp/longlive
d_ticket'

   This command generates a service ticket that expires after 30 days and
   is stored in /tmp/longlived_ticket. The ticket may be renewed at any
   time before the 30 days pass, extending its lifetime to a maximum of 90
   days. The ticket must be renewed explicitly before its expiration date;
   it does not renew automatically when it expires.
   Note: This type of ticket can only be generated by a user with full
   control on a cluster's Access Control List (ACL).
