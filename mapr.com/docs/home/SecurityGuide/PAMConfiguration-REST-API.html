Configuring PAM for MCS and REST API

   Starting in MapR v6.0, no additional configuration is needed to use PAM
   files for authentication. The apiserver supports PAM and automatically
   loads the following PAM files, if they exist, in the following order
   for authentication:
/etc/pam.d/mapr-admin
/etc/pam.d/sudo
/etc/pam.d/sshd
/etc/pam.d/chkpasswd
/etc/pam.d/passed

   However, you can [1]create a custom PAM profile and set the admin
   server property to point to a specific PAM file to use for
   authentication:
    1. Open the /opt/mapr/apiserver/conf/properties.cfg file and set the
       PAM file as the value for the authentication.pam.service property.
       For example, to set mapr-admin as the file to use for
       authentication, your entry in the file should look similar to the
       following:
ojai.cache.size=64
mapr.webui.https.port=8443
doc.url=https://maprdocs.mapr.com/home
proxy.zkservices=elasticsearch,opentsdb
authentication.pam.service=mapr-admin
    2. Save and close the file.
