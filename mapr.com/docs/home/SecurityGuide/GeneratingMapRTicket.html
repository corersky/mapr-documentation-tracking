Generating a MapR Ticket from a Kerberos Ticket

   On clusters that use Kerberos for authentication, a MapR ticket is
   implicitly obtained for a user that runs a MapR command without first
   using the maprlogin utility.

   If you want to use a Kerberos ticket to generate a maprticket, follow
   these steps:
    1. Obtain a Kerberos identity by running kinit or by another
       mechanism.
    2. Run maprlogin kerberos to indicate that you have an existing
       Kerberos ticket. You can also specify these options: [ -cluster ]
       The name of the cluster. [ -duration ] The ticket duration in
       seconds.
