Streaming Audit Logs

   Audit-streaming (available from v6.0.1) eliminates the need to process
   the logs nightly using the [1]expandaudit utility and provides a way to
   process the audit data real-time. The audit data is sent as a audit
   stream as the audit data is generated, opening the possibility for
   real-time processing of the audit data. You can use it to monitor data
   access such as:
     * Who accessed certain files, tables, and/or streams at certain times
     * What type of action is/was performed on the files, tables, and/or
       streams
     * How many failed attempts on the files, tables, and/or streams in a
       certain period
     * When did a particular property or configuration change and who
       changed it

   Audit streaming is not enabled by default; you can [2]enable audit
   streaming using the CLI. If the feature is enabled, MapR-FS, MapR-DB,
   and MapR-ES operation-related audit logs and CLDB and auth audit logs
   are available as MapR-ES topics. The audit-streaming consumer can view
   all audited operations on a node in the cluster in near real time by
   subscribing to one or more topics associated with a node.

   The audit stream is created when the hoststats process starts. If the
   hoststats process is restarted, the audit stream starts publishing to
   topics from where it left off processing audit logs; some audit log
   entries might be republished.

   The audit log stream topic is available in the following location:
/var/mapr/auditstream/

   Topics named <clusterName>_<logType>_<nodeName> are published to the
   stream
   (/var/mapr/auditstream/auditlogstream:<clustername>_<logType>_<nodename
   >). Here:
     * <clustername> is the name of the cluster.
     * <logType> is the type of log. Valid types are cldb, auth, fs, and
       db (for both MapR-DB and MapR-ES logs).
     * <nodeName> is the hostname of the node on which the operation was
       logged.

   The message is in JSON format and is identical to the the audit log
   content, as in the following example:
{"timestamp":{"$date":"2017-04-27T10:53:37.239Z"},"operation":"CREATE","uid":0,"
ipAddress":"10.20.30.140","nfsServer":"10.20.30.140","parentFid":"2066.32.131358
","childFid":"2066.33.262630","childName":"abc.txt","volumeId":106738640,"status
":0}

   Messages in the topics are stored by default for 7 days. Only the mapr
   user can consume the stream. Refer to [3]Sample Cached Consumer
   Application for Audit Stream and [4]Sample Uncached Consumer
   Application for Audit Stream for information on consuming the messages
   using the sample consumers.
