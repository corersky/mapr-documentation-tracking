Configuring Mapr Security

   Provides usage information for frequently used security functionality,
   including Access Control Lists (ACLs), Access Control Expressions
   (ACEs), file permissions, and subnet whitelisting.
   Note: MapR 6.0 makes it easier to secure new MapR installations. For
   more information, see [1]Built-in Security in MapR.

   Wired encryption and authentication (including impersonation) for the
   MapR platform and all supported ecosystem products are enabled for new
   installations through the [2]MapR Installer.

   You can enable security features at any time, but additional
   configuration is required for the individual components to work with
   security enabled. This section discusses initial configuration of a
   secure cluster as well as other forms of security.

   The following access control elements are available whether or not your
   cluster security features are enabled. Additionally, once security
   features are enabled, these elements benefit from encrypted traffic
   within the cluster and strong authentication to the cluster.
     * Access Control Lists (ACLs) for the cluster, the volumes in the
       cluster, and the MapReduce application queue
     * Access Control Expressions (ACEs) control user permissions for
       directories, files, and MapR-DB tables that are stored natively
     * File permissions for objects in the MapR-FS layer
     * Subnet whitelisting restricts access to the cluster's FileServer
       service

   On clusters with security features enabled, Ecosystem components may
   require additional configuration. For example, Hive functionality has
   different security requirements depending on the interaction between
   the HiveServer2 component, the Hive command-line interface, and the
   Hive metastore.

   See the [3]MapR Security Support Matrix for more information about
   supported security options for Ecosystem components. See the specific
   Ecosystem component in the [4]Ecosystem Components for information on
   security configuration.

   See [5]Security Vulnerabilities for a list of known vulnerabilities.
