Using Java Applications with Secure Clusters

   Describes ramifications associated with using Java applications in a
   MapR secure environment.

   A secure computing environment places additional requirements on the
   Java Virtual Machine (JVM) properties of Java clients. The JVMs
   launched by MapR with scripts, such as those used by the maprcli,
   hadoop, or hbase commands, have those properties automatically set by
   the MapR software. The MapR software attempts to set useful values for
   these properties.

   When a JVM is used or launched directly, such as when you write a
   stand-alone Java program, any Java code that sets values for the
   following properties may cause issues on your cluster.
   Property Default Value Description
   java.security.auth.login.config /opt/mapr/conf/mapr.login.conf Path to
   the file that specifies JAAS configurations used by MapR.
   javax.net.ssl.trustStore /opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore Controls the
   truststore used by MapR clients for HTTPS connections.
   http.auth.preference basic The default setting disables JVM's default
   handling of SPNEGO, enabling MapR's Hadoop code to handle SPNEGO
   authentication.
   zookeeper.saslprovider com.mapr.security.maprsasl.MaprSaslProvider
   Enables ZooKeeper security.
   hadoop.login hadoop_default Controls the JAAS configuration used by
   MapR security.
