Security Exceptions

   "Secure by default" means network-safe authentication and encryption.
   This page describes areas in which secure-by-default capabilities are
   not yet implemented for the MapR platform or ecosystem components.
   Included where applicable are links to more information to help you
   work around those issues.

Flume

   Flume does not provide encryption by default for secure clusters but
   can be secured through manual configuration. See [1]Configuring Flume.
   In addition, Flume does not support any authentication mechanism for an
   Avro client.

Hive

   Any user using beeline can install Java code as a Hive hook. On the
   MapR platform, these hooks run as the mapr user, which could represent
   a security vulnerability. To prevent a malicious user from using Hive
   hooks to install malware on a MapR cluster, the cluster admin should
   add the following properties to the default value of
   hive.conf.restricted.list in the hive-site.xml file, and then restart
   HiveServer 2 (HS2):
     * hive.exec.pre.hooks
     * hive.exec.post.hooks
     * hive.exec.failure.hooks
     * hive.exec.query.redactor.hooks

   Adding the properties prevents a non-admin user from installing hooks
   into Hive. For more information, see [2]Preventing a Non-Administrative
   User from Installing Hooks.

Hue

   Certificate verification is disabled on Hue.

Impala

   Impala is not secure by default, but encryption and authentication can
   be enabled. See [3]Impala Security.

KSQL

   KSQL does not support encryption between a KSQL client and KSQL server.

NFSv3

   NFSv3 is not secure by default, and there are no provisions for
   authentication or network encryption.

NFSv4

   NFSv4 is not secure by default, but it can be secured using Kerberos to
   enable both encryption and authentication. See [4]Configuring NFSv4
   Server for Kerberos.

OpenTSDB

   There is no authentication or network encryption by default for read
   access over REST, and authentication and encryption cannot be enabled.
   However, note that no updates are allowed over REST; therefore,
   intruders cannot alter cluster metric data.

ZooKeeper

   ZooKeeper supports server-to-server authentication by default, but
   ZooKeeper does not support encryption and cannot be configured to do
   so.
