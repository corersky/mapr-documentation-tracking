Creating Cluster-level ACLs

   A cluster-level Access Control List (ACL) determines who has access to
   a cluster and which actions they are allowed to perform. ACLs on a
   secure MapR cluster are predicated on a locally managed OS registry.
   Important: Before you create an ACL that applies to a particular group,
   you must create that group and assign users to it.

   For example, the Red Hat Linux commands for creating a group called
   developers and adding a user named jsmith on a locally managed OS
   registry are:
groupadd developers
useradd -g developers jsmith

   Once users and groups have been defined, an administrator can create a
   cluster-level ACL using MCS and the CLI.

Creating an ACL from the MCS

    1. Click Admin > User Settings > Permissions.
    2. Follow steps for [1]Adding Cluster Permissions.
       Each allowed action has a permission code associated with it. The
       codes are explained below.

   CAPTION:

   Permission Code Allowed Action
   login Log in to the MapR Control System, use the API and command-line
   interface, read access on cluster and volumes.

   Note: Read access allows you to only view the MapR objects that already
   exist. You cannot create volumes, policies, schedules, snapshots, nor
   any other MapR objects.
   ss Start/stop services
   cv Create volumes
   a Administrative access to cluster ACLs. Grants no other permissions.
   fc Full control over the cluster. This enables all cluster-related
   administrative options with the exception of changing the cluster ACLs.

Creating an ACL from the Command Line

   To create an ACL at the command line, use the acl set command. Include
   spaces between multiple entries, such as a list of usernames and their
   associated permission levels (or actions).

   The syntax is:
maprcli acl set -type volume -name <volume name>
               [-group <groupname>:<action> -user <username>:<action>]

   Note: The acl set command removes previously set permissions if they
   are not explicitly called out in the command line.

   Other ACL commands include:
     * [2]acl edit - to modify permissions in an ACL (use this command
       instead of acl set to change some permissions while leaving others
       intact)
     * [3]acl show - to display permissions in an ACL

Example

   To create an ACL for a cluster named my.cluster.com that allows
   administration of cluster ACLs to user root and control over all other
   aspects of the cluster to all users in the developers group, enter this
   command:
maprcli acl set -type cluster -cluster my.cluster.com -user root:a -group develo
pers:fc

   Now suppose you want to change the developers group permissions so they
   can only log in and start or stop services. Use the acl edit command as
   shown:
maprcli acl edit -type cluster -cluster my.cluster.com -group developers:login,s
s

   Note that only the developers group's permissions change, while the
   user named root retains control over the cluster's ACL settings.
