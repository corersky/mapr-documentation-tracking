SSL Certificates

   Describes how certificates are used to perform authentication and
   encryption for websites that use the HTTPS protocol.

   An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate performs authentication and
   encryption for websites that use the HTTPS protocol. A certificate
   contains information about an entity and contains a public key. The
   public key is related to a private key which is NOT part of the
   certificate, but it is used by one entity when it communicates with
   another entity.

   MapR stores the private key and certificate in a key store file called
   ssl_keystore. A certificate is also digitally signed so that it cannot
   be altered. The signer is known as the signing certificate.

   In order for an HTTPS connection to be established, the following
   criteria must be met:
     * the server must have a key file that contains a certificate and
       private key
     * the client must provide a trust file that contains a signer who
       signed the certificate used by the server
     * the server certificate must be valid and not expired
     * the client must determine that the SubjectDN in the certificate is
       acceptable

   The process of enabling MapR security generates the common ssl_keystore
   and ssl_truststore files on the first CLDB server that are used by all
   clients and servers.
     * The ssl_keystore contains a single self-signed certificate with a
       wildcard SubjectDN (for example, if the hostname of the CLDB is
       a.b.com the SubjectDN would be CN=*.b.com).
     * The ssl_truststore contains the signer for the certificate in the
       ssl_keystore.

   The REST API calls in a MapR cluster communicate over the HTTPS
   protocol on port 8443. These calls are secured with SSL certificates
   that identify a node to the cluster.
