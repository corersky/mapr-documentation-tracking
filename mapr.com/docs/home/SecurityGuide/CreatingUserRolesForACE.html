Creating User Roles for ACEs

   Roles are a label attached to a set of users that defines a common task
   or set of behaviors for those users. Roles enable you to use
   functionality similar to Unix groups for your users without requiring
   you to alter your system's existing group hierarchy. A role's name can
   be up to 64 characters long and cannot use the :, &, |, or !
   characters. User roles are defined in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/m7_permissions_roles_refimpl.conf file, which must be
   identical across all nodes in the cluster. The
   m7_permissions_roles_refimpl.conf file has the following format:
# The # character indicates comments. Role names must end with a : character.
rolename1:
# Usernames or user IDs are specified on a line after the role name. You can mix
 user names and user IDs.
username1|userid1
username2|userid2
...
usernameN|useridN
rolename2:
...
# The m7_security_ref_impl.conf file can have any number of blank lines.
rolenameN:

   After adding a new role to the m7_permissions_roles_refimpl.conf file,
   you must issue the following command to enable the MapR Filesystem
   layer to pick up the new role:
$ /opt/mapr/server/mrconfig dbrolescache invalidate

   Note: This command must be run on all the nodes whenever there is a
   change in the roles configuration file.

The Roles Library Shared Object and Access Control Expressions

   By default, the roles library shared object libmapr_roles_refimpl.so is
   located in the /opt/mapr/server/permissions/ directory. This shared
   object uses the C++ syntax and contains the GetSecurityMembership
   class. Each time an object secured by an ACE is accessed, the MapR
   Filesystem layer calls the roles library shared object and checks the
   permissions of the entity requesting access against the contents of the
   roles file. The roles library shared object reads the roles file every
   600 seconds. You can specify your own roles library shared object and
   specify the location of that object using the parameter
   mfs.dbroles.sopath in the [1]/opt/mapr/conf/mfs.conf file.
