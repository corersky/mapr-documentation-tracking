Creating User Roles for ACEs

   Note: It is recommended to use Unix Groups over Roles whenever
   possible, for centralized maintainence. Use Roles only when you are
   unable to modify LDAP or AD groups easily.

   A role is a label attached to a set of users, which defines a common
   task, or set of behaviors for those users. Roles enable you to use
   functionality similar to Unix groups for your users, without requiring
   you to alter the existing group hierarchy of your system. Role names
   can be up to 64 characters long, and cannot use the :, &, |, or !
   characters.

Standard Reference Implementation

   User Information

   The standard reference implementation is a library called
   libmapr_roles_refimpl.so. This library is located at
   /opt/mapr/server/permissions. This library opens a configuration file
   named m7_permissions_roles_refimpl.conf, which should contain a list of
   all the roles, and the users associated with those given roles. This
   configuration file is located at /opt/mapr/conf, and should be
   identical across all clusters.

   The structure of the configuration file is as follows. Roles end with
   :, while user names are written on each subsequent line. For example:
Role_1:
            user_a
            user_b
Role_2:
            user_b
            user_c
            user_d
            #comment

   This example file states that there are two roles to choose from when
   assigning permissions - Role_1 and Role_2. The users located under
   Role_1 are user_aand user_b. Role_2 contains user_b, user_c, and
   user_d. Blank lines, and lines beginning with # are ignored.

   Assume a table has permissions r:Role_2. user_b has access to this
   table, while user_a does not have access.

   After adding a new role to the m7_permissions_roles_refimpl.conf file,
   you must issue the following command to enable the MapR Filesystem
   layer to pick up the new role: $ /opt/mapr/server/mrconfig dbrolescache
   invalidate

   Run this command on all the nodes, whenever there is a change in the
   roles configuration file.
   Developer Information

   The functions that the libmapr_roles_refimpl.so exposes, are found in
   the extensibility implementation. When the library is called initially
   through GetSecurityMembership, it parses the
   m7_permissions_roles_refimpl.conf file, and loads it into memory. All
   user names are read, and parsed into user IDs (uid_t). If a user ID is
   not found, the ID is skipped.

   The library uses a HashTable. The roles are the keys. The values are a
   Binary tree of user IDs.

   Each call checks the given user ID and role. The HashTable keys off the
   role, and then searches the Binary Tree for the user ID. If the
   HashTable finds a user ID, it sets that role boolean value to true. If
   the HashTable does not find a userI D, or if any errors occur, such as
   Role not found, it sets the boolean value to false.

   There is also a cleanup method which frees the memory allocated to the
   HashTable, along with all of its children. If the GetSecurityMembership
   method is called again, the library reloads the configuration file, and
   loads all the values into memory.

Extensible Implementation

   If users decide not to use the reference implementation, they can
   replace the shared library with their own. In the mfs.conf file, add a
   parameter that specifies the name of the file. If the name of the file
   is changed, then MFS searches /opt/mapr/server/permissions for the new
   file. If the file is found, it is loaded into memory. If not, then all
   roles evaluate to false.

   The user's shared library should contain two functions specified under
   the mapr::fs namespace:
extern "C"
            void GetSecurityMembership(uid_t uid, const char *roles[], int numRo
les, bool truthValue[]) {
            }
extern "C"
            void cleanup() {
            }

   GetSecurityMembership takes the given user ID along with a list of all
   the roles, the amount of roles in the array, and an array of all the
   results, as booleans.

   Users must code their own implementation of populating the truthValue
   array with either true or false. The truthValue array has the same
   length as numRoles, and is initialized. Do not modify any other
   variables.

   Use the cleanup method to reset the shared library to an initialized
   state. This method resets all values, and frees memory, since the
   shared library is not closed, till the class calling it, gets
   destructed.

Invoke Shared Library from MFS

   The TablePermissions class handles opening, and closing the shared
   library. During class initialization, the name of the shared library,
   which is read from the mfs.conf, file is passed to the constructor. The
   constructor loads the shared library into memory, using the LoadSO
   method from filterutils.cc. The constructor also loads the
   GetSecurityMembership method, along with the cleanup method, as
   variables that can be called.
   TablePermissions contains two methods that can be called, to access the
   shared library:
     * The GetSecurityMembership method takes 3 arguments - the user ID,
       the array of roles, and the amount of roles in the array. This
       method returns a RolePermission structure, which contains all the
       same data, as well as the boolean of the successful roles for that
       given user ID. To evaluate the user roles, pass this RolePermission
       structure to the TablePermission::checkTablePermissions method.
     * The cleanup method calls the cleanup method in the shared library.
       This method takes no arguments.

   The entity that allocates the RolePermission structure into memory,
   also needs to deallocate this structure.

   Deallocating the TablePermissions class, calls the cleanup method, and
   closes the shared library.

Shared Library Security

   The /opt/mapr/server/permissions folder is initialized with 755
   permissions. This implies that only the user who installed mapr has
   access to writing to that folder. These permissions prevent a user from
   replacing a shared library with a malicious file.

   The m7_permissions_roles_refimpl.conf file has 755 permission, which
   means that only an administrator can make changes to this file.

The Roles Library Shared Object and Access Control Expressions

   When an object secured by ACE is accessed, the MapR Filesystem layer
   calls the roles library shared object, and checks the permissions of
   the entity requesting access, against the contents of the roles file.
   The roles library shared object reads the roles file every 600 seconds.
   You can specify your own roles library shared object, and specify the
   location of that object, using the parameter mfs.dbroles.sopath in the
   [1]/opt/mapr/conf/mfs.conf file.
