Creating Job Queue ACLs

   A job queue ACL controls who can submit jobs to a queue, kill jobs, or
   modify their priority. The default behavior is that any user can submit
   a job, and jobs can only be seen and killed by the administrator or the
   user that submitted those jobs.

   To create a job queue ACL, specify the following parameters in the
   mapred-queue-acls.xml file:
   Parameter What it does
   mapred.queue.names queue1,queue2,... Names the queues to which jobs can
   be submitted.
   mapred.acls.enabled=true Indicates that ACLs will be checked whenever a
   user or group submits a job, tries to kill a job, or tries to change
   its priority. This parameter is set to true by default when [1]security
   features for your cluster are enabled.
   mapred.queue.<queue-name>.acl-submit-job user1,user2,...
   group1,group2,... Identifies the users and groups that can submit jobs
   to the specified queue-name.
   mapred.queue.<queue-name>.acl-administer-job user1,user2,...
   group1,group2,... Identifies the users and groups that can change the
   priority or kill jobs submitted to the specified queue-name. Note that
   the job owner can always kill his own job or change its priority.

   For information on configuring queue properties, see [2]Configuring
   Properties for Queues. You can also set job initialization parameters
   for a queue.
