Deleting Whole Volume ACEs

   You cannot remove ACEs that have been set; instead, if necessary, use
   the empty string ("") to deny specific types of access. If the empty
   string is used to deny a specific type of access, that type of access
   is denied to all users. To deny access to specific users only, use the
   negation operator (!).
