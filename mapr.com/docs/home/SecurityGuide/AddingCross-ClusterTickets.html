Configuring Secure Clusters for Cross-Cluster Mirroring and Replication

   Describes configuring clusters for cross-cluster operations such as
   mirroring and replication.
   Cross-cluster tickets are required on secure clusters that need to pull
   data from another secure cluster and on secure clusters that need to
   push data to another secure cluster. For example:
     * Volume mirroring is a pull operation. The volume data is pulled by
       the destination cluster from the source cluster. Since the
       destination cluster performs the operation, the destination cluster
       receives a ticket that is generated on the source cluster.
     * Table and streams replication is a push operation. The table or
       stream data is pushed from the source cluster to the destination
       cluster. Since the source cluster performs the operation, the
       source cluster receives a ticket that is generated on the
       destination cluster.

   You can configure secure clusters for cross-cluster mirroring and
   replication manually (as described in [1]Setting up Secure Clusters
   Manually for Cross-Cluster Mirroring and [2]Setting up Secure Clusters
   Manually for Cross-Cluster Replication). You can configure secure
   clusters automatically, by running the configure-crosscluster.sh
   utility. This utility configures the clusters for both mirroring and
   replication in both directions. For more information, see
   [3]configure-crosscluster.sh.

Setting up Secure Clusters Manually for Cross-Cluster Mirroring

   To set up secure clusters for cross-cluster mirroring:
    1. Verify that the user for whom you are configuring access, exists in
       the registry on both the clusters and has the following
       permissions:
          + Permissions to mirror volumes on the source cluster.
          + Permissions to create volumes on the destination cluster.
       You can set up access for the mapr user, who already has
       permissions to create volumes and mirror volumes.
    2. Log in to any node on the source cluster and perform the following
       steps:
         a. Generate a cross-cluster ticket for the destination cluster
            for this user.
            For example, to generate a cross-cluster for destination
            cluster, run the following command on the source cluster:
source$ /opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin generateticket -type crosscluster -out /tmp/cros
sclusterticket -user destinationclusteruser
         b. Copy the cross-cluster ticket file to any node on the
            destination cluster.
            For example:
source$ scp /tmp/crossclusterticket mapr@<dest-ip>:/tmp/sourceClusterTicketFile
    3. Log in to the node on the destination cluster where the
       cross-cluster ticket was copied, and perform the following steps:
         a. Merge the cross-cluster ticket file with the
            /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file on the node.
            For example, to merge, run the following command:
dest$ cat /tmp/sourceClusterTicketFile >> /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket
         b. Copy the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to the CLDB
            nodes on the destination cluster.
    4. Perform the steps to [4]verify configuration for mirroring.

   You can now create mirror volumes on the destination cluster and set up
   a schedule to pull data from the volumes on the source cluster.
   However, you cannot create volumes on the source cluster that pull data
   from volumes in the destination cluster, because the setup described
   above is unidirectional. To configure the clusters for bidirectional
   mirroring, repeat the steps above, by switching the source and
   destination clusters.

   For example, suppose there are two clusters, clusterA and clusterB, and
   you performed the steps above for clusterA as the source cluster and
   clusterB as the destination cluster. After you complete the steps
   above, your destination cluster, clusterB can pull data from volumes on
   clusterA. For clusterA to mirror data on clusterB, perform the steps
   above with clusterB as the source cluster and clusterA as the
   destination cluster.

Setting up Secure Clusters Manually for Cross-Cluster Replication

   To set up secure clusters for cross-cluster replication:
    1. Verify that the user, for whom you are configuring access, exists
       in the registry on the destination cluster.
    2. Log in to any node on the destination cluster and perform the
       following steps:
         a. Generate a cross-cluster ticket for the source cluster.
            For example, to generate a cross-cluster for the source
            cluster, run the following command on the destination cluster:
dest$ /opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin generateticket -type crosscluster -out /tmp/crossc
lusterticket -user destinationclusteruser
         b. Copy the cross-cluster ticket file to any node on the source
            cluster.
            For example:
dest$ scp /tmp/crossclusterticket mapr@<source-ip>:/tmp/sourceClusterTicketFile
    3. Log in to the node in the source cluster where the cross-cluster
       ticket was copied, and perform the following steps:
         a. Merge the cross-cluster ticket file with the
            /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file on the node.
            For example, to merge, run the following command:
cat /tmp/destinationClusterTicketFile >> /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket
         b. Copy the /opt/mapr/conf/maprserverticket file to all the nodes
            on the source cluster.
    4. Configure the Gateway for table and streams replication.
       See [5]Configuring Gateways for Table and Stream Replication for
       more information.
    5. Perform the steps to [6]verify configuration for replication.

   You can now set up volumes on the source cluster to push data to
   replicas on the destination cluster. However, you cannot create
   replicas on the source cluster that get data from volumes in the
   destination cluster because the setup described above is
   unidirectional. To configure the clusters for bidirectional
   replication, repeat the steps above by switching the source and
   destination clusters.

   For example, suppose there are two clusters, clusterA and clusterB, and
   you performed the steps above for clusterA as the source cluster and
   clusterB as the destination cluster. After you complete the steps
   above, your source cluster, clusterA can push data to replicas on
   clusterB. For clusterB to replicate data on clusterA, perform the steps
   above with clusterB as the source cluster, and clusterA as the
   destination cluster.

Verifying Cross-Cluster Configuration for Mirroring and Replication

   You can verify the cross-cluster configuration for:
    1. Mirroring by logging in to a node on the destination cluster as the
       user for whom access was configured, and creating a mirror volume
       on the destination cluster for a volume on the source cluster.
       You can create mirror volumes using [7]MCS and/or the [8]CLI.
    2. Replication by logging in to a node on the source cluster as the
       user for whom access was configured and creating a replica in the
       destination cluster for a volume, table, and stream on the source
       cluster.
       You can create replicas using MCS and the CLI. To set up
       replication on secure clusters for:
          + Tables, refer to the documentation for [9]MCS and/or the
            [10]CLI.
          + Streams, refer to the documentation for [11]MCS and/or the
            [12]CLI.
