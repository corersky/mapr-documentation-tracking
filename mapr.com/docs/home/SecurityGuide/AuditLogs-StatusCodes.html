Status Codes That Can Appear in Audit Logs

   In the status field in entries in audit logs, numeric codes other than
   0 for success can appear. For the list of possible codes, their keyword
   equivalents, and descriptions, refer to the standard Linux errno-base.h
   and errno.h files. The authaudit.log.json file contains HTTP status
   codes. See [1]HTTP Status Codes for more information.
