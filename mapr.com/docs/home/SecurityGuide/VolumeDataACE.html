Managing Whole Volume ACEs

   You can grant permissions (using ACEs) to users, groups, and roles for
   the volume data using whole volume ACEs. Whole volume ACEs allow you to
   define whitelists, to grant access, and blacklists, to deny access, for
   files and tables within a volume.

   Volume administrators and mapr user can set and modify whole volume
   ACEs. By default, ACEs grant everyone access to read and write to files
   and tables in the volume at the volume-level; however, inside the
   volume, to determine access for:
     * Files, the file ACEs or POSIX mode bits are used.
     * Tables, the table ACEs are used.

Supported Access Types

   At the volume level, the following access types are supported:

   CAPTION:

   Access Type Description
   -readAce Read files, MapR Database binary tables, MapR Database JSON
   tables, and MapR streams in the volume. By default, this is set to p to
   grant all users this permission.
   -writeAce Write to files, MapR Database binary tables, MapR Database
   JSON tables, and MapR streams in the volume. By default, this is set to
   p to grant all users this permission.

ACE Behavior on Snapshots and Mirrors

   Volume Snapshots

   Volume snapshots reflect the ACEs of the volume at that point in time.
   Changes in volume ACEs:
     * Are carried over to a new snapshot of the volume.
     * Do not propagate to older snapshots of the volume.

   Volume Mirrors

   ACEs of a volume are propagated to mirror volumes. After each mirroring
   operation, mirror volumes reflect the current ACE setting of their
   source volume. After a mirror volume is promoted to a read-write
   volume, you can modify the ACEs on the mirror volume from the command
   line. ACEs on the promoted mirror volume can be different from the
   source volume.
