Generating a MapR User Ticket

   A user ticket file is stored in /tmp and can only be read by that user.
   To generate a MapR user ticket, run the following command:
maprlogin password

   This command prompts for the user's password, then generates a mapr
   user ticket associated with the UNIX user ID. By default, tickets on
   Linux systems are generated in the /tmp directory and are named in the
   form maprticket_<UID> . Tickets on Windows systems are generated in the
   %TEMP%/ directory and are named in the form maprticket_<username> . To
   change the default location, change the value of the
   MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION environment variable.
   Note: The mapr user can impersonate any user, including user root.
   Note: There are no notifications to indicate that a ticket is about to
   expire. Use the maprlogin print command, with the ticket file, to see
   when the ticket expires. You can renew the ticket until the renewal
   date mentioned.

   To illustrate a typical work flow, suppose a user wants to access two
   clusters, cluster1 and cluster2. During this session, a user logs in as
   root to cluster1, gets a MapR user ticket, and displays the ticket
   contents with the maprlogin print command.
root@qa-node113:~/SecurityInstall# maprlogin password
[Password for user 'root' at cluster 'cluster1': ]
MapR credentials of user 'root' for cluster 'cluster1' are written to '/tmp/mapr
ticket_0'
root@qa-node113:~/SecurityInstall#

First Ticket for Cluster 1

root@qa-node113:~/SecurityInstall# maprlogin print
Opening keyfile /tmp/maprticket_0
qasecurity1: user = root, created = 'Wed Sep 11 14:19:02 PDT 2013', expires = 'W
ed Sep 25 14:19:02 PDT 2013', RenewalTill = 'Fri Oct 11 14:19:02 PDT 2013', uid
= 0, gids = 0, 42
root@qa-node113:~/SecurityInstall#

   Now the root user logs in to cluster2. The maprlogin command returns a
   ticket for cluster2. This ticket is stored in the common ticket file.
   Commands now have access to both tickets.
root@qa-node113:/opt/mapr/conf# maprlogin password -cluster cluster2
[Password for user 'root' at cluster 'cluster2': ]
MapR credentials of user 'root' for cluster 'cluster2' are written to '/tmp/mapr
ticket_0'

Showing Tickets for both Clusters

qasecurity2: user = root, created = 'Thu Sep 12 15:20:49 PDT 2013', expires = 'T
