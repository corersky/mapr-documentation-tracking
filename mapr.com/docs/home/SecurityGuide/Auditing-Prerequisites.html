Managing Auditing

   Provides instructions for using MapR auditing features.

   You can enable auditing of cluster administration and data-access
   operations using the MapR Control System and the CLI. Enabling auditing
   of filesystem, table, and streams operations requires running a command
   on a cluster, a command on individual volumes in the cluster, and a
   command on individual directories, files, and MapR Database tables and
   streams within those volumes.

   These steps are summarized in the following table:

   Prerequisites for enabling auditing
     * If you upgraded your MapR cluster from version 4.1 or earlier, you
       must enable the auditing feature.
          + Run maprcli config save -values
            {"mfs.feature.audit.support":"1"}
          + To verify that the feature is enabled, run maprcli config load
            -json | grep "mfs.feature.audit.support"
     * Only the root user or mapr user can enable or disable auditing.
