Custom Security in MapR

   Describes the .customSecure file and how MapR 6.x handles custom
   security settings.
   This topic contains the following subsections:
     * [1]What is Custom Security?
     * [2]Identifying the Current Security State of the Cluster
     * [3]About the .customSecure File
     * [4]Forcing a Change to the Security Configuration

     * [7]Adding a Service to a Cluster with Custom Security

   Note: Implementing custom security is not recommended unless your
   installation demands it. Using the custom security option means that
   MapR software does not ensure that your system is secure by default,
   and all security configuration must be done manually by you.

   In MapR 6.x, the [8]configure.sh script detects that a cluster is in
   one of three security states:
   Secure The cluster is configured with the default MapR security
   settings.
   Unsecure No security settings are configured for the cluster.
   Custom secure The cluster has a mixture of MapR security settings and
   custom settings.

   Understanding how configure.sh handles custom security settings is
   important when you upgrade a cluster, add services, add nodes, or
   change security settings.

What is Custom Security?

   Any change to the default MapR configuration for authentication,
   authorization, or encryption represents a "custom security" change.
   Users who make such changes are encouraged to create a .customSecure
   file to ensure that configure.sh does not remove these changes. Custom
   security changes include any change to the keystore or trustore
   paswords or the number of keys in those files or the names of the keys.
   Other examples of custom security changes include:
     * Implementing Kerberos security
     * Changing the Hive authorization model
     * Changing the Oozie authorization model

Identifying the Current Security State of the Cluster

   If the current security state of the cluster (secure, unsecure, or
   custom secure) is unknown, you can use one of these checks to identify
   which state the cluster is in:
     * Check the security value in the /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf
       file. For example:
<clustername1> secure=true <CLDB> <CLDB> â€¦ <CLDB>
       For more information, see [9]mapr-clusters.conf.
     * Check for the presence of the .customSecure file:
/opt/mapr/conf/.customSecure
       If the file is present, configure.sh treats the cluster as custom
       secure.

About the .customSecure File

   If you customized the security settings for your cluster and you want
   to ensure that configure.sh does not change any of the settings, you
   can create a .customSecure file. The file must be created in the
   following location on every node:
/opt/mapr/conf/.customSecure

   The .customSecure file does not contain any information. The presence
   of the file tells configure.sh that the cluster has security settings
   that must not be changed by configure.sh.

   Typically, you create the .customSecure file manually. However, in some
   cases, configure.sh creates or removes the .customSecure file for you.
   For example, if configure.sh detects that it is being run after an
   upgrade from a MapR 5.x secure cluster, it creates the .customSecure
   file automatically. If you use the -forceSecurityDefaults option and
   -secure or -unsecure with configure.sh, the script removes the
   .customSecure file because you are forcing the removal of custom
   security settings.

Forcing a Change to the Security Configuration

   If your MapR 6.x cluster has custom security settings (the
   .customSecure file is present), and you want to change to the default
   MapR secure or non-secure settings, you can use the
   -forceSecurityDefaults option of configure.sh to make the change. Note
   these considerations:
     * Using the -forceSecurityDefaults option removes the .customSecure
       file. Note that you must specify the -secure or -unsecure option
       with -forceSecurityDefaults. Otherwise, the command will have no
       effect.
     * The -forceSecurityDefaults option might not remove all of your
       custom settings. Some manual editing might be necessary to return
       the cluster to a usable state.
     * When forcing a custom-secured cluster to be MapR secure, you still
       need to include other configure.sh options that are required for
       security. And you need to perform any steps required to add
       security. For example, see [10]Enabling Wire-level Security.

Custom Security and the MapR Installer

   Using the MapR Installer or MapR Installer Stanzas is not supported on
   clusters with custom security or customized configurations.

Adding a Node to a Cluster with Custom Security

   Adding a node to a cluster with custom security is similar to adding a
   node to a cluster with MapR security, but there are some additional
   steps:
    1. Add the node with default MapR security as described in [11]Adding
       Nodes to a Cluster.
    2. To support your custom security mode, copy any custom resources or
       settings as needed from existing nodes to the added node.
    3. Create the /opt/mapr/conf/.customSecure file on the added node:
/usr/bin/touch /opt/mapr/conf/.customSecure

Adding a Service to a Cluster with Custom Security

   If you add a new service (ecosystem component) to a secure or
   custom-secure cluster, configure.sh configures the service for MapR
   security automatically. If the cluster is custom secure, you need to
   change the security settings for the service to be compatible with the
   current cluster settings and restart the service. Any subsequent use of
   configure.sh -R will leave the customization in place.
