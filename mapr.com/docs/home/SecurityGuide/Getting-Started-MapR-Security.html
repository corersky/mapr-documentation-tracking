Getting Started with MapR Security

   Describes quick implementation of security.

   MapR 6.1 introduces enhanced security settings that simplify the
   process of creating secure clusters. For a brief introduction, see
   [1]Security.

   To set up a secure cluster:
    1. Enable cluster security, authentication, and wire-level encryption
       by running configure.sh if you performed a manual installation.
       See [2]Enabling Security for more information.
       Note: If you selected the [3]security option when installing with
       the [4]MapR Installer, you can proceed to the next step.
    2. Generate MapR user tickets to authenticate with your username and
       password.
       See [5]Generating a MapR User Ticket for more information.
    3. Configure each Ecosystem component, where necessary, for security.
       See [6]Security and Ecosystem Components for more information.
    4. (Optional) Enable encryption of data at rest at the cluster level
       and selectively for volumes as well.
       See [7]Enabling Encryption of Data at Rest for more information.
    5. (Optional) Turn on auditing for the cluster and for directories
       that contain sensitive data.
       See [8]Enabling and Disabling Auditing of Cluster Administration
       and [9]Enabling and Disabling Auditing of Data Access Operations
       for more information.
    6. (Optional) Enable authorization using ACEs for files, tables,
       streams, or volumes and ACLs for administrative activities that can
       be performed on the cluster.
       See [10]Managing Access Control Expressions and [11]Managing Access
       Control Lists for more information.

   Tip: After you enable security, review the [12]System Behavior Changes
   After Enabling Security.
