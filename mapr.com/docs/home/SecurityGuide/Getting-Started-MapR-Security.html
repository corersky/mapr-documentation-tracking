Getting Started with MapR Security

   Describes two core scenarios that allow quick implementation of
   security features.

   MapR 6.0 introduced enhanced security settings that simplify the
   process of creating secure clusters. For a brief intro, see [1]Built-in
   Security in MapR.

   To set up an initial secure cluster for MapR Core using minimal
   security:
    1. Enable wire-level security by running configure.sh.
       See [2]Enabling Wire-level Security.
    2. Generate MapR user tickets to authenticate with your username and
       password.
       See the maprlogin password command in [3]Generating a MapR User
       Ticket.
    3. Decide which Ecosystem components to secure and with which
       authentication method.
       See the [4]MapR Security Support Matrix.
    4. Configure each Ecosystem component with the appropriate
       authentication method.
       See the sections for individual Ecosystem components in the
       [5]Ecosystem Components.
    5. (Optional) Turn on auditing for directories that contain sensitive
       data.
    6. (Optional) Enable authorization using ACEs for files, tables,
       streams, or volumes and ACLs for administrative activities that can
       be performed on the cluster.
    7. (Optional) Enable impersonation.

   Note: If you wish to implement Ecosystem compenent security, see the
   sections for individual Ecosystem components in the [6]Ecosystem
   Components and the [7]MapR Security Support Matrix.
