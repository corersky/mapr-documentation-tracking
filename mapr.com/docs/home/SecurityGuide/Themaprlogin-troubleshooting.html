Troubleshooting maprlogin Failures

   While the root causes of most failure cases with maprlogin can be
   quickly diagnosed, the following cases can prove challenging:
     * When security is enabled for a cluster, the cluster's CLDB listens
       for connections on port 7443. If security for the cluster is
       disabled, the maprlogin utility is unable to reach the CLDB.
     * The utility's connection uses HTTPS, which requires the file
       [1]conf/ssl_truststore to exist on the client. If the file is not
       present, a secure connection cannot be negotiated.

   Detailed error logs for maprlogin connection attempts are kept at
   logs/maprlogin-<USERID>-nnnn.log.
