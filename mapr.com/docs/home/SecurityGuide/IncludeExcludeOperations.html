Including and/or Excluding Operations

   Including or excluding specific operations from auditing requires
   running the [1]maprcli command.

Include or Exclude Operations During Volume Creation

   During volume creation, the specified list of operations must either be
   included for auditing or excluded from auditing. You cannot specify a
   mixed list of included and excluded operations.

   By default, all other operations other than the specified operations
   are:
     * Included for auditing if the specified list is a list of excluded
       operations.
     * Excluded from auditing if the specified list is a list of included
       operations.

   Examples
   The following example shows how to enable auditing and exclude specific
   operations (such as lookup, read, and write) from auditing:
maprcli volume create -name test-volume -path /test/test-volume -auditenabled tr
ue -dataauditops --lookup,-read,-write

   In the above example, operations other than the ones specified are
   included for auditing.
   The following example shows how to include all operations except lookup
   for auditing:
maprcli volume create -name test-volume -path /test/test-volume -dataauditops --
lookup

   The following example shows how to include only chown operation for
   auditing and exclude all other operations from auditing:
maprcli volume create -name test-volume -path /test/test-volume -dataauditops +c
hown

Include and Exclude Operations After Volume Creation

   After volume creation, you can include and exclude certain operations
   from auditing using the [2]volume modify or [3]volume audit command.
   When you modify a volume (by running the volume modify command) or when
   you enable volume auditing (by running the volume audit command), you
   can specify a mixed list of included and excluded operations. There are
   no changes to operations that are not specified with the command.

   For the list of operations that can be included and/or excluded from
   auditing, see [4]Auditing of Filesystem Operations and Table
   Operations.

   Examples
   The following example shows how to include create operation for
   auditing and exclude lookup operation from auditing:
maprcli volume modify -name test-volume -dataauditops +create,-lookup

   The following example shows how to include all operations except lookup
   for auditing:
maprcli volume audit -name test-volume -dataauditops +all,-lookup
