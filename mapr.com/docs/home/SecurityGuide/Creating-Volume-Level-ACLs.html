Creating Volume-level ACLs

   MapR provides volumes as a way to organize data and manage cluster
   performance. For example, you might want to create a volume for each
   user, department, or project. You can then create a volume-level ACL
   that controls which users and groups have access to that volume, and
   what actions they may perform.

   You can create volume-level ACLs from the MapR Control System (MCS) or
   from the command line.

Creating Volume-level ACLs from the MCS

   For:
     * New volumes, see [1]Creating a Volume to set volume-level ACLs.
     * Existing volumes, see [2]Modifying a Volume to modify volume-level
       ACLs.

Creating Volume-level ACLs from the Command Line

   To create an ACL at the command line, use the [3]acl set command to
   specify a list of authorized users (or groups) and the actions they are
   allowed to perform.

   The syntax is:
maprcli acl set -type volume -name <volume name> [-user <username>:<action> -gro
up <groupname>:<action>]

   Include spaces between multiple entries, such as a list of usernames
   and their associated permission levels (or actions). Each allowed
   action has a permission code associated with it. The codes are
   explained below.

   CAPTION:

   Permission Code Allowed Action
   dump Dump or back up the volume
   restore Restore or mirror the volume
   m Modify the volume's properties
   d Delete the volume
   a Administrator (can edit and view ACLs, but cannot perform volume
   operations)
   fc Full control over the volume (this enables all volume-related
   administrative options with the exception of changing the volume ACLs)

Example

   This example shows how to create an ACL for a volume named test-volume
   that allows full control over volume ACLs for user rjones. In addition,
   all users in the developers group are given permission to dump,
   restore, and modify volume properties.
maprcli acl set -type volume -name test-volume -user rjones:fc
-group developers:dump,restore,m
