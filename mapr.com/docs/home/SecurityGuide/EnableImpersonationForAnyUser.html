Enabling Impersonation for any User

   Provides a procedure necessary to implement impersonation for any MapR
   user.

   To enable impersonation for any MapR user:
    1. Log in to the system as root, mapr user, or any user with full
       control.
    2. Generate a servicewithimpersonation ticket for the MapR user.
       For example:
$ maprlogin generateticket -type servicewithimpersonation -user mapruser1 -out /
var/tmp/sample_ticket
       Warning: The mapr user ticket can be used to impersonate any user,
       including user root.
       You can generate a scoped servicewithimpersonation ticket for the
       user. The scoped impersonation tickets allows the user using the
       ticket to impersonate only the UIDs and or GIDs specified in the
       ticket. For example:
$ maprlogin generateticket -type servicewithimpersonation -user mapruser1 -imper
sonateduids 550 impersonatedgid 500 -out /var/tmp/sample_ticket
       Note: When generating a scoped impersonation ticket, the
       impersonated UIDs cannot contain the UID of user root or user mapr
       and the impersonated GIDs cannot contain the GID of user root or
       user mapr.
       For more information, see [1]maprlogin.
    3. Move the ticket to a secure location and share the ticket with the
       user (for whom this ticket was generated).
    4. (Optional) Copy the file to a permanent directory.
