System Behavior Changes After Enabling Security

   After enabling security features for your cluster, the following
   behaviors change:
     * Users must authenticate with the [1]maprlogin utility.
     * Components that have web UIs, such as the MapR Control System
       (MCS), Hive, and Oozie, require authentication.
       Warning: Note that you must also complete the [2]PAM configuration
       to set up user authentication for MCS logins.
     * Several components that communicate over HTTP use HTTPS instead.
     * Encryption is used for network traffic.
     * Access to a cluster using URIs that use the CLDB node's name or IP
       address, instead of the cluster name, is no longer supported, as in
       the following examples. The following URIs no longer work after
       enabling security:
http://cldb1.cluster.com:7222/f1
http://10.10.20.10:7221/f1
       The following URIs work after enabling security:
http:///f1 <access f1 in default cluster>
http://my.cluster.com/f1
