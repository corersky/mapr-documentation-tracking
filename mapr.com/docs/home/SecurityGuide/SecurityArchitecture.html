Security Architecture

   Describes how the design of the MapR security architecture takes into
   account the main threats to a secure cluster. By default, MapR provides
   basic authorization functionality and some authentication.
     * [1]Filesystem permissions: MapR-FS is a POSIX-like file system. You
       can set user permissions as you would on any other Linux system.
     * [2]Cluster, [3]volume, and [4]job queue Access Control Lists
       (ACLs): You can specify the actions that a given user can perform
       on each of these cluster elements.
     * [5]Access Control Expressions for filesystem and natively stored
       MapR-DB tables. ACEs control which files, directories, volumes,
       streams, and tables users or groups can access.
     * Username/password login authentication to the MapR Control System
       (MCS) through Pluggable Access Modules (PAM). You can use any
       registry that has a PAM module.

   Wire-level security (WLS) is disabled by default. When WLS is enabled,
   MapR upgrades its security to use network-safe authentication and
   encryption:
     * Communication between the nodes in the cluster is authenticated and
       may be encrypted:
          + Traffic between the server and cluster, traffic within the
            MapR filesystem, and CLDB traffic is authenticated using
            network-safe tokens and may be encrypted with secure MapR
            RPCs.
          + Traffic between JobClients, NodeManagers, and ResourceManagers
            is secured with MAPRSASL, an implementation of the [6]Simple
            Authentication and Security Layer framework.

     * Support for [7]Kerberos user authentication.
     * Support for Kerberos encryption for secure communication to open
       source components that require it.
     * Support for the Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism
       ([8]SPNEGO) used with the web UI frontends of some cluster
       components.

   Clusters with different security profiles, and client machines outside
   of the cluster's security realm, can communicate with the secure
   cluster.
