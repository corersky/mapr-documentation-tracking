Accessing External HDFS Clusters

   Outlines how to use protocols to connect to other clusters.

   MapR clusters can access an external HDFS cluster with the webhdfs://
   protocols.

Prerequisites

   Before you begin, verify the following:
     * The MapR node accessing the HDFS cluster must have the mapr-core or
       mapr-client package installed.
     * The HDFS cluster is installed and configured according to the
       vendor's specifications.
     * To use the hdfs:// protocol, edit the fs.hdfs.impl property in the
       $HADOOP_HOME/conf/[1]core-site.xml file to include the value
       org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem.

   See the following cases provide information about MapR and accessing
   HDFS clusters.
