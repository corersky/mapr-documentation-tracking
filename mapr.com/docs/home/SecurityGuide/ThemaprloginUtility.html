maprlogin

   The /opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin command line tool enables users to log into
   secure MapR clusters. Users authenticate themselves to the cluster with
   a [1]maprticket that can be generated in the following ways:
     * Run maprlogin password to authenticate with username and password.
     * Run maprlogin generateticket to request a service, tenant, or
       cross-cluster ticket for use by an external application or user
       account (based on the current user's ticket).
     * Run maprlogin kerberos after generating a Kerberos ticket with the
       kinit command.

   Note: Tickets contain keys, and are used to authenticate users and MapR
   servers. Every user who wants to access a cluster must have a MapR user
   ticket (maprticket_<uid>) and every node in the cluster must have a
   MapR server ticket (maprserverticket).

   For more details about different ways to generate tickets, see
   [2]Tickets.

Arguments

   Argument

   Description
   authtest Simulates runtime behavior during authentication. The
   following is the syntax for running the maprlogin command with this
   argument:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin password
     [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
     [ -user <UNIX user name> ]
     [ -duration <ticket duration in seconds> ]
     [ -out <ticket location> ]

   For more information, see [3]Options.
   end|logout Logs out of the cluster. The following is the syntax for
   running the maprlogin command with this argument:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin end|logout
     [ -cluster mapr cluster name ]

   For more information, see [4]Options.
   generateticket Generates a ticket for another user or application. The
   user who runs the maprlogin command with this option must already have
   a user ticket and must have fc (full control) ACL authorization on the
   cluster. See [5]acl set.

   The following is the syntax for running the maprlogin command with this
   argument:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin generateticket
        -type service|crosscluster|servicewithimpersonation|tenant
        -user <UNIX user name>
        [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
        -out <ticket location>
        [ -duration <[Days:]Hours:Minutes OR -duration Seconds> ]
        [ -renewal <[Days:]Hours:Minutes OR -duration Seconds> ]
        [ -impersonateduids <uids to impersonate> ]
        [ -impersonatedgids <gids to impersonate> ]

   For more information, see [6]Options.
   kerberos Indicates the presence of a Kerberos ticket. The following is
   the syntax for running the maprlogin command with this argument:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin kerberos
        [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
        [ -duration <ticket duration> ]

   For more information, see [7]Options.
   password The user's UNIX password. The following is the syntax for
   running the maprlogin command with this argument:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin password
        [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
        [ -user <user name> ]
        [ -duration <ticket duration> ]
        [ -out <ticket location> ]

   For more information, see [8]Options.
   print Prints ticket of any type and contains information including the
   cluster name, the user ID, the date when the ticket was created, the
   ticket expiration date, and whether user can impersonate other users,
   and whether the ticket is for a tenant.

   In the service tickets, the value for CanImpersonate is true if
   impersonation is enabled for user and false if impersonation is
   disabled for the user. In the regular cluster ticket for the user, the
   value of CanImpersonate is always false. In the tenant ticket, the
   value for CanImpersonate is always true.

   The following is the syntax for running the maprlogin command with this
   argument:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin print
      [ -ticketfile <location of ticket file> ]

   For more information, see [9]Options.
   renew Renews the ticket, given a duration that does not cause the
   ticket to exceed its maximum lifetime. The original -renewal value for
   the ticket determines its maximum lifetime. The following is the syntax
   for running the maprlogin command with this argument:
/opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin renew
        [ -cluster <cluster name> ]
        [ -duration <ticket renew duration> ]
        [ -ticketfile <input ticket file> ]
        [ -out <ticket location> ]

   For more information, see [10]Options.

Options

   Option

   Description

   Default
   -cluster Name of the cluster to log into. First cluster name in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file.
   -duration Length of time before the ticket expires, specified in one of
   the following formats:

   -duration [Days:]Hours:Minutes

   - duration Seconds

   Password-generated tickets are bounded by the CLDB duration and renewal
   properties that are set for the cluster:
     * cldb.security.user.ticket.duration.seconds (default=1209600) is
       used if duration is not specified while generating the ticket.
     * cldb.security.user.ticket.max.duration.seconds (default=2592000) is
       the maximum duration allowed for a ticket.

   For password-generated tickets, if -duration is not set with the
   maprlogin command, the CLDB duration property is used by default.

   See [11]config.
   Note: The service, servicewithimpersonation, tenant, and crosscluster
   tickets may have a very long lifetime; their duration is not bounded by
   these properties. For service and crosscluster tickets, the default
   value is LIFETIME.
     * 1209600 seconds (14 days) for user tickets
     * LIFETIME for service and cross-cluster tickets

   -impersonatedgids The comma-separated list of GIDs to impersonate. This
   can only be specified when generating a servicewithimpersonation
   ticket. If this is specified, the ticket owner can only impersonate the
   specified groups or users belonging to the specified groups.

   If impersonatedgids and impersonareduids are not specified, the ticket
   holder can impersonate all users on the cluster.
   No default
   -impersonateduids The comma-separated list of UIDs to impersonate. This
   can only be specified when generating a servicewithimpersonation
   ticket. If this is specified, the ticket owner can only impersonate the
   specified users.

   If impersonatedgids and impersonareduids are not specified, the ticket
   holder can impersonate all users on the cluster.
   No default
   -out A safe directory location where the ticket will be stored. Can be
   used with generateticket, password, and renew commands.

   You must specify a location when generating service and tenant tickets.
   (This requirement ensures that other tickets are not overwritten.)
   /tmp/maprticket_<uid>

   (default applies to non-service tickets only)
   -renewal Total lifetime of the ticket, specified in one of the
   following formats:

   -renewal [Days:]Hours:Minutes

   -renewal Seconds

   If -renewal is not set with the maprlogin command, the CLDB renewal
   property is set by default
   (cldb.security.user.ticket.renew.duration.seconds). You can also set
   the cldb.security.user.ticket.renew.max.duration.seconds property,
   which is the maximum duration (7776000, by default) allowed for a
   ticket renewal.
   Note: Service, tenant, and crosscluster tickets are not bounded by
   these properties.

   For example, assume that the maprlogin command passes the following
   options for a service ticket:

   -duration 30:0:0 -renewal 90:0:0

   The ticket will expire after 30 days unless it is renewed. If a
   maprlogin renew command is submitted for the ticket before the initial
   30 days pass, the ticket's lifetime may be extended up to a total
   maximum lifetime of 90 days. Tickets do not renew automatically;
   administrators must renew them with the maprlogin renew command,
   specifying a valid renewal period, and they must do this before the
   duration period ends. The renewal period must be less than or equal to
   the remaining amount of time allowed on the ticket.

   Using the same example, if you renew a ticket on the 29th day of its
   life, you can renew it for up to 61 days. You can renew a ticket
   incrementally, for some number of days at a time, as long as you do not
   exceed the original renewal value.
   2592000 seconds (30 days)
   -ticketfile Optional with print and renew commands. Specifies the path
   to ticket file, if different from default. If this is not specified,
   the command looks for the ticketfile (maprticket_<uid>) in the default
   location, which is /tmp on Linux and %TEMP% on Windows systems or in
   the location specified by the environment variable,
   $MAPR_TICKETFILE_LOCATION.
     * Linux: /tmp
     * Windows: %TEMP%

   -type Required ticket type for the generateticket command; value must
   be service, servicewithimpersonation, tenant, or crosscluster:
     * service is used to generate service tickets for regular cluster
       operations.
     * servicewithimpersonation is used to generate tickets for regular
       cluster operations, including allowing user to impersonate other
       users (except the mapr user).
     * tenant is used to generate tickets for tenant users/hosts.
     * crosscluster is used to generate tickets for inter-cluster
       operations, such as remote mirroring. The crosscluster option only
       works with the mapr user.

   No default; -type must be set in the maprlogin generateticket command.
   -user Required with the generateticket command. The UNIX user name of
   the user on the MapR cluster.

   For crosscluster tickets, the user must be mapr.
   No default
