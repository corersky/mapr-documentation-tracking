Setting Whole Volume ACEs

   You can set ACEs at the time of volume creation using the [1]volume
   create command and set/modify them at a later time using the [2]volume
   modify command. When you run the command to set or modify ACEs, the
   command will:
     * Overwrite existing values with new values, if specified, for access
       types that were previously set.
     * Set values for access types that have not yet been set, if
       specified.
     * Not modify access types that were not specified with the command,
       whether they were previously set or are unset.

   When you set whole volume ACEs, permissions on files and tables under
   that volume remain unchanged. Also, new files and tables in the volume
   will not inherit the whole volume ACEs of that volume. Instead, whole
   volume ACEs, if set, will be used to determine volume level access to
   tables and files within the volume. To gain access to volume data, user
   must have access at both the volume and file/table levels.

Whole Volume ACE Example

   For example, suppose the following sequence of whole volume ACE
   settings for users u3 and u4.
   Note: In the following illustration, default ACE values are shown in
   red.

   As shown in the illustration above, in:

   Step 1:
          User u3 is granted permissions to read.

          User u3: User u3 has permissions to read files and tables at the
          volume level and by default, user u3 has write permission (shown
          in red) at the volume level. However, for:

          + Files in the volume, file ACE or POSIX mode bits will be used
            to determine read and write access for user u3.
          + Tables in the volume, table ACEs will be used to determine
            read and write access for user u3.

          User u4: User u4 cannot read files and tables within the volume
          because the ACE for the volume does not explicitly grant access
          to user u4 and although user u4 has write permission by default,
          user u4 cannot write to files/tables in the volume because user
          u4 does not have read permission.

   Step 2:
          User u3 is granted permissions to write.

          User u3: User u3’s read access remains unchanged and although
          user u3 has permissions to write to files and tables, for:

          + Files in the volume, file ACE or POSIX mode bits will be used
            to determine write access for user u3.
          + Tables in the volume, table ACEs will be used to determine
            write access for user u3.

          User u4: User u4 cannot write to files/tables in the volume.

   Step 3
          User u4 is granted read access.

          User u3: User u3’s read and write access remains unchanged.

          User u4: User u4 has permissions to read files and tables at the
          volume-level; however, for:

          + Files in the volume, file ACE or POSIX mode bits will be used
            to determine read access for user u4.
          + Tables in the volume, table ACEs will be used to determine
            read access for user u4.
