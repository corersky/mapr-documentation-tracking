Encryption in MapR

   MapR encryption restricts an external party's ability to read or modify
   data.

   Data transmission between nodes in a secure MapR cluster is encrypted,
   preventing an attacker with access to that communication from gaining
   information about the transmission's contents.

   MapR uses several technologies to protect network traffic:
     * The Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
       protocol secures several channels of HTTP traffic.
     * In compliance with the NIST standard, the Advanced Encryption
       Standard in[1] Galois/Counter Mode (AES/GCM) secures several
       communication channels between cluster components.
     * Kerberos encryption secures several communication paths elsewhere
       in the cluster.

   The [2]Security Protocols Used by MapR section includes details on the
   specific technologies used by particular elements of a cluster.

   Nodes with CPUs that support AES encryption at the hardware level
   provide superior performance on encryption tasks. You can determine if
   a node's CPU supports the AES instruction set by running the following
   command:
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | grep aes
