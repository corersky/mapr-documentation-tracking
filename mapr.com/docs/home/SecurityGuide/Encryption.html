Encryption in MapR

   Describes encryption types available on the MapR Data Platform.

   MapR encryption restricts an external party's ability to read or modify
   data.

   MapR supports encryption of data on wire and data at rest for
   preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. These encryption
   methods are in addition to authentication and authorization
   protections. Encryption can be used to avoid exposure to breaches such
   as packet sniffing and theft of storage devices.

   Data transmission between nodes in a secure MapR cluster is encrypted,
   preventing an attacker with access to that communication from gaining
   information about the contents of the transmission. Encryption of
   data-at-rest prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data
   and protects against data theft through sector-level disk access.

On-Wire Encryption

   Data transmission between nodes in a secure MapR cluster over any
   network connection supported by MapR is encrypted. When you run the
   [1]configure.sh utility with the -secure option, you are enabling the
   cluster for security, authentication, and wire-level encryption for the
   platform and all ecosystem components. In secure mode, MapR
   automatically encrypts all data traffic. Enabling encryption ensures
   that data to and from the locations you specify is encrypted as it
   travels over the network.

   MapR uses the following technologies to protect network traffic:
     * The Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
       protocol secures several channels of HTTP traffic supporting TLS
       1.0, 1.1, which is the default, and 1.2.
     * In compliance with the NIST standard, the 256-bit Advanced
       Encryption Standard in [2]Galois/Counter Mode (AES256/GCM) secures
       several communication channels between cluster components.

   The information in [3]Security Protocols Used by MapR includes details
   on the specific technologies used by particular elements of a cluster.

   Nodes with CPUs that support AES encryption at the hardware level
   provide superior performance on encryption tasks. You can determine if
   the CPU of a node supports the AES instruction set by running the
   following command:
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | grep aes

Data-at-Rest Encryption

   Data on disk (or data-at-rest) in a secure MapR cluster can be
   encrypted, enabling you to protect the data if a disk is compromised.
   Encryption of data-at-rest not only prevents unauthorized users from
   accessing sensitive data, but it also protects against data theft via
   sector-level disk access. When you run the [4]configure.sh utility with
   the -dare option, you are enabling data at rest encryption feature at
   the cluster level. If encryption of data at rest is enabled, new
   volumes are encrypted by default with the option to create a volume
   without encryption. For example, if you have a volume that contains
   data that is not at all sensitive, you might not want to encrypt it.
   For encrypted volumes, MapR automatically encrypts data at rest and
   manages the keys used to encrypt data seamlessly; you do not need
   special utilities to encrypt or decrypt the data. MapR uses AES256/XTS
   to protect data on the disk.
