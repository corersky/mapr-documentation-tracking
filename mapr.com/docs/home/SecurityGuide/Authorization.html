Authorization in MapR

   Describes the basics of authorization including Access Control Lists
   and Access Control Expressions.

   Authorization restricts what an authenticated user can do with data.
   MapR enables you to create flexible authorization systems that grant a
   user capabilities to perform desired tasks, but prevents the user from
   performing tasks outside of that scope. Use a combination of Access
   Control Lists and Access Control Expressions to set up a flexible
   authorization system.

   Access Control Lists
          MapR supports [1]Access Control Lists (ACLs) in several areas,
          including for regulating user privileges to the job queue and
          cluster. MapR also uses ACLs to control administrative access to
          volumes (administrative access is distinct from data access).

          An Access Control List (ACL) is a list of users or groups. Each
          user or group in the list is paired with a defined set of
          permissions that limit the actions that the user or group can
          perform on the object secured by the ACL. In MapR, the objects
          secured by ACLs are the job queue, volumes, and the cluster
          itself.

          A job queue ACL controls who can submit jobs to a queue, kill
          jobs, or modify their priority. A volume-level ACL controls
          which users and groups have administrative access to that
          volume, and what actions they may perform, such as mirroring the
          volume, altering the volume properties, dumping or backing up
          the volume, or deleting the volume.

   Access Control Expressions
          MapR also provides a more powerful authorization known as
          [2]Access Control Expressions. ACEs allow you to control access
          using powerful boolean logic expressions. You can use ACEs to
          control data access to MapR tables, files, directories, volumes,
          and streams. The MapR Filesystem also supports standard POSIX
          [3]filesystem permission levels.

          An ACE is a combination of user, group, and role definitions. A
          role is a custom defined name that is determined and implemented
          by your custom authorization code. It can be a property of a
          user or group that defines a set of behaviors that the user or
          group performs regularly. You can use ACEs to secure [4]files,
          directories, volumes, [5]tables, and [6]streams that use native
          storage.

   See the [7]Configuring MapR Security section for information about the
   procedures for setting up and modifying ACLs and ACEs for the cluster,
   the volumes on the cluster, the job queue, the MapR file system, and
   the natively stored MapR tables and streams.
