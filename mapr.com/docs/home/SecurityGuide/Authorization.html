Authorization in MapR

   Authorization restricts an authenticated MapR user's capabilities on
   the system. Flexible authorization systems grant a user capabilities to
   perform desired tasks, but prevents the user from performing tasks
   outside of that scope.

   MapR supports Access Control Lists (ACLs) in a number of areas,
   including for regulating user privileges to the job queue and cluster.
   MapR also uses ACLs to control administrative access to volumes
   (administrative access is distinct from data access).

   MapR also provides a more powerful authorization model known as
   [1]Access Control Expressions. ACEs allow you to control access using
   powerful boolean logic expressions. ACEs can be used to control data
   access to MapR tables, files, directories, volumes, and streams. The
   MapR file system also supports standard POSIX [2]filesystem permission
   levels.

   The [3]Configuring MapR Security section contains procedures for
   setting up and modifying ACLs and ACEs for the cluster, the volumes on
   the cluster, the job queue, the MapR file system, and the natively
   stored MapR tables and streams.
