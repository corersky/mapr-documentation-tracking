Converting to Cluster Enabled for Data at Rest Encryption

   MapR's [1]data-at-rest encryption allows you to protect the data in the
   event a disk is compromised. Using the [2]MapR Installer, you can
   select the Enable MapR DARE option during an incremental install after
   upgrading. You can also convert a cluster not enabled for encryption at
   rest to a cluster enabled for encryption at rest from the command-line
   during a [3]Manual Rolling Upgrade Description or after an [4]Offline
   and Manual Upgrade Procedure.
   Note: Encryption of data at rest can only be enabled on a secure
   cluster.

   To convert:
    1. Perform the following steps on a CLDB node to generate the master
       key for encryption of data at rest:
         a. Stop Warden on a CLDB node by running the following command:
/bin/systemctl stop mapr-warden
         b. Install MapR v6.1 packages if this is a rolling upgrade.
            See [5]Upgrading MapR Core Without the MapR Installer. You can
            skip this step if you have already installed the MapR v6.1
            packages.
         c. Run the [6]configure.sh command as shown below:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -genkeys -nocerts -dare  -R
            When you run the [7]configure.sh command with the genkeys and
            dare options, a MasterKey file is generated and stored in
            /opt/mapr/conf/dare.master.key.
            Important: You must create a copy of this file in other
            location(s) for backup purposes. Loss of this key will result
            in loss of cluster.
         d. Start Warden by running the following command:
/bin/systemctl start mapr-warden
    2. Copy the data at rest encryption master key file (generated above)
       to the /opt/mapr/conf directory on all the other CLDB nodes on the
       cluster.
    3. Perform the following steps on all the nodes, one node at a time if
       you are doing a rolling upgrade, in the cluster:
         a. Stop Warden by running the following command:
/bin/systemctl stop mapr-warden
         b. Install MapR v6.1 packages if this is a rolling upgrade.
            See [8]Upgrading MapR Core Without the MapR Installer. You can
            skip this step if you have already installed the MapR v6.1
            packages.
         c. Run the [9]configure.sh command as shown below:
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -dare -R
         d. Start Warden by running the following command:
/bin/systemctl start mapr-warden
    4. Enable encryption of data at rest through the mfs.feature.dare
       property and optionally other features, if they are not yet
       enabled.
       See [10]Step 4: Enable New Features.
    5. Specify whether (1) or not (0) to convert all existing volumes not
       enabled for encryption of data at rest to volumes enabled for
       encryption of data at rest by setting the value for the
       cldb.enforce.old.volumes.dare property using the [11]config save
       command.
       By default, all existing volumes are converted to volumes enabled
       for data at rest encryption because the default value for
       cldb.enforce.old.volumes.dare property is 1. To not convert all
       existing volumes to volumes enabled for data at rest encryption,
       run the following command:
maprcli config save -values '{"cldb.enforce.old.volumes.dare":"0"}
    6. Format the storage pools (SPs) on the nodes for data at rest
       encryption, one node and one SP at a time. That is:
         a. Decommission the node.
            See [12]Decommissioning a Node for Enabling Encryption of Data
            at Rest for more information.
         b. Format the SPs on the node.
            See [13]Formatting a Storage Pool for Encryption of Data at
            Rest for more information.
         c. Move the node back to the original topology.
            See [14]Changing the Topology of one or more Nodes for more
            information.
    7. Enable encryption of data at rest at the cluster-level by running
       the following command:
maprcli config save -values '{"mfs.enforce.dare":"1"}'
    8. Verify that encryption of data at rest is enabled at the
       cluster-level by running the following command:
maprcli config load -json | grep dare
       Your output should look similar to the following:
"cldb.enforce.old.volumes.dare":"1",
"mapr.default.dare.alarm.pending":"0",
"mapr.volume.dare.default":"1",
"mfs.enforce.dare":"1",
"mfs.feature.dare":"1",

   Encryption of data at rest is enabled by default for all new volumes on
   the cluster. You can disable data at rest encryption for volumes that
   do not require encryption of data at rest. See [15]Enabling or
   Disabling Data at Rest Encryption at the Volume Level Using the MapR
   Control System or [16]Enabling or Disabling Data at Rest Encryption at
   the Volume Level Using the CLI and REST API.
