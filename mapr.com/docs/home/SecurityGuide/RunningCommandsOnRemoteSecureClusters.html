Configuring Secure Clusters for Running Commands Remotely

   You can configure a number of secure clusters to access them all from
   one cluster. This way, you need not log into each secure cluster
   separately and run maprcli commands locally on them.

   For example, suppose you need to manage two secure clusters, clusterA
   and clusterB. One method of doing so would be to log into each cluster
   separately and run commands locally on each. However, it is possible to
   log into clusterA only and manage both clusters from clusterA, running
   commands locally for clusterA and remotely for clusterB. When you type
   the maprcli commands, you would use the -cluster parameter in those
   commands to specify which cluster you want the commands to run on.

   You can configure the secure clusters for remote access manually (as
   described below) or automatically by running the
   configure-crosscluster.sh utility. If you run the
   configure-crosscluster.sh utility, the utility configures the clusters
   for running commands remotely in both directions. See
   [1]configure-crosscluster.sh for more information.

Setting Up Secure Clusters Manually for Cross-Cluster Access

   To manually configure two secure clusters for remote access:
    1. Log in to the secure cluster you want to run commands from.
       In the rest of this procedure, this cluster is referred to as
       clusterA and the remote cluster is referred to as clusterB.
    2. Configure clusterA for communicating with the other clusters by
       editing mapr-clusters.conf file on each node clusterA to specify
       the hostname or IP address of the CLDB nodes on the other clusters.
       For example, suppose:
          + clusterA’s /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file contains the
            following:
clusterA.cluster.com secure=true perfnode50.lab:7222
          + clusterB’s /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file contains the
            following:
clusterB.cluster.com secure=true perfnode100.lab:7222
       Perform the following steps to configure the nodes on the clusters:
         a. On any node in clusterA, append the first entry from
            clusterB’s mapr-clusters.conf file, entry which is prefixed
            with the cluster name, to the end of clusterA’s
            mapr-clusters.conf file.
            Note that clusterA’s entry must be the first line of the
            mapr-clusters.conf file:
clusterA.cluster.com secure=true perfnode50.lab:7222
clusterB.cluster.com secure=true perfnode100.lab:7222
            The clusterA’s mapr-clusters.conf file now contains two
            entries.
         b. Copy the updated /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file to all
            the other nodes in clusterA.
         c. On any node in clusterB, append the first entry from
            clusterA’s mapr-clusters.conf file, entry which is prefixed
            with the cluster name, to the end of the remote cluster’s
            mapr-clusters.conf file.
            Note that clusterB’s entry must be the first line of
            mapr-clusters.conf file:
clusterB.cluster.com secure=true perfnode100.lab:7222
clusterA.cluster.com secure=true perfnode50.lab:7222
            The clusterB’s mapr-clusters.conf file now contains two
            entries.
         d. Copy the updated /opt/mapr/conf/mapr-clusters.conf file to all
            the nodes in clusterB.
       See [2]mapr-clusters.conf.
    3. Perform the following steps on clusterA to ensure that the
       ssl_truststore file has signers for all the clusters:
         a. Copy the ssl_truststore from the /opt/mapr/conf directory of
            clusterB into a temporary directory on clusterA.
            For example:
# scp mapr@<remote-ip>:/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore /tmp/clusterB_ssl_truststor
e
         b. Merge the ssl_truststore of clusterB with the ssl_truststore
            of clusterA using the /opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh
            utility.
            For example, if you copied the ssl_truststore file of clusterB
            as /tmp/clusterB_ssl_truststore, run the following command to
            merge the files:
/opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh merge /tmp/clusterB_ssl_truststore /opt/mapr/c
onf/ssl_truststore
         c. Copy the merged ssl_truststore file to every node on clusterA.
    4. Perform the following steps on clusterB only if you want to set up
       access to clusterA from clusterB:
         a. Copy the ssl_truststore from the /opt/mapr/conf directory of
            clusterA into a temporary directory on clusterB.
            For example:
# scp mapr@<remote-ip>:/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore /tmp/clusterA_ssl_truststor
e
         b. Merge the ssl_truststore of clusterB with the ssl_truststore
            of clusterA using the /opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh
            utility.
            For example, if you copied the ssl_truststore file of clusterA
            as /tmp/clusterA_ssl_truststore, run the following command to
            merge the files:
/opt/mapr/server/manageSSLKeys.sh merge /tmp/clusterA_ssl_truststore /opt/mapr/c
onf/ssl_truststore
         c. Copy the merged ssl_truststore file to every node on clusterB.
    5. Verify access by running remote commands on clusterA.
       See [3]Verifying Access to run Remote Commands.

Verifying Access to run Remote Commands

    1. Log in to any node on clusterA and run the [4]maprlogin utility
       from clusterA to obtain user ticket for accessing the remote
       cluster.
       For example, to obtain tickets for managing the remote cluster from
       clusterA, run the following command::
# /opt/mapr/bin/maprlogin password -cluster clusterB.cluster.com
    2. Verify access by running remote commands on clusterA.
       For example, the following command, executed from a node in
       clusterA, lists the volumes on clusterB:
# /opt/mapr/bin/maprcli volume list -cluster clusterB.cluster.com
