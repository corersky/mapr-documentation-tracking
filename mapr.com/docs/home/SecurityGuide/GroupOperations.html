Grouping of Operations

   You can group all filesystem and table operations using the keyword
   all. If the operations to:
     * Include for auditing are specified using the keyword all, you
       cannot specify other individual operations to include as well.
       For example, the following is not allowed:
maprcli volume modify -name v1 -dataauditops +all,+mkdir
     * Exclude from auditing are specified using the keyword all, you
       cannot specify other individual operations to exclude as well.
       For example, the following is not allowed:
maprcli volume modify -name v1 -dataauditops --all,-mkdir

   If operations are specified using the keyword all, ensure that the
   individual operations specified with the same command are used to:
     * Include, if all is used to exclude from auditing.
     * Exclude, if all is used to include for auditing.

   For example, the following is a valid combination of operations to
   audit:
maprcli volume modify -name v1 -dataauditops +all,-mkdir,-lookup
