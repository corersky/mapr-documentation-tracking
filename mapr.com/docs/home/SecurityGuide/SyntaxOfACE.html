ACE Syntax

   An ACE is defined by a combination of user, group, or role definitions.
   You can combine these definitions using the following syntax:
   Operator Description
   u Username or user ID, as they appear in /etc/passwd, of a specific
   user. Usage: u:<username or user ID>
   g Group name or group ID, as they appear in /etc/group, of a specific
   group. Usage: g:<group name or group ID>
   r Name of a specific role. Usage: r:<role name>.
   p Public. Specifies that this operation is available to the public
   without restriction. Cannot be combined with any other operator.
   ! Negation operator. Usage: !<operator>.
   & AND operation.
   | OR operation
   () Delimiters for subexpressions.
   "" The empty string indicates that no user has the specified
   permission.

   An example definition is u:1001 | r:engineering, which restricts access
   to the user with ID 1001 or to any user with the role engineering.

   In this next example, members of the group admin are given access, and
   so are members of the group qa:

   g:admin | g:qa

   For another example, suppose that you have this list of groups to which
   you want to give read permissions:
     * The admin group as a whole, but not the admins for a particular
       cluster (which is named cl3).
     * Members of the qa group who are responsible for testing the two
       applications (named app2 and app3).
     * The business analysts (group ba) in department 7A (group dept_7a)
     * All of the data scientists (group ds) in the company.

   To grant the read permission, you construct this boolean expression:
u:cfkane | (g:admin & !g:cl3) | (g:qa & (g:app2 | g:app3)) | (g:ba & g:dept_7a)
| g:ds

   This expression is made up of five subexpressions which are separated
   by OR operators.
     *
          + The first subexpression u:cfkane grants the read permission to
            the username cfkane.
          + The subexpression (g:admin & !g:cl3) grants the read
            permission to the admins for all clusters except cluster cl3.
            The operator g is the group operator, the value admin is the
            name of the group of all admins. The & operator limits the
            number of administrators who have read permission because only
            those administrators who meet the additional condition will
            have it.
            The condition !g:cl3 is a limiting condition. The operator !
            is the NOT operator. Combined with the group operator, this
            operator means that this group is excluded and does not
            receive the read permission.
            Warning: Be careful when using the NOT operator. You might
            exclude fewer people than you intended. For example, suppose
            that you do not want anyone in the group group_a to have
            access. You therefore define this ACE: !g:group_a You might
            think that the data is now protected because members of
            group_a do not have access to it. However, you have not
            restricted access for anyone else except the members of
            group_a. The rest of the world can access the data. You should
            not define ACEs through exclusion by using the NOT operator.
            You should define them by inclusion and use the NOT operator
            to limit further the access of the groups or roles that you
            have included.
            In the subexpression (g:admin & !g:cl3), the NOT operator
            limits the number of members within the admin group who have
            access. The admin group is included, and all users who are
            also part of the cl3 group are excluded.
     * The subexpression (g:qa & (g:app2 | g:app3)) demonstrates that you
       can use a subexpression within a subexpression. The larger
       subexpression means that only members of group qa who are also
       members of group app2 or app3 have read access to the data. The
       smaller subexpression limits the number of people in the qa group
       have have this permission.
     *
          + The next two subexpressions -- (g:ba & g:dept_7a) and g:ds --
            grant the read permission to the members of group ba who are
            also in the group dept_7a. It also grants permission to the
            members of the group ds.
