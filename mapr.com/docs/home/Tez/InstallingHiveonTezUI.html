Installing the Hive-on-Tez User Interface

   This topic describes installation of the Hive-on-Tez user interface by
   using the MapR Installer or manual steps.

Installation Using the MapR Installer

   When you use the MapR Installer to install Tez, the timeline server for
   the Hive-on-Tez user interface is installed automatically. If the
   Enable MapR Secure Cluster option is enabled in the MapR Installer, the
   timeline server is installed to be secure.
   The Tomcat server is installed into this folder:
/opt/mapr/tez/tez-0.9/tomcat/apache-tomcat-<version>

   To start using the Hive-on-Tez user interface if the Enable MapR Secure
   Cluster option is enabled or if the cluster is Kerberized, you must log
   in to the timeline server user interface:
https://<hostname>:8190

Manual Installation

   To install the Hive-on-Tez user interface manually:
    1. Install and configure mapr-tez as described in [1]Configuring Hive
       2.3 and Tez 0.9.
    2. Install the timeline server:

       On CentOS / Red Hat yum install mapr-timelineserver
       On SUSE             zypper install mapr-timelineserver
       On Ubuntu           apt-get install mapr-timelineserver
       Note: Install the timeline server on a single node. The Hive-on-Tez
       user interface does not support High Availability (HA).
