Hive-on-Tez User Interface Known Issues

   This topic describes known issues that you should be aware of while
   troubleshooting.
   Issue                                Description
   29538 After an incremental install or rolling upgrade to MapR 6.0.x,
   the timeline server cannot be started.
   Workaround: Add the following entry to
   /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/etc/hadoop/yarn-env.sh:
export YARN_TIMELINESERVER_OPTS="${YARN_TIMELINESERVER_OPTS} ${MAPR_LOGIN_OPTS}"

   Note: To be able to obtain job progress and work with Hive on Tez UI
   for non-mapr users on secure clusters (since yarn.admin.acl is enabled
   and allows nobody due to security), modify yarn-site.xml in the
   following way:
<property>
  <name>yarn.admin.acl</name>
  <value><user_name></value>
</property>

   where <user_name> is the user working with Hive.
