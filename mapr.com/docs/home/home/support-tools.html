Customer Experience and Support Tools

   MapR support tools now ships a CLI-based metering utility to better
   understand your cluster and resource usage to give the MapR support
   team insights that will help enhance your support experience.
   Note: The Metering application is available for MapR version 5.2.2 or
   higher.
   This feature is described by the following major topics:
     * [1]Installing the Metering Application
     * [2]Uninstalling the Metering Application
     * [3]Configuring the Metering Application
     * [4]Using the Metering CLI
     * [5]Uploading Metering Measurement Results to MapR
     * [6]Example Metrics JSON

Installing the Metering Application

   Note: Before you begin, ensure you have Java 7+ installed.

   The Metering application must be installed on your MapR cluster,
   preferably on a non-critical node (for example, an edge node or a
   non-CLDB node). In the case that your MapR cluster is offline, you may
   also install Metering on an internet-connected computer in order to
   upload the collected metrics.
   To install the Metering application:
     * [7]RedHat/CentOS
     * [8]Ubuntu
     * [9]SUSE
     * [10]Linux/OSX (from tarball)
     * [11]Windows

    1. Create mapr-metering.repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d/ with the
       contents:
[mapr-metering]
name=mapr-metering
baseurl=http://package.mapr.com/releases/metering/redhat/
gpgcheck=0
    2. Run the following command:
yum install mapr-metering
    3. The Metering application is installed in the /opt/mapr/metering/
       folder.

    1. Add the following entry to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://package.mapr.com/releases/metering/ubuntu/ binary trusty
    2. Run the following commands:
apt-get update
apt-get install mapr-metering
    3. The Metering application is installed in the /opt/mapr/metering/
       folder.

    1. Run the following commands:
zypper ar -f http://package.mapr.com/releases/metering/suse mapr-metering
zypper install mapr-metering
    2. The Metering application is installed in the /opt/mapr/metering/
       folder.

    1. Download package from
       http://package.mapr.com/releases/metering/metering-latest.tar.
    2. Create a metering folder at the desired installation location.
    3. Extract the package contents into the metering folder.

   For example, to install the Metering application at the current working
   directory:
wget http://package.mapr.com/releases/metering/metering-latest.tar
mkdir metering
tar -xvf metering-latest.tar -C metering
cd metering

    1. Download package from
       http://package.mapr.com/releases/metering/metering-latest.tar.
    2. Create a metering folder at the desired installation location.
    3. Extract the package contents into the metering folder.

   Note: The folder in which the Metering application is installed is
   referred to as the "Metering Installation Directory".

Uninstalling the Metering Application

   To uninstall the Metering application:
     * [12]RedHat/CentOS
     * [13]Ubuntu
     * [14]SUSE
     * [15]From Tarball

yum remove mapr-metering

apt-get remove mapr-metering

zypper rm mapr-metering

     * If you are on a MapR cluster, run bin/metering --unschedule from
       the "Metering Installation Directory".
     * Delete the Metering Installation Directory.

Using the Metering CLI

   Note: The Metering application is available to be run as mapr or root
   user ONLY.

   The Metering CLI must be run on the MapR cluster from the "Metering
   Installation Directory". The metrics are outputted in JSON format. See
   [16]Metering Data Descriptions for a list of collected metrics (all
   metrics are collected by default).

   Syntax:
bin/metering <option>

   See [17]Metering CLI Options for a complete list of options.

Configuring the Metering Application

   Note: To schedule metric collection, ensure you have cron installed.

   After installing the Metering application, it is recommended to run
   bin/metering --configure to set the output location of the metrics and
   schedule metric collection and/or upload.

   You can also schedule or unschedule the metric collection with the
   --cron or --unschedule options, respectively. See [18]Metering CLI
   Options for more information.
   Note: MapR recommends you schedule metric collection rather than
   perform it manually.

   The log level can be set from the resources/log4j.metering.properties
   file. The log4j.rootLogger property can be set with ERROR, INFO, or
   DEBUG (listed in increasing level of specificity).

Uploading Metering Measurement Results to MapR

   The process for uploading metrics (transmitting to MapR) depends on
   whether the cluster has internet connectivity:

   Connected to Internet
     * To manually capture metrics and immediately upload it (transmit to
       MapR), run: bin/metering --captureAndUpload.
     * If metrics were captured to be uploaded at a later time, run:
       bin/metering --upload.

   Offline (air-gapped)
    1. On the MapR cluster, run bin/metering --prepareForOfflineSend.
    2. Transfer the resulting zip to an internet-connected computer.

     * [19]Uploading Using Metering
     * [20]SFTP
     * [21]Email

    1. Ensure that your internet-connected computer has the Metering
       application installed.
    2. On the internet-connected computer, run the localUpload command
       from the "Metering Installation Directory".
          + For Linux/OSX:
bin/localUpload <path to meteringMetrics.zip>
          + For Windows:
bin\localUpload.bat <path to meteringMetrics.zip>

   Upload the zip file to MapR's SFTP site at [22]https://sftp.mapr.com/
   with your MapR SFTP login ID and password.
   Email the zip file to support@mapr.com.
