Security

   Securing enterprise data is critical. To make securing data in clusters
   easy, the MapR Data Platform has a data protection scheme built
   directly into the platform which is enabled by default, simplifying the
   process of protecting critical data. You can take advantage of the
   default security settings, or you can implement data security manually.
   Either way, it is important to identify which data to secure.

   Since data must be shared between nodes on the cluster, data
   transmissions between nodes and from the cluster to the client are
   vulnerable to interception. Networked computers are also vulnerable to
   attacks where an intruder successfully pretends to be another
   authorized user and then acts improperly as that user. Additionally,
   networked machines share the security vulnerabilities of a single node.
   The MapR Data Platform supports the ability to apply protection
   directly as data enters and exits the platform. You do not need to
   apply an external management server or particular security plug-in.

   Secure by Default
          MapR, which includes the MapR Data Platform and MEP components,
          is secure out-of-the-box on all new installations, ensuring all
          network connections require authentication and all data in
          motion is protected with wire-level encryption. MapR provides
          the ability to apply security protection directly for data as it
          comes into and out of the platform without requiring an external
          security manager server or a particular security plug-in for
          each ecosystem component. The security semantics are applied
          automatically on data being retrieved or stored by any ecosystem
          component, application, or users.

   Platform-Based Security
          The MapR Data Platform applies security semantics automatically
          as data is being stored and retrieved from the platform. It
          supports all four pillars of security (authentication,
          authorization, auditing, and encryption), using platform-level
          capabilities that do not require external security tools or
          plugins.

   Encryption
          On the MapR Data Platform, data is protected by encrypting all
          data being transmitted over the wire and encrypting all data
          that is stored in the platform.

   The following sections describe MapR's security capabilities and
   security architecture.

Security Capabilities

   A secure MapR environment is predicated on authentication,
   authorization, auditing, and encryption capabilities.

   Authentication
          Restricting access to a specified set of users.

          Robust authentication prevents third parties from representing
          themselves as legitimate users. MapR supports a wide range of
          authentication mechanisms depending on the network transport
          which includes MapR tickets, kerberos, Pluggable Access Module
          (PAM), Basic Authentication, MapRSASL, and SPNEGO.

          See [1]Configuring Authentication for more information.

   Authorization
          Restricting an authenticated user's capabilities on the system.

          MapR provides sophisticated authorization controls to ensure
          that users can perform only the activities for which they have
          permissions, such as data access, job submission, cluster
          administration, etc. These permissions can be granted by an
          administrator through the browser-based MapR Control System
          (MCS) management and monitoring interface or command-line
          utilities.

          See [2]Managing Access Controls for more information.

   Auditing
          Logging audit records of operations.

          MapR allows you to log audit records of cluster-administration
          operations and operations on directories, files, and tables.

          See [3]Managing Auditing for more information.

   Encryption
          Restricting an external party's ability to read data.

          Encryption is used to avoid exposure to breaches, such as packet
          sniffing and theft of storage devices. In a secure MapR cluster,
          data transmission between nodes and between a MapR cluster and
          ecosystem application is encrypted, preventing an attacker with
          access to that communication from gaining information about the
          contents of the transmission. Optionally, you can enable
          encryption for data at rest to prevent unauthorized users from
          accessing sensitive data, and it also protects against data
          theft through sector-level disk access.

          Data is protected by encrypting all data being transmitted over
          the wire and optionally encrypting all that is stored on the
          MapR platform. MapR’s data encryption scheme is built directly
          into the platform and is enabled by default.

          See [4]Managing Encryption for MapR Core for more information.

Security Architecture

   MapR provides the following authentication and authorization
   functionality:

   Filesystem permissions
          For files and directories on the MapR cluster, you can leverage
          standard Unix-style permissions to grant access to authorized
          users. Since MapR Filesystem is a POSIX-like file system, you
          can set user permissions as you would on any other Linux system.
          See [5]Setting MapR Filesystem Permissions for more information.

   Cluster, volume, and job queue Access Control Lists (ACLs)
          You can specify the actions that a given user can perform on
          each of these cluster elements. You can use access control lists
          (ACLs) to grant permissions for performing administrative tasks
          at both the cluster and the volume level. See [6]Managing Access
          Control Lists for more information.

   Access Control Expressions for filesystem and natively stored MapR
          Database tables
          ACEs control which files, directories, volumes, streams, and
          tables users or groups can access. ACEs are a powerful and
          flexible mechanism to grant permissions on structured and
          unstructured data. See [7]Managing Access Control Expressions
          for more information.

   Impersonation for centralized control of access to resources
          Impersonation, also known as identity assertion, is one user
          accessing data and submitting jobs on behalf of another user.
          See [8]Managing Impersonation for more information.

What to do Next

   MapR’s secure-by-default data platform provides security through a
   single option in the [9]MapR Installer or by running the
   [10]configure.sh script with the -secure option after a manual
   installation. You can enable security on your cluster using the
   procedure described in the following:
     * [11]Using the Enable MapR Secure Cluster Option if you are
       installing with the [12]MapR Installer.
     * [13]Enabling Security if you are [14]Installing without the MapR
       Installer.

   After enabling security, optionally, you can do the following:
     * Understand the [15]security exceptions and take corrective action,
       where applicable.
     * Configure [16]authorization on the resources.
     * Configure [17]auditing on administration and resources.
     * Configure [18]encryption for data at rest.
     * If you have Hive installed, [19]enable storage-based authorization
       for the Hive Metastore server.
