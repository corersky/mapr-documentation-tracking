Volumes, Snapshots, and Mirrors

   Volumes are a management entity that logically organizes a cluster’s
   data. Since a container always belongs to exactly one volume, that
   container’s replicas all belong to the same volume as well. Volumes do
   not have a fixed size and they do not occupy disk space until MapR file
   system writes data to a container within the volume. A large volume may
   contain anywhere from 50-100 million containers.

   The CLI and REST API provide functionality for volume management.
   Typical use cases include volumes for specific users, projects,
   development, and production environments. For example, if an
   administrator needs to organize data for a special project, the
   administrator can create a specific volume for the project. MapR file
   system organizes all containers that store the project data within the
   project volume. A cluster can have many volumes.

   MapR file system creates a name container for each volume. The name
   container stores the volume’s namespace and file chunk locations, along
   with inodes for the objects in the filesystem. The file system stores
   the metadata for files and directories in the name container, which is
   updated with each write operation.

   The first 64KB of each file in a volume is written to the name
   container. Data beyond the 64KB is written to data containers. Data
   containers are created only when the file or table data goes above
   64KB. Each name or data container is associated with only one volume;
   volumes may have many associated data containers, but only one name
   container.

   Local volumes are confined to one node and are not replicated. Local
   volumes are part of the cluster’s global namespace and are accessible
   on the path /var/mapr/local/<host>.

   On a cluster with an Enterprise Edition or Enterprise Database Edition
   license, you can create a special type of volume called a mirror, a
   local or remote read-only copy of an entire volume. Mirrors are useful
   for load balancing or disaster recovery. You can also create a
   snapshot, an image of a volume at a specific point in time. Snapshots
   are useful for rollback to a known data set. You can create snapshots
   and synchronize mirrors manually or using a schedule.

   On a cluster, you can create a tenant share, or volume for tenant
   users. A tenant share is an isolated space where you can set different
   policies, quotas, and access privileges for specific users/hosts
   (referred to as tenants). This allows each tenant to own its own copy
   of storage space, users, data security, administration, etc. For more
   information, see [1]Multitenancy on MapR Filesystem.

Snapshots

   Snapshots enable you to roll back to a known good data set. A snapshot
   is a read-only image of a volume that provides point-in-time recovery.
   Snapshots only store changes to the data stored in the volume, and as a
   result make extremely efficient use of the cluster’s disk resources.
   Snapshots preserve access to historical data and protect the cluster
   from user and application errors. You can create a snapshot manually or
   automate the process with a schedule.

   The following image represents a mirror volume and a snapshot created
   from a source volume:

   New write operations on a volume with a snapshot are redirected to
   preserve the original data. Snapshots only store the incremental
   changes in a volume’s data from the time the snapshot was created. The
   storage used by a volume's snapshots does not count against the
   volume's quota.

Mirror Volumes

   MapR provides built-in mirroring to set recovery time objectives and
   automatically mirror data for backup. You can create local or remote
   mirror volumes to mirror data between clusters, data centers, or
   between on-premise and public cloud infrastructures.

   Mirror volumes are read-only copies of a source volume. You can control
   the schedule for mirror refreshes from the MapR Control System or with
   the command-line tools. Local (on the same cluster) or remote (on a
   different cluster) mirror volumes can be created from the MCS or from
   the command line.

   When a mirror volume is created, MapR file system creates a temporary
   snapshot of the source volume. The mirroring process reads content from
   the snapshot into the mirror volume. The source volume remains
   available for read and write operations during the mirroring process.
   The initial mirroring operation copies the entire source volume.
   Subsequent mirroring operations only update the differences between the
   source volume and the mirror volume.

   Mirror volumes can be promoted to read-write volumes. The main use case
   for this feature is to support disaster-recovery scenarios in which a
   read-only mirror needs to be promoted to a read-write volume so that it
   can become the primary volume for data storage. In addition, read-write
   volumes that were mirrored to other volumes can be made into mirrors
   (to establish a mirroring relationship in the other direction). You can
   also convert read-write volumes back to read-only mirrors.
