POSIX Clients

   The MapR File System supports direct and secure access to data using
   loopback NFS or FUSE-based POSIX clients.

   The loopbacknfs POSIX client allows app servers, web servers, and other
   client nodes and apps to read and write data directly and securely to a
   MapR cluster, with transmitted data compressed in both directions. The
   MapR single-user mapr-loopbacknfs licenses gives secure access to one
   or more clusters, which allows native client applications to run
   securely on cluster data.

   The FUSE-based POSIX basic and platinum clients run as a userspace
   process to connect to one or more MapR clusters and allow app servers,
   web servers, and applications to read and write data directly and
   securely to the MapR clusters like a Linux filesystem. Each client
   implies a specific MapR file system throughput optimization of n/G per
   second.

   Both loopbacknfs and FUSE-based POSIX clients can be installed on
   supported Linux and Ubuntu distributions and require direct network
   access to all MapR cluster nodes. They connect to the MapR cluster
   directly (no NFS gateway) to read and write data securely.

   See the [1]MapR NFS, HDFS & POSIX Community Site for additional
   information.
