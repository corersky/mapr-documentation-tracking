YARN

   YARN is a resource management and scheduling framework that distributes
   resource management and job management duties. YARN assigns the
   resource management and job management duties as follows:
     * ResourceManager: manages cluster resources and tracks resource
       usage and node health
     * ApplicationMaster: a framework-specific process that negotiates
       resources for a single application (a single job or a directed
       acyclic graph of jobs), which runs in the first container allocated
       for the application
     * A YARN component called the HistoryServer archives job metrics and
       metadata. Status on completed applications is available via REST
       APIs.

   The ResourceManager allocates resources among all the applications
   running the cluster. The ResourceManager includes a pluggable
   scheduler, which is responsible for allocating resources according to
   the resource requirements of the running applications. Current
   MapReduce schedulers, including the Capacity Scheduler and the Fair
   Scheduler, can be plugged into the YARN scheduler directly.

   Label-based scheduling provides job placement control on a multi-tenant
   Hadoop cluster. Administrators can control exactly which nodes are
   chosen to run jobs submitted by different users and groups. An
   administrator assigns node labels in a text file, then composes queue
   labels or job labels based on the node labels. When users run jobs,
   they can place them on specified nodes on a per-job basis (using a job
   label) or on a per-queue level (using a queue label).

   The ResourceManager caches the mapping file, and checks every two
   minutes (the default monitoring period) for updates. If the file has
   been modified, the ResourceManager updates the labels for all active
   ApplicationMasters immediately.
   Each application runs an ApplicationMaster to negotiate resources from
   the ResourceManager. The ApplicationMaster works with the NodeManagers
   to execute and monitor tasks. The duties of the ApplicationMaster are
   divided as follows:
     * NodeManager: One instance runs on each node, to manage that node's
       resources.
     * Container: An abstraction representing a unit of resources on a
       node.

   The NodeManager provides containers to an application. The
   ResourceManager and the NodeManager provide the system for distributed
   management of applications and resources.
