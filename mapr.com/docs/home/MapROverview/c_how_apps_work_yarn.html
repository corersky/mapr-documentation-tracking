How Applications Work in YARN

   The following diagram and list of steps provides information about data
   flow during application execution in YARN.

   Application execution consists of the following steps:
    1. A client submits an application to the YARN ResourceManager,
       including the information required for the CLC.
    2. The ApplicationsManager (in the ResourceManager) negotiates a
       container and bootstraps the ApplicationMaster instance for the
       application.
    3. The ApplicationMaster registers with the ResourceManager and
       requests containers.
    4. The ApplicationMaster communicates with NodeManagers to launch the
       containers it has been granted, specifying the CLC for each
       container.
    5. The ApplicationMaster manages application execution. During
       execution, the application provides progress and status information
       to the ApplicationMaster. The client can monitor the applicationâ€™s
       status by querying the ResourceManager or by communicating directly
       with the ApplicationMaster.
    6. The ApplicationMaster reports completion of the application to the
       ResourceManager.
    7. The ApplicationMaster un-registers with the ResourceManager, which
       then cleans up the ApplicationMaster container.
