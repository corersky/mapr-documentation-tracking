Understanding the MapR Data Access Gateway

   The MapR Data Access Gateway is a service that acts as a proxy and
   gateway for translating requests between lightweight client
   applications and the MapR cluster. For the MEP 5.0 release, the service
   is used by the MapR Database JSON REST API. Starting in the MEP 6.0
   release, the service is also used by the Node.js and Python OJAI
   clients.

   For the OJAI clients that connect to the Data Access Gateway, MapR uses
   [1]gRPC, an open-source RPC framework, to expose the MapR Database OJAI
   API to the client. RPC message headers for individual messages are
   encoded using [2]Protocol Buffers. The message payload is encoded using
   an OJAI JSON encoding. Depending on whether your MapR cluster has
   security enabled, TLS is either enabled or disabled, by default, for
   the gRPC service. When TLS is enabled, the SSL provider is OpenSSL.

   The service runs on nodes in your MapR cluster. You can install the
   service [3]manually or by using the [4]MapR Installer. Both
   installation methods support upgrades of existing MapR clusters. When
   installing the service, you can decide the number of nodes to install
   the service on. The number you need depends on your scalability
   requirements.

   Regardless of your scalability requirements, you should install the
   service on at least two nodes, to provide high availability. To load
   balance requests and to achieve high availability and failover, you
   must use an external load balancer. For recommendations and best
   practices when using an external load balancer with gRPC, see [5]gRPC
   Load Balancing.

   The service runs as user mapr. But the service issues all data access
   calls on behalf of the user requesting the data. For example, if user
   john is running the client application, the service reads data using
   the authorization of john, not mapr.

   All traffic between the Data Access Gateway and other MapR services is
   encrypted. This is done regardless of whether the underlying MapR file
   system volume has encryption enabled.

   [6]Warden manages the MapR Data Access Gateway. It handles stopping and
   starting of the service during node failovers and also controls the
   amount of memory assigned to the service.
