Understanding the MapR Data Access Gateway

   The MapR Data Access Gateway is a service that acts as a proxy and
   gateway for translating requests between lightweight client
   applications and the MapR cluster. For the MEP 5.0 release, the service
   is used by the MapR-DB JSON REST API.

   The service runs on nodes in your MapR cluster. You can install the
   service [1]manually or using the [2]MapR Installer. Both installation
   methods also support upgrades of existing MapR clusters. When
   installing the service, you can decide the number of nodes to install
   the service on. The number you need depends on your scalability
   requirements. Regardless of your scalability requirements, you should
   install the service on at least two nodes, to provide high
   availability. To load balance requests and to achieve high availability
   and failover, you must use an external load balancer.

   The service runs as user mapr. But, the service issues all data access
   calls on behalf of the user requesting the data. For example, if user
   john is running the client application, the service reads data using
   the authorization of john, not mapr.

   All traffic between the Data Access Gateway and other MapR services is
   encrypted. This is done regardless of whether the underlying MapR-FS
   volume has encryption enabled.

   [3]Warden manages the MapR Data Access Gateway. It handles stopping and
   starting of the service during node failovers and also controls the
   amount of memory assigned to the service.
