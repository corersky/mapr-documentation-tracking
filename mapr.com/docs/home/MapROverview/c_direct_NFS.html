Direct Access NFS

   The MapR direct access file system enables real-time read/write data
   ﬂows using the Network File System (NFS) protocol. Standard
   applications and tools can directly access the MapR Filesystem storage
   layer using NFS. Legacy systems can access data, and traditional file
   I/O operations work as expected in a conventional UNIX file system. A
   remote client can easily mount a MapR cluster over NFS to move data to
   and from the cluster. Application servers can write log ﬁles and other
   data directly to the MapR cluster’s storage layer instead of caching
   the data on an external direct or network-attached storage.

   You can mount a MapR cluster directly through a network file system
   (NFS) from a Linux or Mac client. When you mount a MapR cluster,
   applications can read and write data directly into the cluster with
   standard tools, applications, and scripts. MapR enables direct file
   modification and multiple concurrent reads and writes with POSIX
   semantics. For example, you can run a MapReduce application that
   outputs to a CSV file, and then import the CSV file directly into SQL
   through NFS.

   MapR exports each cluster as the directory /mapr/<cluster name>. If you
   create a mount point with the local path /mapr, Hadoop FS paths and NFS
   paths to the cluster will be the same. This makes it easy to work on
   the same files through NFS and Hadoop. In a multi-cluster setting, the
   clusters share a single namespace. You can see them all by mounting the
   top-level /mapr directory.
