Storage Pools

   MapR-FS storage architecture consists of multiple storage pools that
   reside on each node in a cluster. A storage pool is made up of one or
   more disks grouped by MapR-FS. The default number of disks in a storage
   pool is three. The containers that hold MapR-FS data are stored in and
   replicated among the storage pools in the cluster.

   The following image represents disks grouped together to create storage
   pools that reside on a node:

   Write operations within a storage pool are striped across disks to
   improve write performance. Stripe width and depth are configurable with
   the disksetup script. Since MapR-FS performs data replication, RAID
   configuration is unnecessary.
