Storage Pools

   MapR Filesystem storage architecture consists of multiple storage pools
   that reside on each node in a cluster. A storage pool is made up of one
   or more disks grouped by MapR file system. The default number of disks
   in a storage pool is three. The containers that hold MapR file system
   data are stored in and replicated among the storage pools in the
   cluster.

   The following image represents disks grouped together to create storage
   pools that reside on a node:

   Write operations within a storage pool are striped across disks to
   improve write performance. Stripe width and depth are configurable with
   the disksetup script. Since MapR file system performs data replication,
   RAID configuration is unnecessary.
