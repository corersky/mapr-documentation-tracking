Central Configuration

   Each service on a node has one or more configuration files associated
   with it. The default version of each configuration file is stored
   locally under /opt/mapr/.
   Customized versions of the configuration files are placed in the
   mapr.configuration volume, which is mounted at:
/var/mapr/configuration

   The following diagram illustrates where each configuration file is
   stored:

   MapR uses the pullcentralconfig script to detect customized
   configuration files in:
/var/mapr/configuration

   This script is launched every five minutes by default. When the script
   finds a customized file, it overwrites the local files in /opt/mapr.
   First, the script looks for node-specific custom configuration files
   under:
/var/mapr/configuration/nodes/<hostname>

   If the script does not find any configuration files at that location,
   the script searches for cluster-wide configuration files under:
/var/mapr/configuration/default

   The /default directory stores cluster-wide configuration files that
   apply to all nodes in the cluster by default.
