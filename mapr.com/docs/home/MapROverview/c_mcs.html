MapR Control System

   The MapR Control System (MCS) provides a graphical control panel for
   cluster administration with all the functionality of the command-line
   or REST APIs. The MCS provides job monitoring metrics and helps you
   troubleshoot issues, such as which jobs required the most memory in a
   given week or which events caused job and task failures.

   The MCS provides various views, which you can use to configure and
   monitor your cluster:

   Overview
          The MCS Overview page provides a summary of information about
          the cluster including a cluster heat map that displays the
          health of each node organized by service, an alarms summary,
          cluster utilization that shows the CPU, memory, and disk space
          usage, the number of available, unavailable, and under
          replicated volumes, and MapReduce applications.

   Services
          The MCS Services page provides a summary of the services running
          across the cluster.

   Nodes
          The MCS Nodes page provides a summary of information about the
          nodes on the cluster including a heat map that displays the
          health of each node, resource utiization that shows the CPU and
          memory usage, all active alarms, and a list of all the nodes on
          the cluster with links that provide shortcuts to more detailed
          information about the node.

   Data
          The MCS Data dropdown menu contains links to pages that provide
          summary of information about volumes, tables, and streams.

   Admin
          The MCS Admin dropdown menu contains links to pages for user and
          cluster management tasks such as setting up permissions, quotas,
          and email settings for users, enabling cluster-level and data
          auditing, configuring balancer settings, and adding licenses.

   Note: During installation using the MapR Installer, you can configure
   metrics and logging using settings on the Monitoring page of the MapR
   Installer user interface. The metrics collection infrastructure must be
   installed because the MapR Control System relies on these metrics to
   provide graphs and charts. If the metrics collection infrastructure is
   not installed, you cannot visualize the metrics in the panes on the
   MapR Control System.
