Architecture

   MapR-DB is an enterprise-grade, high performance, NoSQL (“Not Only
   SQL”) database management system. You can use it to add realtime,
   operational analytics capabilities to big data applications. As a
   multi-model NoSQL database, it supports both JSON document models and
   wide column data models.

Why use MapR-DB?

     * Integrated analytics with SQL: MapR-DB's integration with Drill for
       MapR provides a low latency, distributed, SQL-like query engine for
       large-scale datasets, including structured and semi-structured,
       nested data.
     * Operational analytics: MapR-DB can run in the same cluster as
       Apache™ Hadoop® and Apache Spark, letting you immediately analyze
       or process live, interactive data. This also enables you to
       eliminate data silos to speed the data-to-action cycle, providing a
       more efficient data architecture.
     * Global distribution of applications: Application access to MapR-DB
       tables is distributable on a global scale.
     * Flexible data model: You can use MapR-DB as both a document
       database and a wide-column database. As a document database,
       MapR-DB stores JSON documents in JSON tables. As a wide-column
       database, it stores binary files in binary tables.

How is MapR-DB Related to MapR-FS?

   MapR-DB implements tables within the framework of the MapR file system
   (MapR-FS). MapR-DB creates tables (both binary and JSON tables) in
   logical units called volumes.

What are MapR-DB's Architectural Advantages?

   MapR-DB's architecture has the following advantages:
     * It reduces process overhead because it has no extra layers to pass
       through when performing operations on data.
       MapR-DB, like several other NoSQL databases, is a log-based
       database. MapR-DB runs inside of the MapR-FS process, which enables
       it to read from and write to disks directly. In contrast, other
       NoSQL databases must communicate with a separate process to
       performs disk reads and writes. The approach taken by MapR-DB
       eliminates extra process hops, duplicate caching, and needless
       abstractions, with the consequence of optimizing I/O operations on
       your data.
     * It minimizes compaction delays because it avoids I/O storms when it
       merges logged operations with structures on disk.
       As a log-based database, MapR-DB must write logged operations to
       disk. MapR-DB stores table regions (also called tablets) and
       smaller structures within them partially as b-trees. Together with
       write-ahead logs (WAL), these b-trees comprise log-structured-merge
       trees. Write-ahead logs for the smaller structures within regions
       are periodically restructured by rolling merge operations on the
       b-trees. Because MapR-DB performs these merges at small scales,
       applications running against MapR-DB see no significant effects on
       latency while the merges are taking place.
       Note: Apache HBase also uses the term regions. MapR has deprecated
       support for Apache HBase.

What Design Factors are Important when Using MapR-DB?

     * Rowkey Optimization: The design of a table's rowkeys affects the
       speed at which client applications can access data. It also impacts
       database performance if hotspotting occurs. The better the design,
       the faster the data access. See [1]Table Rowkey Design for more
       information.
     * Column Family Optimization: Column families enable you to group
       related sets of data and restrict queries to a defined subset,
       leading to better performance. When you design a column family,
       think about what kinds of queries you are going to use most often,
       and group your columns accordingly. See [2]Column Families in JSON
       Tables and [3]Column Families in Binary Tables for more
       information.
     * Replication Implementation: The design of table replication (in
       addition to the automatic replication that occurs with table
       regions within a volume) depends on your desired outcome and the
       complexity of your environment. See [4]Table Replication for more
       information.
     * Security Implementation: You can implement security at many
       different levels including for table replication, JSON documents,
       and general access. Determining what level and where is part of the
       architectural design. See [5]Security on JSON Tables, [6]Security
       and Replication, and [7]Security .
