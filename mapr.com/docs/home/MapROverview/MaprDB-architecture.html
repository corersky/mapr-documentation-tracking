Architecture

   MapR Database is an enterprise-grade, high performance, NoSQL (“Not
   Only SQL”) database management system. You can use it to add realtime,
   operational analytics capabilities to big data applications. As a
   multi-model NoSQL database, it supports both JSON document models and
   wide column data models.

Why use MapR Database?

     * Integrated analytics with SQL: MapR Database's integration with
       Drill for MapR provides a low latency, distributed, SQL query
       engine for large-scale datasets, including structured and
       semi-structured, nested data.
     * Operational analytics: MapR Database can run in the same cluster as
       Apache™ Hadoop® and Apache Spark, letting you immediately analyze
       or process live, interactive data. This also enables you to
       eliminate data silos to speed the data-to-action cycle, providing a
       more efficient data architecture.
     * Global distribution of applications: Application access to MapR
       Database tables is distributable on a global scale.
     * Flexible data model: You can use MapR Database as both a document
       database and a wide-column database. As a document database, MapR
       Database stores JSON documents in JSON tables. As a wide-column
       database, it stores binary files in binary tables.

How is MapR Database Related to MapR Filesystem?

   MapR Database implements tables within the framework of the MapR file
   system MapR Database creates tables (both binary and JSON tables) in
   logical units called volumes.

What are MapR Database's Architectural Advantages?

   MapR Database's architecture has the following advantages:
     * It reduces process overhead because it has no extra layers to pass
       through when performing operations on data.
       MapR Database, like several other NoSQL databases, is a log-based
       database. MapR Database runs inside of the MapR file system
       process, which enables it to read from and write to disks directly.
       In contrast, other NoSQL databases must communicate with a separate
       process to performs disk reads and writes. The approach taken by
       MapR Database eliminates extra process hops, duplicate caching, and
       needless abstractions, with the consequence of optimizing I/O
       operations on your data.
     * It minimizes compaction delays because it avoids I/O storms when it
       merges logged operations with structures on disk.
       As a log-based database, MapR Database must write logged operations
       to disk. MapR Database stores table regions (also called tablets)
       and smaller structures within them partially as b-trees. Together
       with write-ahead logs (WAL), these b-trees comprise
       log-structured-merge trees. Write-ahead logs for the smaller
       structures within regions are periodically restructured by rolling
       merge operations on the b-trees. Because MapR Database performs
       these merges at small scales, applications running against MapR
       Database see no significant effects on latency while the merges are
       taking place.
       Note: Apache HBase also uses the term regions. MapR has deprecated
       support for Apache HBase.

What Design Factors are Important when Using MapR Database?

     * Rowkey Optimization: The design of a table's rowkeys affects the
       speed at which client applications can access data. It also impacts
       database performance if hotspotting occurs. The better the design,
       the faster the data access. See [1]Table Rowkey Design for more
       information.
     * Column Family Optimization: Column families enable you to group
       related sets of data and restrict queries to a defined subset,
       leading to better performance. When you design a column family,
       think about what kinds of queries you are going to use most often,
       and group your columns accordingly. See [2]Column Families in JSON
       Tables and [3]Column Families in Binary Tables for more
       information.
     * Replication Implementation: The design of table replication (in
       addition to the automatic replication that occurs with table
       regions within a volume) depends on your desired outcome and the
       complexity of your environment. See [4]Table Replication for more
       information.
     * Security Implementation: You can implement security at many
       different levels including for table replication, JSON documents,
       and general access. Determining what level and where is part of the
       architectural design. See [5]Security on JSON Tables, [6]Security
       and Replication, and [7]Security.
