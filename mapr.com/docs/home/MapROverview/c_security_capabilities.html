Security Capabilities

   Describes authentication, authorization, and encryption capabilities. A
   secure MapR environment is predicated on authentication, authorization,
   and encryption capabilities.

   Authentication
          Restricting access to a specified set of users. Robust
          authentication prevents third parties from representing
          themselves as legitimate users.

   Authorization
          Restricting an authenticated user's capabilities on the system.
          MapR provides sophisticated authorization controls to ensure
          that users can perform only the activities for which they have
          permissions, such as data access, job submission, cluster
          administration, etc. These permissions can be granted by an
          administrator via the browser-based MapR Control System (MCS)
          management and monitoring interface or command line utilities.

   Encryption
          Restricting an external party's ability to read data. Data
          transmission between nodes in a secure MapR cluster is
          encrypted, preventing an attacker with access to that
          communication from gaining information about the transmission's
          contents.
