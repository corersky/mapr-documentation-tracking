MapR-DB as a Wide-Column Database

   MapR-DB supports binary tables as a native data store. MapR-DB binary
   tables are identical conceptually to tables in Apache HBase.
   MapR-DB as a wide-column database, stores data in binary format in
   MapR-DB binary tables. These binary tables are considered to be
   wide-column tables. If you're familiar with HBase tables, you'll be
   right at home with MapR-DB binary tables. In fact, your HBase
   applications can switch to using MapR-DB binary tables with no coding
   changes required.
     * MapR-DB binary tables use the HBase data model and support the
       HBase API.
     * Allows for large scale applications managing columnar data.
     * Binary compatibility with applications using standard HBase
       application APIs.
     * With the binary tables, rows are indexed by key, columns identify
       data elements in each row, and column families are made up of
       columns. [binary-tables.png]
