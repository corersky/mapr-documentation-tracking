MapR Database as a Wide-Column Database

   MapR Database supports binary tables as a native data store. MapR
   Database binary tables are identical conceptually to tables in Apache
   HBase.
   MapR Database as a wide-column database, stores data in binary format
   in MapR Database binary tables. These binary tables are considered to
   be wide-column tables. If you're familiar with HBase tables, you'll be
   right at home with MapR Database binary tables. In fact, your HBase
   applications can switch to using MapR Database binary tables with no
   coding changes required.
     * MapR Database binary tables use the HBase data model and support
       the HBase API.
     * Allows for large scale applications managing columnar data.
     * Binary compatibility with applications using standard HBase
       application APIs.
     * With the binary tables, rows are indexed by key, columns identify
       data elements in each row, and column families are made up of
       columns. [binary-tables.png]
