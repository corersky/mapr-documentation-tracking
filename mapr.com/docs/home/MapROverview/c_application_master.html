ApplicationMaster

   The ApplicationMaster is an instance of a framework-specific library
   that negotiates resources from the ResourceManager and works with the
   NodeManager to execute and monitor the granted resources (bundled as
   containers) for a given application. An application can be a process or
   set of processes, a service, or a description of work.

   The ApplicationMaster is run in a container like any other application.
   The ApplicationsManager, part of the ResourceManager, negotiates for
   the container in which an applicationâ€™s ApplicationMaster runs when the
   application is scheduled by the YarnScheduler.
   While an application is running, the ApplicationMaster manages the
   following:
     * Application lifecycle
     * Dynamic adjustments to resource consumption
     * Execution flow
     * Faults
     * Providing status and metrics

   The ApplicationMaster is architected to support a specific framework,
   and can be written in any language since its communication with the
   NodeManagers and the ResourceManager is accomplished using extensible
   communication protocols. The ApplicationMaster can be customized to
   extend the framework or run any other code. For this reason, the
   ApplicationMaster is not considered trustworthy, and is not run as a
   trusted service.

   An ApplicationMaster typically requests resources on multiple nodes to
   complete a job by sending the ResourceManager requests that include
   locality preferences and attributes of the containers. When the
   ResourceManager is able to allocate a resource to the
   ApplicationMaster, it generates a lease that the ApplicationMaster
   pulls on a subsequent heartbeat. A security token associated with the
   lease guarantees its authenticity when the ApplicationManager presents
   the lease to the NodeManager to gain access to the container.

   The Application Master heartbeats to the ResourceManager to communicate
   its changing resource needs, and to let the ResourceManager know it is
   still alive. In response, the ResourceManager can return a lease on
   additional containers on other nodes, or cancel the lease on some
   containers. The ApplicationMaster can then adjust its execution
   strategy to fit the increase or decrease in available resources. When
   cluster resources become scarce, the ResourceManager can also request
   that the ApplicationMaster relinquish some resources. The
   ApplicationMaster can move work to other running containers in order to
   give up resources gracefully.

Containers

   A YARN container is a result of a successful resource allocation,
   meaning that the ResourceManager has granted an application a lease to
   use a specific set of resources in certain amounts on a specific node.
   The ApplicationMaster presents the lease to the NodeManager on the node
   where the container has been allocated, thereby gaining access to the
   resources.
   To launch the container, the ApplicationMaster must provide a container
   launch context (CLC) that includes the following information:
     * Environment variables
     * Dependencies (local resources such as data files or shared objects
       needed prior to launch)
     * Security tokens
     * The command necessary to create the process the application plans
       to launch

   The CLC makes it possible for the ApplicationMaster to use containers
   to run a variety of different kinds of work, from simple shell scripts
   to applications to virtual machines.
