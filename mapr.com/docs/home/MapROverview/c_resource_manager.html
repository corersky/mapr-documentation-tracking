ResourceManager

   The ResourceManager is mainly concerned with arbitrating available
   resources in the cluster among competing applications, with the goal of
   maximum cluster utilization. The ResourceManager includes a pluggable
   scheduler called the YarnScheduler, which allows different policies for
   managing constraints such as capacity, fairness, and service level
   agreements.

   Figure 1. Internal Components of the Resource Manager
   The Resource manager manages resources as follows:
     * Each NodeManager takes instructions from the ResourceManager,
       reporting and handling containers on a single node
     * Each ApplicationMaster requests resources from the ResourceManager,
       then works with containers provided by NodeManagers

   The ResourceManager communicates with application clients via an
   interface called the ClientService. A client can submit or terminate an
   application and gain information about the scheduling queue or cluster
   statistics through the ClientService.

   Administrative requests are served by a separate interface called the
   AdminService, through which operators can get updated information about
   cluster operation.

   Behind the scenes, the ResourceTrackerService receives node heartbeats
   from the NodeManager to track new or decommissioned nodes. The
   NMLivelinessMonitor and NodesListManager keep an updated status of
   which nodes are healthy so that the scheduler and the
   ResourceTrackerService can allocate work appropriately.

   A component called the ApplicationMasterService manages
   ApplicationMasters on all nodes, keeping the scheduler informed. A
   component called the AMLivelinessMonitor keeps a list of
   ApplicationMasters and their last heartbeat times, in order to let the
   ResourceManager know what applications are healthy on the cluster. Any
   ApplicationMaster that does not heartbeat within a certain interval is
   marked as dead and re-scheduled to run on a new container.

   At the core of the ResourceManager is an interface called the
   ApplicationsManager, which maintains a list of applications that have
   been submitted, are running, or are completed. The ApplicationsManager
   accepts job submissions, negotiates the first container for an
   application (in which the ApplicationMaster will run) and restarts the
   ApplicationMaster if it fails.

   The ResourceManager and NodeManagers communicate via heartbeats.

   Configure the ResourceManager for high availability so that the failure
   of the ResourceManager service is a not single point of failure for the
   cluster. High availability of the ResourceManager is configured by
   default when you run configure.sh without specifying the -RM parameter.
