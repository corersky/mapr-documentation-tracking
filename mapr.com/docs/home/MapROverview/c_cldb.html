CLDB

CLDB

   The Container Location Database (CLDB) service tracks the following
   information about every container in MapR-FS:
     * The node where the container is located.
     * The container’s size.
     * The volume the container belongs to.
     * The policies, quotas, and usage for that volume.

   For more information on containers, see [1]MapR-FS.

   The CLDB also tracks fileservers in the cluster and node activity.
   Running the CLDB service on multiple nodes distributes lookup
   operations across those nodes for load balancing, and also provides
   high availability.

   When a cluster runs the CLDB service on multiple nodes, one node acts
   as the master CLDB and the others act as slaves. The master node has
   read and write access to the file system, while slave nodes only have
   read access. The kvstore (key-value store) container has the container
   ID 1, and holds cluster-related information. The ZooKeeper tracks
   container information for the kvstore container. The CLDB assigns a
   container ID to each new container it creates. The CLDB service tracks
   the location of containers in the cluster by the container ID.

   When a client application opens a file, the application queries the
   CLDB for for the container ID of the root volume’s name container. The
   CLDB returns the container ID and the IP addresses of the nodes in the
   cluster where the replicas of that container are stored. The client
   application looks up the volume associated with the file in the root
   volume’s name container, then queries the CLDB for the container ID and
   IP addresses of the nodes in the cluster with the name container for
   the target volume. The target volume’s name container has the file ID
   and inode for the target file. The client application uses this
   information to open the file for a read or write operation.

   Each fileserver heartbeats to the CLDB periodically, at a frequency
   ranging anywhere from 1-3 seconds depending on the cluster size, to
   report its status and container information. The CLDB may raise alarms
   based on the status communicated by the FileServer.
