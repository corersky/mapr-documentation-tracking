Authorization with Volumes: Intelligent Policy Management

   The MapR File System uses volumes as a unique management entity. A
   volume is a logical unit that you create to apply policies to a set of
   files, directories, tables, and sub-volumes. You can create volumes for
   each user, department, or project. Mirror volumes and volume snapshots
   provide data recovery and data protection functionality.

   Volumes can enforce disk usage limits, set replication levels,
   establish ownership and control permissible actions, and measure the
   cost generated by different projects or departments. When you set
   policies on a volume, all files contained within the volume inherit the
   same policies set on the volume. Other Hadoop distributions require
   administrators to manage policies at the file level.

   You can manage volume permissions through one of the following:
     * Access Control Lists (ACLs) in the MapR Control System or from the
       command line. ACLs can be used to control administrative access to
       volumes.
     * Access Control Expressions (ACEs) in the MapR Control System or
       from the command line. ACEs can be used to control data access
       using boolean expressions.

   You can also set read, write, and execute permissions on a file or
   directory for users and groups with ACEs and standard UNIX commands,
   when that volume has been mounted through NFS, or using standard hadoop
   fs commands.
