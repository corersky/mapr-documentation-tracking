Data Models

   MapR-DB can be used as both a document database and a wide-column
   database. As a document database, JSON documents are stored in MapR-DB
   JSON table. As a wide-column database, binary files are in stored
   MapR-DB binary tables.

MapR-DB as a Document Database

   JSON documents are stored in MapR-DB JSON tables. When you create a
   table in a volume, the table type is specified as JSON. Only JSON-like
   documents can be stored in JSON tables. Also, typically, tables of the
   same type (in this case, JSON) are created in their own volume.

   Each document is stored in a table row and indexed by the "_id" field.

MapR-DB as a Wide-Column Database

   Binary data is stored in a table row where rows are indexed by key and
   columns identify data elements in each row. Also, typically, tables of
   the same type (in this case, binary) are created in their own volume.
