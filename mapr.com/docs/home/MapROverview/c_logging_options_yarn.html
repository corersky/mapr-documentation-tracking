Logging Options on YARN

   For YARN applications, there are various logging options to choose from
   based on the MapR version and the types of applications that you run.
   In 4.0.2 and later versions, you have the following logging options:
     * For MapReduce version 2 (MRv2) applications, the default logging
       option is to log files on the local file system. However, central
       logging and YARN log aggregation are also available.
     * For non-MapReduce applications, the default logging option is to
       log files on the local file system. However,YARN log aggregation is
       also available.

   Centralized Logging for MRv2
          Centralized logging provides an application-centric view of all
          the log files generated by NodeManager nodes throughout the
          cluster. It enables users to gain a complete picture of
          application execution by having all the logs available in a
          single directory, without having to navigate from node to node.

          The MapReduce program generates three types of log output:

          + Standard output stream: captured in the stdout file
          + Standard error stream: captured in the stderr file
          + Log4j logs: captured in the syslog file

          Centralized logs are available cluster-wide as they are written
          to the following local volume on the MapR file system: /

var/mapr/local/<NodeManager node>/logs/yarn/userlogs

          Since the log files are stored in a local volume directory that
          is associated with each NodeManager node, you run the maprcli
          job linklogs command to create symbolic links for all the logs
          in a single directory. You can then use tools such as grep and
          awk to analyze them from an NFS mount point. You can also view
          the entire set of logs for a particular application using the
          HistoryServer UI.

   YARN Log Aggregation
          The YARN log aggregation option aggregates logs from the local
          file system and moves log files for completed applications from
          the local file system to the MapR file system. This allows users
          to view the entire set of logs for a particular application
          using the HistoryServer UI or by running the yarn logs command.
