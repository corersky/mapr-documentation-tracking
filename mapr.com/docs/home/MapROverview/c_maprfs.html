MapR Filesystem

   The MapR Data Platform provides a unified data solution for structured
   data (tables) and unstructured data (files).

   MapR Filesystem is a random read-write distributed file system that
   allows applications to concurrently read and write directly to disk.
   The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), by contrast, has append-only
   writes and can only read from closed files. Because HDFS is layered
   over the existing Linux file system, a greater number of input/output
   (I/O) operations decrease the clusterâ€™s performance. MapR Filesystem
   also eliminates the Namenode associated with cluster failure in other
   Hadoop distributions, and enables special features for data management
   and high availability.

   The storage system architecture used by MapR Filesystem is written in
   C/C++ and prevents locking contention, eliminating performance impact
   from Java garbage collection.
   The following table highlights some of the MapR Filesystem features:
   Feature Description
   Storage pools A group of disks that MapR file system writes data to.
   Containers An abstract entity that stores files and directories in MapR
   file system. A container always belongs to exactly one volume and can
   hold namespace information, file chunks, or table chunks for the volume
   the container belongs to.
   CLDB A service that tracks the location of every container.
   Volumes A management entity that stores and organizes containers. Used
   to distribute metadata, set permissions on data in the cluster, and for
   data backup. A volume consists of a single name container and a number
   of data containers.
   Direct Access NFS Enables applications to read data and write data
   directly into the cluster.
   POSIX Clients The loopbacknfs and FUSE-based POSIX clients connect to
   one or more MapR clusters and allow app servers, web servers, and
   applications to write data directly and securely to the MapR cluster.
