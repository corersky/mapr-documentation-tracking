Hive Authorization

   MapR Data Platform has built-in platform authorization that protects
   all data regardless of the execution engine. This topic describes
   alternative authorization modes you can choose to implement.

   For more information, refer to [1]Authorization in MapR.

   In addition to the centralized authorization provided by the MapR Data
   Platform, you can use several authorization modes for Hive. The use
   cases and trade-offs for these authorization modes are described in the
   sections below.
