Using a White List with Fallback Hive Authorizer

   You can add an exception to Fallback Hive Authorizer restrictions using
   the hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist.append property.
   The hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist property is list
   of comma-separated Java regexes that you can append to. Appending to
   this list instead of updating the original list means that you can
   append to the default set by SQL-standard authorization instead of
   replacing it entirely.

   You can modify the configurations parameters that match these regexes
   when SQL-standard authorization is enabled.

   To get the default value, use the set <param> command. The
   hive.conf.restricted.list checks are still enforced after the
   white-list check.
   An example of a white-list configuration is as follows:
<property>
  <name>hive.security.authorization.sqlstd.confwhitelist.append</name>
  <value>hive.reloadable.aux.jars.path</value>
</property>

   After adding this configuration to the hive-site.xml file, execute the
   following command:
set hive.reloadable.aux.jars.path=/path/to/jar
