Hive and HCatalog Integration

   The [1]HCatalog library provides applications with a table view of the
   MapR Filesystem layer in your cluster, expanding your application's
   options from read/write data streams to add table operations such as
   get row and store row. The HCatalog library stores the metadata
   required for its operations in the Hive Metastore.

   The hcat utility can execute any of the data definition language (DDL)
   commands available in Hive that do not involve launching a MapReduce
   application. Internally, the hcat utility passes DDL commands to the
   hive program. Data stored in the MapR filesystem is serialized and
   deserialized through InputStorageFormats and OutputStorageFormats
   objects for records. Fields within a record are parsed with SerDes.
   Warning:

   The [2]hive-json-serde-0.2.jar JSON serializer/deserializer has not
   implemented a serialize() method and as a result does not function.

   The WebHCat server provides a REST-like web API for HCatalog. For more
   information about using WebHCat, see [3]Hive and WebHCat Integration.
