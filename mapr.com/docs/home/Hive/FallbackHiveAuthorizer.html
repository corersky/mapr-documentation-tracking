Fallback Hive Authorizer

   Fallback Hive Authorizer is used by Hive DDL (Data Definition Language)
   tasks for access control and for checking authorization from
   Driver.doAuthorization().

   It is designed to prevent [1]CVE-2018-11777.

   In addition to the centralized authorization provided by the MapR Data
   Platform, you can use several authorization modes for Hive. The use
   cases and trade-offs for these authorization modes are described in the
