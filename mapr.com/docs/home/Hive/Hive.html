Hive

   [Hive_logo.png]

   Apache Hiveâ„¢ is a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates
   easy data summarization, ad-hoc queries, and the analysis of large
   datasets stored in Hadoop-compatible file systems, such as the MapR
   Converged Data Platform. Hive provides a mechanism to project structure
   onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called
   HiveQL. At the same time this language also allows traditional
   map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and reducers
   when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in HiveQL.

   You can refer also to documentation available from the [1]Apache Hive
   project.

   Hive components include the following:
     * Hive Metastore
     * HiveServer2
     * HCatalog
     * WebHCat
     * Hive CLI
     * Beeline

   Note: If you installed Hive using the installer with the "Enable
   Security" check box selected, Hive is secured and no further
   configuration is required. However, if you installed Hive manually and
   wish to enable security for Hive, see [2]Hive Security Configuration
   Options for information.

   The following examples show how these components communicate with each
   other and when you might want to configure security features such as
   authentication and encryption:

Case 1: Jobs Submitted by the Hive CLI, Embedded Metastore

   In this case, all the information needed by Hive is contained within a
   single process, and no security is needed beyond that already provided
   by the JobClient's communications.

Case 2: Jobs Submitted by the Hive CLI, Remote Metastore

   In this case, Hive needs to access a metastore remote to Hive's process
   using a Thrift interface. This communication can be left non-secured,
   secured with Kerberos, or secured with MapR-SASL.

Case 3: Jobs Submitted by HiveServer2, Embedded Metastore

   In this case, JDBC or ODBC on a user's machine sends queries to
   HiveServer2, which submits the queries to the driver for parsing. The
   communication between JDBC and HIveServer2 can be secured with username
   and password with SSL, MapR-SASL, or with Kerberos. Either approach
   offers authentication and encryption. JDBC/ODBC can also be configured
   to use username and password without SSL, which offers authentication
   only.

   To use SSL from a client machine the ssl_truststore file must be copied
   from the cluster to the client.

Case 4: Jobs Submitted by HiveServer2, Remote Metastore

   In this case, JDBC or ODBC on a user's machine sends queries to
   HiveServer2, which submits the queries to the driver, which runs the
   query and returns the results. The metastore is remote. In this case,
   there are two communications links to secure: the Thrift interface
   between the metastore client and server, and the Thrift interface
   between the client JDBC/ODBC and HiveServer2. The security arrangements
   for these links are identical to Cases 2 and 3.
