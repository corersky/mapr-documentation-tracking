Configure HiveServer2 Clients to use Encryption

   Based on the encryption method, the requirements for clients to connect
   to HiveServer2 differ.
     * When HiveServer2 uses encryption with MapR-SASL or Kerberos
       authentication, the client must specify the same sasl qop value
       that is set for HiveServer2 (auth-conf is the default, recommended
       option).
     * When HiveServer2 uses SSL encryption without authentication, the
       client must specify a truststore. The ssl_truststore file must be
       copied from the cluster to the client. Specifying a truststore
       password is optional.
