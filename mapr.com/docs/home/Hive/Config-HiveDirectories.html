Configure Hive Directories

   You can configure the following Hive directories:
     * Hive Scratch Directory
     * Hive Warehouse Directory
     * Hive Error Logs Directory

Hive Scratch Directory

   In Hive 1.0, MapR configures the Hive scratch directory to be
   /user/<user.name>/tmp/hive/<user.name>. In Hive 0.13, the default
   scratch directory is /user/<user.name>/tmp/hive. The hive user must
   have write access to the /user folder.

   To modify this parameter, perform one of the following operations:
     * Set this parameter in the hive-site.xml.Copy the
       hive.exec.scratchdir property elements from the
       $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-default.xml.template file and paste them into
       an XML configuration element in the $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml
       file. Then, modify the value elements for these directories in the
       hive-site.xml file.
     * Set this parameter from the Hive shell. Example:
hive> set hive.exec.scratchdir=/myvolume/tmp

   Note: You will see better performance when queries import data from a
   table that is in the same MapR volume as Hive scratch directory.

How Hive Handles Scratch Directories on MapR

   When a query requires Hive to query existing tables and create data for
   new tables, Hive uses the following workflow:
    1. Create the query scratch directory hive_<timestamp>_<randomnumber>
       under the Hive scratch directory.
    2. Create the following directories as subdirectories of the scratch
       directory:
         a. Final query output directory. This directory's name takes the
            form -ext-<number>.
         b. An output directory for each MapReduce application. These
            directories' names take the form -mr-<number>.
    3. Hive executes the tasks, including MapReduce applications and
       loading data to the query output directory.
    4. Hive loads the data from output directory into a table. By default,
       the table's directory is in the /user/hive/warehouse directory. You
       can configure this location with the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir
       parameter in hive-site.xml, unless the table DDL specifies a custom
       location. Hive renames the output directory to the table directory
       in order to load the output data to the table.
    5. The scratch directories are automatically deleted after the query
       completes successfully.

   MapR uses [1]Administering Volumes, which are logical units that enable
   you to apply policies to a set of files, directories, and sub-volumes.
   When the output directory and the table directory are in different
   volumes, this workflow involves moving data across volumes. Moving data
   across volumes is slower than moving data within a volume. Therefore,
   MapR sets hive.optimize.insert.dest.volume to true to automatically
   create a scratch directory in the same volume as the target table.

Hive Warehouse Directory

   Hive tables are stored in the Hive warehouse directory. By default,
   MapR configures the Hive warehouse directory to be /user/hive/warehouse
   under the root volume. This default is defined in the
   $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-default.xml.template file.

   To modify this parameter, perform one of the following operations:
     * Set this parameter in the hive-site.xml.Copy the
       hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property elements from the
       $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-default.xml.template file and paste them into
       an XML configuration element in the $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml
       file. Then, modify the value elements for these directories in the
       hive-site.xml file.
     * Set this parameter from the Hive shell. Example:
hive> set hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=/myvolume/mydirectory

   Note: You will see better performance when queries move data between
   tables in the same volume.

Hive Error Logs Directory

   The log files are stored in /opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/logs/<user>
   by default.

   To modify the log location:
    1. Configure hive.log.dir in $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-log4j.properties
       file. Example:
hive.log.dir=<other_location>
    2. Set the sticky bit on the new directory. Example:
chmod 1777 <other_location>
