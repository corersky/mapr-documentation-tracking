Understanding Hive Authorization Modes

   Dfferent modes of Hive authorization are available to satisfy different
   use cases.

Secure by Default Configuration (Storage Based Authorization in the Metastore
Server)

   Hive default security configuration is the storage based authorization
   in the Metastore server. Managed by mapr-ti—Åkets and impersonation
   level, Hive configurations control the data access and MapR file system
   permissions act as one source of truth for the table storage access. By
   enabling storage based authorization in the metastore server, you can
   use this single source for truth and have a consistent data and
   metadata authorization policy.

   For use cases where the users have direct access to the data, Hive
   configurations do not control the data access. The MapR file system
   permissions act as the one source of truth for table storage access. To
   control metadata access on the metadata objects such as databases,
   tables, and partitions, MapR file system checks if you have permission
   to access the corresponding directories on the file system.

   You can also protect access through HiveServer2 ([1]use case 2.2) by
   ensuring that the queries run as the end user. The
   hive.server2.enable.doAs option should be true in the HiveServer2
   configuration, this is a default value.

   For more information, see [2]Hive Security Configuration Options.

SQL Standards Based Authorization in HiveServer2

   Although storage based authorization provides access control at the
   level of databases, tables, and partitions, it can only control
   authorization at finer levels such as columns and views for MapR
   Database tables and not for files because the access control provided
   by the file system is at the level of directory and files. SQL
   standards authorization makes authorization possible for files BUT at
   the expense of not being able to enforce that access from any other
   tool.

   For enabling SQL standards based authorization, refer to [3]SQL
   Standards-Based Hive Authorization.

Legacy Hive Authorization

   Old default authorization is the authorization mode that has been
   available in earlier versions of Hive. However, this mode does not have
   a complete access control model, leaving many security gaps
   unaddressed.

   For example, the permissions needed to grant privileges for a user are
   not defined, and any user can grant themselves access to a table or
   database.

   This model is similar to the SQL standards based authorization mode, in
   that it provides grant or revoke statement-based access control.
   However, the access control policy is different from SQL standards
   based authorization, and they are not compatible. Use of this mode is
   also supported for Hive command line users. However, for reasons
   mentioned under the discussion of SQL standards based authorization, it
   is not a secure mode of authorization for the Hive command line.
