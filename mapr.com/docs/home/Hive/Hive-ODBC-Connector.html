Using ODBC to Connect to HiveServer2

   This section contains details about setting up and using the ODBC
   Connector for Hive.

Before You Begin

   The MapR Hive ODBC Connector is an ODBC driver for Apache Hive 0.7.0
   and later that complies with the ODBC 3.52 specification. You can
   download the Hive ODBC connector from
   [1]https://package.mapr.com/tools/MapR-ODBC/MapR_Hive/. After
   downloading the driver, refer to documentation for [2]Hive ODBC Driver
   to install and configure the driver.

   The [3]Hive ODBC Driver supports the following Advanced Options:
     * Enable Auto Reconnect
     * Driver Config Take Precedence
     * Fast SQL Prepare
     * Get Tables With Query
     * Invalid Session Auto Recover
     * Show System Table
     * Socket Timeout
     * Default String Column Length
     * Rows Fetched Per Block
     * Use Native Query

   To use the ODBC driver, configure a Data Source Name (DSN), a
   definition that specifies how to connect to Hive. DSNs are typically
   managed by the operating system and may be used by multiple
   applications. Some applications do not use DSNs. You will need to refer
   to your particular applicationâ€™s documentation to understand how it
   connects using ODBC.

   The standard query language for ODBC is SQL. HiveQL, the standard query
   language for Hive, includes a subset of ANSI SQL-92. Applications that
   connect to Hive using ODBC may need queries altered if the queries use
   SQL features that are not present in Hive. Applications that use SQL
   will recognize HiveQL, but might not provide access to HiveQL-specific
   features such as multi-table insert.

   Please refer to the [4]Hive Language Manual for up-to-date information
   on HiveQL.

The SQL Connector

   The SQL Connector feature translates standard SQL-92 queries into
   equivalent HiveQL queries. The SQL Connector performs syntactical
   translations and structural transformations. For example:
     * Quoted Identifiers: When quoting identifiers, HiveQL uses back
       quotes (`), while SQL uses double quotes ("). Even when a driver
       reports the back quote as the quote character, some applications
       still generate double-quoted identifiers.
     * Table Aliases: HiveQL does not support the AS keyword between a
       table reference and its alias.
     * The JOIN, INNER JOIN, and CROSS JOIN SQL syntaxes are translated to
       the HiveQL JOIN syntax.
     * SQL TOP N queries are transformed to HiveQL LIMIT queries.
