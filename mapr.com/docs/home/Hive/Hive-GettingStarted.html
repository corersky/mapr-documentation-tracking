Getting Started with Hive

   In this tutorial, you'll create a Hive table, load data from a
   tab-delimited text file, and run a couple of basic queries against the
   table. For details on setting up HiveServer2 and starting BeeLine, see
   [1]Using JDBC or Beeline to Connect to HiveServer2.
   Note: If you are using HiveServer2, you will use the BeeLine CLI
   instead of the Hive shell, as shown below.

Take a look at the source data

   First, take a look at the contents of the file using the terminal:
    1. Save the following data to a text file named sample-table.txt:
       The sample-table.txt table columns are delimited by tabs:
1320352532  1001  http://www.mapr.com/doc  http://www.mapr.com  192.168.10.1
1320352533  1002  http://www.mapr.com  http://www.example.com  192.168.10.10
1320352546  1001  http://www.mapr.com  http://www.mapr.com/doc  192.168.10.1
       If you are working on the MapR Virtual Machine, we'll be loading
       the file from the MapR Virtual Machine's local file system (not the
       cluster storage layer), so save the file in the MapR Home directory
       (for example, /home/mapr).
    2. Make sure you are in the Home directory where you saved
       sample-table.txt (type cd ~ if you are not sure).
    3. Type cat sample-table.txt to display the following output.

mapr@mapr-desktop:~$ cat sample-table.txt
1320352532 1001 http://www.mapr.com/doc http://www.mapr.com 192.168.10.1
1320352533 1002 http://www.mapr.com http://www.example.com 192.168.10.10
1320352546 1001 http://www.mapr.com http://www.mapr.com/doc 192.168.10.1

   Notice that the file consists of only three lines, each of which
   contains a row of data fields separated by the TAB character. The data
   in the file represents a web log.

Create a table in Hive and load the source data:

    1. Type the following command to start the Hive shell, using
       tab-completion to expand the <version>:
/opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/bin/hive
    2. At the hive> prompt, type the following command to create the
       table:
CREATE TABLE web_log(viewTime INT, userid BIGINT, url STRING, referrer STRING, i
p STRING) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
    3. Type the following command to load the data from sample-table.txt
       into the table:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/mapr/sample-table.txt' INTO TABLE web_log;

Run basic queries against the table

     * Try the simplest query, one that displays all the data in the
       table:
SELECT web_log.* FROM web_log;
       This query would be inadvisable with a large table, but with the
       small sample table it returns very quickly.
     * Try a simple SELECT to extract only data that matches a desired
       string:
SELECT web_log.* FROM web_log WHERE web_log.url LIKE '%doc';
       This query launches a MapReduce application to filter the data.
