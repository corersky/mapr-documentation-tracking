Hive ODBC Connector on Windows

   There are versions of the connector for 32-bit and 64-bit applications.
   The 64-bit version of the connector works only with 64-bit DSNs; the
   32-bit connector works only with 32-bit DSNs. Because 64-bit Windows
   machines can run both 64-bit and 32-bit applications, install both
   versions of the connector in order to set up DSNs to work with both
   types of applications. If both the 32-bit connector and the 64-bit
   connector are installed, you must configure DSNs for each
   independently, in their separate Data Source Administrators.
