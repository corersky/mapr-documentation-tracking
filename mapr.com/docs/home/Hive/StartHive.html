Starting Hive

   You can start the Hive shell from HIVE_HOME/bin/ with the hive command.
   Example:
/opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/bin/hive

   When the Hive shell starts, it reads an initialization file called
   .hiverc which is located in the HIVE_HOME/bin/ or $HOME/ directories.
   You can edit this file to set custom parameters or commands that
   initialize the Hive command-line environment, one command per line.

   When you run the Hive shell, you can specify a MySQL initialization
   script file using the -i option. Example:
/opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/bin/hive -i <filename>
