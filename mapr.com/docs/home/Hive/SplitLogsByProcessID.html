Splitting Hive Logs into HiveServer2 and Metastore logs by Process ID

   You can split Hive log files into HiveServer2 and Metestore log files
   by process ID.
   To enable this feature, you must create a hive-log4j2.properties file,
   if one does not already exist, and then edit it:
    1. If the hive-log4j2.properties file does not exist, create it from
       the template:
cp /opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/conf/hive-log4j2.properties.template  /opt/mapr
/hive/hive-<version>/conf/hive-log4j2.properties
    2. Edit the hive-log4j2.properties file to replace Daily Rolling File
       Appender (DRFA) with the routing appender:
#property.hive.root.logger = DRFA
property.hive.root.logger = routing
#appenders = console, DRFA
appenders = console, routing
    3. Restart Hive services.

   The resultant Hive log structure is as follows:
   The HiveServer2 log is located at:
${HIVE_HOME}/log/<ADMIN_USER>/<ADMIN_USER>-hiveserver2-<HOSTNAME>.log.<PID>@<HOS
TNAME>

   Where:
     * ${HIVE_HOME} is the home folder for Hive.
     * <ADMIN_USER> is the administrator user of the cluster. Typically,
       mapr.
     * <HOSTNAME> is the host where HiveServer2 log file is placed.
     * <PID> is the process ID of HiveServer2.

   The Metastore log is located at:
${HIVE_HOME}/log/<ADMIN_USER>/<ADMIN_USER>-metastore-<HOSTNAME>.log.<PID>@<HOSTN
AME>

   Where:
     * ${HIVE_HOME} is the home folder for Hive.
     * <ADMIN_USER> is the administrator user of the cluster. Typically,
       mapr.
     * <HOSTNAME> is the host where Hive Metastore log file is placed.
     * <PID> is the process ID of Hive Metastore.

Logging CLI session

   After splitting logs for HiveServer2 and Hive Metastore, CLI log
   appears separately for each CLI session at
   ${HIVE_HOME}/logs/<USERNAME>.
   A log file is created for every launched CLI session:
${HIVE_HOME}/log/<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>-hiveserver2-<HOSTNAME>.log.<PID>@<HOSTNAM
E>

   Where <PID> is process identifier of the CLI session.

Logging into Default Log Files

   After daemons of HiveServer2 and Hive Metastore are started, log data
   is collected into files:
${HIVE_HOME}/log/<ADMIN_USER>/<ADMIN_USER>-hiveserver2-<HOSTNAME>.log.<PID>@<HOS
TNAME>

   and
${HIVE_HOME}/log/<ADMIN_USER>/<ADMIN_USER>-metastore-<HOSTNAME>.log.<PID>@<HOSTN
AME>

   Where <PID> is process identifier of the CLI session.
   A default log file is created for HiveServer2:
${HIVE_HOME}/log/<ADMIN_USER>/<ADMIN_USER>-hiveserver2-<HOSTNAME>.log-default

   and Hive Metastore:
${HIVE_HOME}/log/<ADMIN_USER>/<ADMIN_USER>-metastore-<HOSTNAME>.log-default

   All the latest logs for HiveServer2 and Hive Metastore can be found at
   the default log files (with prefix -default). When daemons of
   HiveServer2 and hive Metastore are successfully started, no information
   is added to <ADMIN_USER>-hiveserver2-<HOSTNAME>.log.<PID>@<HOSTNAME> or
   <ADMIN_USER>-metastore-<HOSTNAME>.log.<PID>@<HOSTNAME>.
