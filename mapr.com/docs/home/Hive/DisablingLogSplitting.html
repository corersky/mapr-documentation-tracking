Disabling Log Splitting

   You can disable splitting Hive log files into HiveServer2 and Metastore
   log files.

   For all logs to be written to the hive.log file, perform the following
   steps:
    1. Edit the hive-env.sh file to set SPLIT_HIVE_LOGS_INTO_FILES
       property to FALSE:
export SPLIT_HIVE_LOGS_INTO_FILES=”false”
       Note: Set the SPLIT_HIVE_LOGS_INTO_FILES property to true or
       comment out this property and restart Hive services to restore
       default behavior from your previous Hive log configuration.
    2. Restart Hive services.
