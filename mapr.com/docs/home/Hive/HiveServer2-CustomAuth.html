Configure HiveServer 2 to use Custom Authentication

    1. Create a custom Authenticator class derived from the following
       interface:
public interface PasswdAuthenticationProvider {
  /**
   * The Authenticate method is called by the HiveServer2 authentication layer
   * to authenticate users for their requests.
   * If a user is to be granted, return nothing/throw nothing.
   * When a user is to be disallowed, throw an appropriate {@link Authentication
Exception}.
   *
   * For an example implementation, see {@link LdapAuthenticationProviderImpl}.
   *
   * @param user - The username received over the connection request
   * @param password - The password received over the connection request
   * @throws AuthenticationException - When a user is found to be
   * invalid by the implementation
   */
  void Authenticate(String user, String password) throws AuthenticationException
;
}
       The [1]SampleAuthenticator.java code has an example implementation
       that has stored usernames and passwords.
    2. Configure the following properties in the hive-site.xml file on
       each node where HiveServer2 is installed:

   CAPTION:

   Property Value
   hive.server2.authentication CUSTOM
   hive.server2.custom.authentication.class The authentication class name.
   For example, hive.server2.custom.authentication.class
<property>
<name>hive.server2.authentication</name>
<value>CUSTOM</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>hive.server2.custom.authentication.class</name>
<value>hive.test.SampleAuthenticator</value>
</property>
    3. Restart Hiveserver2 to apply the changes:
maprcli node services -name hs2 -action restart -nodes <comma separated list of
nodes>
