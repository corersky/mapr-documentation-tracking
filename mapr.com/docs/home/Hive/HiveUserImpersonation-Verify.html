Verify that User Impersonation is Enabled

   To verify that Hive queries do not run as the mapr user, connect to
   hiveserver2 as a user other than mapr. Then, run queries and verify
   that queries were run as the user that connected to hiveserver2.

   To verify that hadoop commands submitted by Hive do not run as the mapr
   user, start the shell or hiveserver2 as a user other than mapr. Then,
   create some tables and verify that the tables in /user/hive/warehouse
   are created under the user that started the shell or hiveserver2.
