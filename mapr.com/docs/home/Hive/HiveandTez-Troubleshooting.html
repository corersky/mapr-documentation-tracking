Known Issues and Restrictions

   Sqoop importing data into Hive fails when the entire cluster is
          configured to use Tez.
          This is because of Sqoop's incompatibility with Tez.

          Workaround: Do not configure the entire cluster to use Tez.

   Percentage sampling is not supported in
          org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat.
          Hive uses org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat by
          default and so queries like 'SELECT * FROM tablename
          TABLESAMPLE(20 percent);' will not work for Hive on Tez.

          Workaround: Instead of
          org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat, use
          org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat.

          To change input format, do one of the following:

          + Set hive.tez.input.format in hive shell. For example:
hive> set hive.tez.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFor
mat;
          + Add org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat to
            hive-site.xml file. For example:
<property>
  <name>hive.tez.input.format</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat</value>
</property>

   Hive on Tez does not work well with Sequence Files Schema changes
          TEZ-2741

   Limitations with common joins
          HIVE-11693: The CommonMergeJoinOperator only sets big table
          position when it has inputs for big table. If the input is
          empty, the method is not called.

   HiveServer2 on Tez doesn't support concurrent queries within one
          session
          HIVE-9223: When multiple queries are submitted in the same HS2
          session concurrently, some queries fail with an error.

   Tez upgrade issues

          + No support for preserving configuration from MEP-5.0.0 and
            MEP-4.1.1 (ECO-1803) to MEP-6.0.0(1808) or MEP-5.0.1(1808) on
            Ubuntu.
          + No support for preserving Tomcat configuration from previous
            MEPs to MEP-6.0.0 (1808).
          + You should manually stop the Tomcat service and delete the
            tomcat folder as a precondition if you are updating or
            upgrading Tez from the following MEPs:
            MEP-4.0.0
            MEP-4.1.0
