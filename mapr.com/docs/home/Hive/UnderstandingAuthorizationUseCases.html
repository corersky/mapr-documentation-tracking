Understanding Hive Authorization Use Cases

   Table Storage Layer and SQL Query Engine are the two primary use cases
   for client-based authorization protection, delivered as part of the
   open source project.

Use Case 1: Table Storage Layer

   This is the use case for Hive [1]HCatalog API users.

   In this case, Hive provides a table abstraction and metadata for files
   on storage (typically MapR file system). You have direct access to MapR
   file system and the metastore server (which provides an API for
   metadata access).

   MapR file system access is authorized through the use of MapR file
   system [2]permissions. You need to authorize metadata access using Hive
   configuration.

Use Case 2: SQL Query Engine

   This is one of the most common use cases of Hive. This is the "Hive
   view" of SQL users and BI tools. This use case has the following two
   subcategories:
     * Hive command line users - You have direct access to MapR file
       system and the Hive metastore, which makes this use case similar to
       use case 1.
     * ODBC/JDBC and other HiveServer2 API users (Beeline CLI is an
       example) - You have all data or metadata access through
       HiveServer2. You do not have direct access to MapR file system or
       the metastore.
