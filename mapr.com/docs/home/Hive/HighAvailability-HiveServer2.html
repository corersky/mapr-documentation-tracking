Enabling High Availability for HiveServer2

   Perform the following steps to enable High Availability for
   HiveServer2.

Configuring Hive

    1. Modify the warden.hs2.conf file as shown below on all the nodes
       where Hive is installed.
services=hs2:all
    2. Add the following properties to the hive-site.xml file on all the
       nodes where HiveServer2 is installed.

   CAPTION:

   Property Value Description
   hive.server2.support.dynamic.service.discovery true (default is false)
   Set to true to enable HiveServer2 dynamic service discovery for its
   clients.
   hive.server2.zookeeper.namespace hiveserver2 (default value) The parent
   node in ZooKeeper, which is used by HiveServer2 when supporting dynamic
   service discovery.
   hive.zookeeper.quorum <hostname>:5181,<hostname>:5181,<hostname>:5181
   List of ZooKeeper servers to talk to. Used in connection string by
   JDBC/ODBC clients instead of URI of specific HiveServer2 instance.
   hive.zookeeper.client.port 5181 (default value) The port of the
   ZooKeeper servers to talk to. If the list of Zookeeper servers
   specified in hive.zookeeper.quorum does not contain port numbers and
   so, this value is used.
   hive.zookeeper.session.timeout 600000 (default value) Zookeeper
   client's session timeout value. The client is disconnected, and as a
   result, all locks are released if a heartbeat is not sent within the
   timeout period.
    3. Restart all the nodes where Hive service is installed after
       updating the configuration.

Connecting with JDBC/ODBC Clients

   Connect to HiveServer2 with JDBC/ODBC clients using the following
   connection string:
jdbc:hive2://<zookeeper_ensemble>/;serviceDiscoveryMode=zooKeeper;
zooKeeperNamespace=<hiveserver2_zookeeper_namespace>

   Here:
   <zookeeper_ensemble> Specifies a comma-separated list of ZooKeeper
   servers that form the ensemble. For example:
   <zk_host1>:<zk_port1>,<zk_host2>:<zk_port2>,<zk_host3>:<zk_port3>.
   <hiveserver2_zookeeper_namespace> Specifies the namespace on Zookeeper
   under which HiveServer2 znodes are added. The namespace value is
   configured in hive.server2.zookeeper.name space.

Deregistering HiveServer2 Instances from Zookeeper

   Remove a HiveServer2 instance from Zookeeper by running the following
   commands (in the ZooKeeper command line interface) to deregister the
   server.
    1. Launch the ZooKeeper command line interface and get the HiveServer2
       znode by running the following commands:
/opt/mapr/zookeeper/zookeeper-<version>/bin/zkCli.sh -server <ip:port of zookeep
er instance>
ls /<hive.server2.zookeeper.namespace>
    2. Run the command to deregister HiveServer2. To deregister:
          + A particular HiveServer2, run the following command:
delete  serverUri=<hostname:port>;version=<hive version>;sequence=<sequence numb
er>
            After you deregister the HiverServer2 from Zookeeper, it will
            not return the deregistered HiveServer2 for new client
            connections. However, active client sessions are not affected
            by deregistering the HiveServer2 from Zookeeper.
          + All HiveServer2 instances of a particular version, run the
            following command:
hive --service hiveserver2 --deregister <version_number>
