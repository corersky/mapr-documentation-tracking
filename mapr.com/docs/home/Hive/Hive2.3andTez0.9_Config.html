Configuring Hive 2.3 and Tez 0.9

   To configure Hive on Tez, repeat the following steps on each node where
   you want to configure Hive on Tez. Tez mode for MR jobs is not
   compatible with all MR jobs and so, do not set up the whole cluster to
   work on Tez.

   On Ubuntu, while configuring the new version of Hive, you could have an
   issue caused by an incomplete removal of previously installed Hive
   packages. To avoid this issue, use the purge command for complete
   removal of all previously installed Hive packages.
    1. Install Tez 0.9 if it is already not installed.
       To install, run the following command:

       On CentOS / RedHat yum install mapr-tez
       On SUSE            zypper install mapr-tez
       On Ubuntu          apt-get install mapr-tez
    2. Create the /apps/tez directory on MapR file system.
       To create, run the following commands:
hadoop fs -mkdir /apps
hadoop fs -mkdir /apps/tez
    3. Upload the Tez libraries to the tez directory on MapR file system.
       To upload, run the following commands:
hadoop fs -put /opt/mapr/tez/tez-0.9 /apps/tez
hadoop fs -chmod -R 755 /apps/tez
    4. Verify the upload.
       To verify, run the following command:
hadoop fs -ls /apps/tez/tez-0.9
    5. Set the Tez environment variables. To set, open the
       /opt/mapr/hive/hive-2.3/conf/hive-env.sh file, add the following
       lines, and save the file:
export TEZ_CONF_DIR=/opt/mapr/tez/tez-0.9/conf
export TEZ_JARS=/opt/mapr/tez/tez-0.9/*:/opt/mapr/tez/tez-0.9/lib/*
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$TEZ_CONF_DIR:$TEZ_JARS:$HADOOP_CLASSPATH
       Note: Repeat this step on each node where you want Hive on Tez to
       be configured.
    6. Configure Hive for Tez engine. To configure, open the
       /opt/mapr/hive/hive-2.3/conf/hive-site.xml file, add the following
       lines, and save the file.
<property>
  <name>hive.execution.engine</name>
  <value>tez</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hive.exec.pre.hooks</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.hooks.ATSHook</value>
</property>
       Add the hive.exec.post.hooks property with value
       org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.hooks.ATSHook to use the Hive queries
       page in the Tez UI.
<property>
  <name>hive.exec.post.hooks</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.hooks.ATSHook</value>
</property>
       Note: Repeat this step on each node where you want Hive on Tez to
       be configured.
    7. Run configure.sh with the -R option.
/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh -R
       Note: Starting in MEP 6.0.1 and above, Tez should be configured by
       running the $MAPR_HOME/server/configure.sh script with the -R
       option.
