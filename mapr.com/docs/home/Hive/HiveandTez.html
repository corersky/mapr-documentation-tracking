Hive 2.1 and Tez 0.8

   You can use Tez, instead of MapReduce, for generic data processing
   tasks. Tez significantly increases the processing speed. Tez, working
   with Hive, provides smaller latency for interactive queries and higher
   throughput for batch queries. Some key improvements include:
     * Added UDF aes_encrypt and aes_decrypt functions for encrypting and
       decrypting input using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
       Oracle JRE supports AES-128 out of the box; AES-192 and AES-256 are
       supported if Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
       Jurisdiction Policy Files are installed.
     * Added banker's rounding BROUND UDF.
       With banker's rounding, the value is rounded to the nearest even
       number. Also known as "Gaussian rounding", and, in German,
       "mathematische Rundung".
     * ORC file dump in JSON format.
       ORC file dump uses custom format. Will be useful to dump ORC
       metadata in json format so that other tools can be built on top it.
     * Provided a way for developers/users to modify the numRows and
       dataSize for a table/partition.
       Although they are part of the table properties, in prior versions,
       they were set to -1 when the task did not come from a statsTask.

   MapR Hive on Tez also includes the following:
     * Dynamically partitioned hash join for Tez.
     * Support for aggregate push down through joins.
     * DBTokenStore support to HS2 delegation token.
     * Hive View Column Authorization.
     * UDF substring_index function that returns the substring from string
       str before count occurrences of the delimiter.
     * QUARTER(data/time/string) function that returns the quarter of the
       year for a date, timestamp, or string in the range 1 to 4.
     * Support for limited integer type promotion in ORC.
     * Possibility for Hive Parser to support multi col in clause (x,y..)
       in ((..),..., ()).
     * Support of special characters in quoted table names.
     * Support for "show create database".
     * Support escaping carriage return and new line for LazySimpleSerDe.
     * Support vectorizing when the input format is TEXTFILE and other
       formats for better Map Vertex performance.
     * Support for NULLS FIRST/NULLS LAST.
       The NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST options can be used to determine
       whether nulls appear before or after non-null data values when the
       ORDER BY clause is used.
     * Supports aggregate functions in over clause.

   The following features are available for experimental use and not
   recommended for use in production:
     * Command to kill an ACID transaction.
       This cleans up all state related to this transaction. The initiator
       of this (if still alive) will get an error trying to
       heartbeat/commit and will become aware that the transaction failed.
     * Hive Hybrid Procedural SQL On Hadoop (HPL/SQL).
       Hive Hybrid Procedural SQL On Hadoop (HPL/SQL), which is available
       in Hive 2.1, is a tool that implements procedural SQL for Hive.
       HPL/SQL is an open source tool that implements procedural SQL
       language for Apache Hive, SparkSQL, Impala, as well as any other
       SQL-on-Hadoop implementation, any NoSQL, and any RDBMS.
       HPL/SQL is a hybrid and heterogeneous language that understands
       syntaxes and semantics of almost any existing procedural SQL
       dialect, and you can use with any database (for example, running
       existing Oracle PL/SQL code on Apache Hive and Microsoft SQL
       Server, or running Transact-SQL on Oracle, Cloudera Impala, or
       Amazon Redshift).
       Note: Create the hplsql-site.xml file to configure HPL/SQL feature.
       See [1]http://www.hplsql.org/configuration for more information.

   MapR does not support:
     * Hive on Spark
       You cannot use Spark as an execution engine for Hive. However, you
       can run Hive and Spark on the same cluster. You can also use Spark
       SQL and Drill to query Hive tables.
     * HDFS encryption in Hive tables
     * Hbase-0.9X with Hive-2.1
       Only Hbase-1.X is compatible with Hive-2.1.
     * LLAP with Hive-2.1 since Apache Slider is not in the MapR ecosystem
     * Apache Knox and Apache Ranger
       HiveServer2 HTTP mode is not available with X-Forwarded-Host header
       for authorization/audits.
     * Masking and filtering of rows/columns since Apache Ranger is not in
       the MapR ecosystem.
