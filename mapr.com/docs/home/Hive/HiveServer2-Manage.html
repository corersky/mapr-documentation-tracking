Managing Hiveserver2

   Hiveserver2 is started automatically at installation time by the warden
   if the mapr-hiveserver2 package is installed. It is sometimes necessary
   to start or stop the service (for example, after changing the
   configuration). You can start and stop Hiveserver2 in two ways:
     * Using the maprcli node services command - Using this command, you
       can start Hiveserver2 on multiple nodes at one time.
     * Using the MapR Control System
