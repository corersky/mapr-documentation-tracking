Hive and MapR Database Integration

   You can create MapR Database binary tables from Hive that can be
   accessed by both Hive and MapR Database. You can run Hive queries on
   MapR Database binary tables, convert existing MapR Database binary
   tables into Hive-MapR Database tables, and run Hive queries on those
   tables as well.
