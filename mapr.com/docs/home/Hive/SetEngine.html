Setting the Execution Engine

   Consider the following definitions:
     * Runtime — execution time of job.
     * Session time — time from the start of Hive shell or Beeline until
       you exit.

   You can change the execution engine during a session (session time),
   but not while executing job in the session (runtime). If you specify
   the execution engine before starting the job, it will override the
   hive.execution.engine property in hive-site.xml file. For example, to
   specify the execution engine:
hive> set hive.execution.engine=tez;
hive> *perform some query here*

   If you open another session of hive shell or beeline, you will not see
   the setting in the session from before and you can set needed
   properties for every session.
