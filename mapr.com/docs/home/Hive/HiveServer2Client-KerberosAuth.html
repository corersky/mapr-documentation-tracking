Configure HiveServer 2 Clients to use Kerberos

   When HiveServer 2 is configured to use Kerberos authentication, you
   must also configure HiveServer2 clients to use Kerberos.
   On each node where HiveServer2 clients (not including Beeline) are
   installed, reconfigure the following option in env.sh
   (/opt/mapr/conf/env.sh) file:

   CAPTION:

               Existing Configuration             Required Configuration
   MAPR_HIVE_LOGIN_OPTS="-Dhadoop.login=maprsasl"
MAPR_HIVE_LOGIN_OPTS="-Dhadoop.login=hybrid"

   Note: This configuration is listed in the portion of the file that
   begins with if [ "$MAPR_SECURITY_STATUS" = "true" ];. However, you
   should make the change in the /opt/mapr/conf/env_override.sh file. For
   more information, see [1]About env_override.sh.
   On each node where Beeline is installed, reconfigure the following
   option in beeline.sh ($hive_home/bin/ext/beeline.sh) file:

   CAPTION:

                 Existing Configuration              Required Configuration
   HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS${MAPR_HIVE_LOGIN_OPTS}"
HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS${KERBEROS_LOGIN_OPTS}"

   For more information, see [2]Connecting to Hive.
   Note: The MAPR_HIVE_LOGIN_OPTS and MAPR_HIVE_SERVER_LOGIN_OPTS were
   added in 1504 release of Hive 0.13 and Hive 1.0. If you have Hive 0.13
   from a prior release, you do not need to configure these properties.
   Instead, set MAPR_ECOSYSTEM_LOGIN_OPTS and
   MAPR_ECOSYSTEM_SERVER_LOGIN_OPTS to "-Dhadoop.login=hybrid" in
   /opt/mapr/conf/env.sh.
