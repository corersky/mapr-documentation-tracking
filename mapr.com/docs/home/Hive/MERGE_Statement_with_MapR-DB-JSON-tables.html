Understanding the MERGE Statement

   You can use the MERGE statement to efficiently perform record-level
   INSERT and UPDATE operations within Hive tables.

   The MERGE statement can be a key tool of MapR cluster data management.
   It is based on ANSI-standard SQL.
   The MERGE statement is described by the following scenarios:
     * [1]Simple merge.maprdb.column.id is the join key
     * [2]Simple merge.maprdb.column.id is not the join key
     * [3]Deleting while merging
     * [4]Multiple source rows match a given target row (cardinality
       violation)
     * [5]Merge on mixed data types
     * [6]Merge into external MapR Database JSON tables
     * [7]Merge into partitioned MapR Database JSON tables
     * [8]Merge into temporary MapR Database JSON tables

Simple merge.maprdb.column.id is the join key

   Consider merging the following example source and target tables:

   CAPTION: Table 1. customer_source

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 Dorothi    Hogward   7777
   002 Alex       Bowee     7777
   088 Robert     Dowson    25

   CAPTION: Table 2. customer_db_json_target

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 John       Smith     45
   002 Michael    Watson    27
   003 Den        Brown     33
   You can use the following SQL-standard MERGE statement:
MERGE into customer_db_json_target trg
USING customer_source src
ON src.id = trg.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET age = src.age
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
INSERT VALUES (src.id, src.first_name, src.last_name, src.age);

   The result is:
   id  first_name last_name age
   001 John       Smith     7777
   002 Michael    Watson    7777
   003 Den        Brown     33
   088 Robert     Dowson    25
   Note: The age column is updated and a new id column is inserted.

Simple merge.maprdb.column.id is not the join key

   Merging when merge.maprdb.column is not the join key is not
   recommended.

Deleting while merging

   Deletions are not supported in a MERGE statement. This example:
MERGE INTO  customer_db_json old
USING customer_new new ON new.id = old.id
WHEN MATCHED AND old.age > 10 THEN DELETE;

   Will raise the following exception:
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException Deletes are no
t supported for MapR DB JSON tables (state=42000,code=40000)

Multiple source rows match a given target row (cardinality violation)

   Consider merging the two tables customer_db_json and customer_new:

   CAPTION: Table 3. customer_db_json

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 John       Smith     45
   002 Michael    Watson    27
   003 Den        Brown     33

   And:

   CAPTION: Table 4. customer_new

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 Dorothi    Hogward   77
   001 Dorothi    Hogward   77
   088 Robert     Dowson    25
   To MERGE customer_new and customer_db_json:
MERGE INTO customer_db_json trg
USING customer_new src ON src.id = trg.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE
SET first_name = src.first_name,
last_name = src.last_name
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES
(src.id, src.first_name, src.last_name, src.age);

   This example causes an exception because of duplicate values in the id
   column in the customer_new table:
Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: Error evaluating ca
rdinality_violation(_col0)

   To avoid cardinality violation, set hive.merge.cardinality.check=false,
   but in this case the result is unpredictable because there is no rule
   which defines the order of duplicated data that will be inserted while
   using the MERGE statement.

Merge on mixed data types

   The merge operation also supports mixed data types, such as arrays,
   maps, and structures.

   Consider two tables mixed_types_source and mixed_types_target:

   CAPTION: Table 5. mixed_types_source

   doc_id                           user_info
   1      {"name":"Brandon","surname":"Lee","age":31,"gender":"MALE"}
   2      {"name":"Johnson","surname":"Fall","age":23,"gender":"MALE"}
   3      {"name":"Mary","surname":"Dowson","age":11,"gender":"FEMALE"}
   4      {"name":"Paul","surname":"Rodgers","age":41,"gender":"MALE"}

   And:

   CAPTION: Table 6. mixed_types_target

   id                           user_info
   1  {"name":"Lexx","surname":"Comfuzer","age":31,"gender":"MALE"}
   To merge mixed_types_source and mixed_types_target:
MERGE INTO mixed_types_target trg
USING mixed_types_source src
ON src.doc_id = old.doc_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE
SET user_info = src.user_info
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES
(src.doc_id, src.user_info);

   The result is:

   CAPTION: Table 7. Result of MERGE operator

   id                          first_name
   1  {"name":"Brandon","surname":"Lee","age":31,"gender":"MALE"}
   2  {"name":"Johnson","surname":"Fall","age":23,"gender":"MALE"}
   3  {"name":"Mary","surname":"Dowson","age":11,"gender":"FEMALE"}
   4  {"name":"Paul","surname":"Rodgers","age":41,"gender":"MALE"}
   It is important to note that you cannot update only a part of a complex
   structure field. For example, you have a structure stored as one field
   in a Hive table:
{"name":"Johnson","surname":"Fall","age":23,"gender":"MALE"}

   You cannot update only the age field in the structure. You can only
   replace all values of the structure with new ones. See [9]Understanding
   the UPDATE Statement for details.

Merge into external MapR Database JSON tables

   The MERGE operator is also available for external MapR Database JSON
   tables. You can use the MERGE statement to insert and update values in
   external MapR database JSON table targets.

Merge into partitioned MapR Database JSON tables

   Partitioned MapR Database JSON tables are not supported.

Merge into temporary MapR Database JSON tables

   The MERGE operator is also available for temporary MapR Database JSON
   tables. Use temporary tables as target tables for merge. No additional
   syntax is needed.
