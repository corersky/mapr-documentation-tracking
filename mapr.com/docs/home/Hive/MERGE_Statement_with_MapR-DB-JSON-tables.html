Understanding the MERGE Statement

   This section describes how to use the MERGE statement to efficiently
   perform record-level INSERT and UPDATE operations within Hive tables.

   The MERGE statement can be a key tool of MapR cluster data management.
   It is based on ANSI-standard SQL.
   This feature is described by the following topics:
     * [1]Simple merge.maprdb.column.id is the join key
     * [2]Simple merge.maprdb.column.id is not the join key
     * [3]Deleting while merging
     * [4]Multiple source rows match a given target row (cardinality
       violation)
     * [5]Merge on mixed data types
     * [6]Merge into external MapR Database JSON tables
     * [7]Merge into partitioned MapR Database JSON tables
     * [8]Merge into temporary MapR Database JSON tables

Simple merge.maprdb.column.id is the join key

   Consider two tables customer_source and customer_db_json_target. See
   Table 1 for source table customer_source:

   CAPTION: Table 1. Source table customer_source

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 Dorothi    Hogward   7777
   002 Alex       Bowee     7777
   088 Robert     Dowson    25

   See Table 2 for target table customer_db_json_target:

   CAPTION: Table 2. Target table customer_db_json_target

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 John       Smith     45
   002 Michael    Watson    27
   003 Den        Brown     33
   The following SQL statement is an example of valid MERGE usage:
MERGE into customer_db_json_target trg
USING customer_source src
ON src.id = trg.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET age = src.age
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
INSERT VALUES (src.id, src.first_name, src.last_name, src.age);

   The result after merge into target is:

   CAPTION: Table 3. Result of MERGE operator

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 John       Smith     7777
   002 Michael    Watson    7777
   003 Den        Brown     33
   088 Robert     Dowson    25
   Note: The age column is updated and a new id column is inserted.

Simple merge.maprdb.column.id is not the join key

   This type of join is not recommended. Consider two tables
   client_mapr_db_json_target and client_source:

   CAPTION: Table 4. Contents of client_mapr_db_json_target

   id first_name last_name age
   1  John       Robin     32
   2  Martin     Maxx      40
   3  Lee        Harwin    25

   And:

   CAPTION: Table 5. Contents of customer_source

   id  first_name last_name age
   111 FN1        LN1       32
   222 FN2        LN2       40
   3   FN3        LN3       11
   Using the MERGE operator when maprdb.column.id is not the join key:
MERGE INTO client_mapr_db_json_target trg
USING client_source src
ON trg.age = src.age
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE
SET first_name = src.first_name,
last_name  = src.last_name
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES
(src.id, src.first_name, src.last_name, src.age);

   The result after merge into target is:

   CAPTION: Table 6. Result of MERGE operator

   id first_name last_name age
   1  FN1        LN1       32
   2  FN2        LN2       40
   3  FN3        FN3       11
   Here the join key is column is age. Two values of age (32 and 40) are
   the same in tables client_mapr_db_json_target and client_source. You
   want to update columns first_name and last_name if age is the same, and
   insert the row if age differs. You expect row (3, FN3, FN3, 11) to be
   inserted into client_mapr_db_json_target table, but the table already
   has a row with id 3:
(3, Lee, Harwin, 25)

   Since MapR Database JSON tables do not allow two rows with the same
   merge.maprdb.column.id, row (3, Lee, Harwin, 25) is replaced with (3,
   FN3, FN3, 11), even if the MERGE operator consists of WHEN NOT MATCHED
   THEN INSERT VALUES and you may expect it to be inserted.

Deleting while merging

   Deletions are not supported in a MERGE statement. This example:
MERGE INTO  customer_db_json old
USING customer_new new ON new.id = old.id
WHEN MATCHED AND old.age > 10 THEN DELETE;

   Will raise the following exception:
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException Deletes are no
t supported for MapR DB JSON tables (state=42000,code=40000)

Multiple source rows match a given target row (cardinality violation)

   Consider two tables customer_db_json and customer_new:

   CAPTION: Table 7. Contents of customer_db_json

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 John       Smith     45
   002 Michael    Watson    27
   003 Den        Brown     33

   And:

   CAPTION: Table 8. Contents of customer_new

   id  first_name last_name age
   001 Dorothi    Hogward   77
   001 Dorothi    Hogward   77
   088 Robert     Dowson    25
   To MERGE customer_new and customer_db_json:
MERGE INTO customer_db_json trg
USING customer_new src ON src.id = trg.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE
SET first_name = src.first_name,
last_name = src.last_name
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES
(src.id, src.first_name, src.last_name, src.age);

   This example causes an exception because of duplicate values in the id
   column in the customer_new table:
Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: Error evaluating ca
rdinality_violation(_col0)

   To avoid cardinality violation, set hive.merge.cardinality.check=false,
   but in this case the result is unpredictable because there is no rule
   which defines the order of duplicated data that will be inserted while
   using the MERGE statement.

Merge on mixed data types

   The MERGE operation also supports mixed data types, such as arrays,
   maps, and structures.

   Consider two tables mixed_types_source and mixed_types_target:

   CAPTION: Table 9. Contents of mixed_types_source

   doc_id                           user_info
   1      {"name":"Brandon","surname":"Lee","age":31,"gender":"MALE"}
   2      {"name":"Johnson","surname":"Fall","age":23,"gender":"MALE"}
   3      {"name":"Mary","surname":"Dowson","age":11,"gender":"FEMALE"}
   4      {"name":"Paul","surname":"Rodgers","age":41,"gender":"MALE"}

   And:

   CAPTION: Table 10. Contents of mixed_types_target

   id                           user_info
   1  {"name":"Lexx","surname":"Comfuzer","age":31,"gender":"MALE"}
   To MERGE mixed_types_source and mixed_types_target:
MERGE INTO mixed_types_target trg
USING mixed_types_source src
ON src.doc_id = old.doc_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE
SET user_info = src.user_info
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES
(src.doc_id, src.user_info);

   The result after merge into target is:

   CAPTION: Table 11. Result of MERGE operator

   id                          first_name
   1  {"name":"Brandon","surname":"Lee","age":31,"gender":"MALE"}
   2  {"name":"Johnson","surname":"Fall","age":23,"gender":"MALE"}
   3  {"name":"Mary","surname":"Dowson","age":11,"gender":"FEMALE"}
   4  {"name":"Paul","surname":"Rodgers","age":41,"gender":"MALE"}
   It is important to note that you cannot update only a part of a complex
   structure field. For example, you have a structure stored as one field
   in a Hive table:
{"name":"Johnson","surname":"Fall","age":23,"gender":"MALE"}

   You cannot update only the age field in the structure. You can only
   replace all values of the structure with new ones. See [9]Understanding
   the UPDATE Statement for details.

Merge into external MapR Database JSON tables

   The MERGE operator is also available for external MapR Database JSON
   tables. Use external tables as target tables for merge. No additional
   syntax is needed.

Merge into partitioned MapR Database JSON tables

   Partitioned MapR Database JSON tables are not supported.

Merge into temporary MapR Database JSON tables

   The MERGE operator is also available for temporary MapR Database JSON
   tables. Use temporary tables as target tables for merge. No additional
   syntax is needed.
