Hive UDFs

   To use Hive UDFs in Impala, get the applicable JAR files from the Hive
   UDFs, and use the Impala UDF deployment process to create new UDFs with
   new names.

   Data types of arguments must match the function signature exactly when
   reusing Hive Java code for built-in functions.

   To use a Hive UDF with Impala, complete the following steps:
    1. Get a copy of the Hive JAR file with the UDFs that you want to use
       with Impala.
    2. Issue the following command to see a list of classes inside the JAR
       file: jar -tf <jar_filename>
    3. Copy the JAR file to a MapR-FS location that Impala can read.
    4. From the impala-shell, create a database to use with the UDF.
    5. To identify the data base that you want to query using the UDF,
       issue the USE statement to through the impala-shell for that
       particular database, or specify the SQL function name as
       db_name.function_name.
    6. Issue a CREATE FUNCTION statement for each UDF that you want to use
       with Impala. The CREATE FUNCTION statement should contain a
       LOCATION clause with the full MapR-FS path to the JAR file and a
       SYMBOL clause with a fully qualified name of the class. Use dots as
       separators. Do not use the .classpath extension.
    7. Issue a query and call the function. Pass the correct type of
       arguments to the function.
