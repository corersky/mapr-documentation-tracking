Sentry

   Important: MapR officially supports Sentry with Impala, Hive, Sqoop2,
   and Hue only if you buy Impala support and configure Impala to use
   Sentry.

   Apache Sentry is an authorization module for Hadoop that provides the
   granular, role-based authorization required to provide precise levels
   of access to authenticated users and applications. Sentry allows users
   to see only those objects for which they have privileges.

Storage Models

   Sentry supports two models for storing policy rules:

   Database storage (preferred)
          As of Sentry 1.6-1602, you can configure Sentry to use the
          database storage mode. With this mode, the Sentry service
          provides access to read and maintain privileges and roles from a
          database.

   File-based storage
          Privileges and roles are accessed from and maintained in a
          policy file (global-policy.ini) which you can store on the
          MapR-FS. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of
          the file-based storage model:

Privileges

   Privileges are granted on different objects in the schema, including
   tables, databases, URIs and servers. The object hierarchy is set up
   like this, where objects inherit privileges from objects above them in
   the hierarchy:

   Privileges and roles are specified in either a relational database (for
   database rule storage) or a global-policy.ini file (for file-based rule
   storage). The following examples show a global-policy.ini file along
   with the equivalent set of privileges and roles expressed in HiveSQL
   syntax.

Sample global-policy.ini File

[groups]
        # Assigns each Hadoop group to its set of roles
        manager = analyst_role, junior_analyst_role
        analyst = analyst_role
        jranalyst = junior_analyst_role
        customers_admin = customers_admin_role
        admin = admin_role

        [roles]
        # The uris below define a landing pad which
        # the user can use to import or export data from the system.
        # Since the server runs as the user "hive," files in that directory
        # must either have read/write permissions set for the group hive
        # or have read/write permissions set for world.
        analyst_role = server=HS2->db=analyst1, \
        server=HS2->db=jranalyst1->table=*->action=select
        server=HS2->uri=maprfs:/landing/analyst1
        junior_analyst_role = server=HS2->db=jranalyst1, \
        server=HS2->uri=maprfs:/landing/jranalyst1

        # Implies everything on HS2.
        admin_role = server=HS2
