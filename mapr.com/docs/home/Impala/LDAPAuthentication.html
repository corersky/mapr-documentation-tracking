LDAP Authentication

   As of Impala 1.2.3, client connections with Impala can be authenticated
   against LDAP servers. You can configure LDAP authentication for client
   connections with Impala on a non-secure MapR cluster. When you
   configure LDAP authentication, you must configure SSL between the
   client and Impala, and between Impala and the LDAP server to avoid
   sending credentials over the wire in clear text. Configuration
   requirements apply to the server side when configuring and starting
   Impala.

   If the Hive metastore has MapR-SASL enabled, copy
   $HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml to $IMPALA_HOME/conf/. Repeat this step
   any time the hive-site.xml file is modified.

   Modify /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh and include the
   following options to configure Impala server LDAP authentication:

   CAPTION:

   Options Description
   --enable_ldap_auth Set this option to "true" in all environments to
   enable LDAP authentication between Impala and the client.
   --ldap_uri Sets the URI of the LDAP server to use. Typically, the URI
   is prefixed with ldap://<hostname>. Optionally, the URI can specify the
   port. For example, ldap://<hostname>:<port>.
   --ldap_manual_config extend col Bypasses all of the automatic
   configuration if you need to provide a custom SASL.
   --ldap_tls Tells Impala to start a TLS connection to the LDAP server
   and to fail authentication if Impala cannot start the TLS connection.
   Example:
IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS=" \
    -log_dir=${IMPALA_LOG_DIR} \
    -state_store_port=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_PORT} \
    -enable_ldap_auth=true \
    -ldap_uri=ldap://10.250.1.5/ \
    -ldap_tls=true \
    -use_statestore \
    -state_store_host=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST} \
    -catalog_service_host=${CATALOG_SERVICE_HOST} \
    -be_port=${IMPALA_BACKEND_PORT}"

   After you restart the Impala server, statestore, and catalog, you can
   connect to Impala using LDAP authentication. To connect to Impala,
   launch the impala-shell from a client node and issue the following
   commands:

   CAPTION:

   Command Description
   -l Enables LDAP authentication.
   -u Sets the user. The impala-shell prompts you for the password. Per
   Active Directory, the user is the short username, not the full LDAP
   distinguished name.
   --ldap_password_cmd (Impala 2.5.0 only) Sets the bash command to
   retrieve the LDAP user password.
   Example:
impala-shell -l -u uid=qa-user1,ou=People,dc=maprtech,dc=com --ldap_password_cmd
="echo -n
      secret"
