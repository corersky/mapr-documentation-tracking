Integrate Hue with Sentry

   You can integrate Hue with Sentry 1.6 on a secure cluster that uses
   kerberos authentication but the intergration is not supported on a
   secure cluster that uses MapR-SASL authentication. Integrate Hue with
   Sentry when you want to use the Hue Security application to manage
   Sentry roles and privileges. When you integrate Hue with Sentry, Sentry
   must use the database storage model.
   Note: The Hue user that manages Sentry roles and privileges in Hue must
   belong to a Hue group that is also part of the Sentry admin group.
    1. In the [libsentry] section of the hue.ini
       (/opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/desktop/conf/hue.ini), configure the
       following properties:
[libsentry]
                        # Hostname or IP of server.
                        hostname=localhost

                        # Port the sentry service is running on.
                        port=8038

                        # Sentry configuration directory, where sentry-site.xml
is located.
                        sentry_conf_dir=/opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<version>/conf/s
entry-site.xml
    2. If Sentry uses Kerberos authentication, edit the following property
       in sentry-site.xml
       (/opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-<version>/conf/sentry-site.xml) to enable
       the Hue admin user (mapr) to connect to Sentry:
<property>
                        <name>sentry.service.allow.connect</name>
                        <value>impala,hive,mapr</value>
                        </property>
    3. Restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <ip_address>
