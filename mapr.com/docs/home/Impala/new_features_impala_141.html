New Features in Impala 1.4.1 for MapR

Admission Control

   A new feature that enforces limits on concurrent SQL queries and
   statements that run in an Impala cluster with heavy workloads. When
   admission control is enabled, Impala queues SQL queries and statements
   that it would otherwise cancel or re-run due to insufficient resources
   or performance bottlenecks.

   You can configure admission control options that Impala uses to enforce
   limits on the following behaviors:
     * Number of concurrent queries that run in the cluster
     * Query queue size
     * Number of delayed queries that the queue can hold
     * Amount of memory that queries use
     * Time that queries can exist in queue before Impala cancels them

   Refer to [1]Admission Control for more information.

Partition Pruning

   Partition pruning now includes performance improvements that reduce the
   time spent on query planning for partitioned tables with thousands of
   partitions. Previously, Impala could query tables with up to
   approximately 3000 partitions. Now, Impala can comfortably query tables
   with tens of thousands of partitions.

Impala Daemon Options

   The following table lists new Impala daemon start up options that you
   can add to the env.sh configuration file:
   Option Default Description
   load_catalog_in_background true New start up option to control the
   parallelism of metadata loading during start up for the catalogd
   daemon. Makes Impala use background threads after start up to load and
   cache metadata.
   num_metadata_loading_threads 16 New start up option for controlling the
   parallelism of metadata loading during start up for the catalogd
   daemon. Determines how much parallelism Impala devotes to loading
   metadata in the background. You can increase this value for systems
   with a huge number of databases, tables, or partitions. You can lower
   this value for busy systems that have CPU-constraints due to jobs from
   other components running in the cluster.
   insert_inherit_permissions

   Same permissions as parent

   directory

   New start up option that causes Impala INSERT statements to create each
   new partition with the same MapR-FS permissions as its parent
   directory. By default, INSERT

   statements create directories for new partitions using default MapR-FS
   permissions.

Impala-Shell Command Line Options

   The following table lists the new option with its description:
   Option Description
   strict_unicode The impala-shell interpreter now supports UTF-8
   characters for input and output. You can control whetherimpala-shell
   ignores invalid Unicode code points through this option.

Security

   The following table contains new security features and their
   descriptions:
   Feature Description
   LDAP LDAP connections can be secured through either SSL or TLS.
   Sentry-based authorization Impala can now use Sentry-based
   authorization based onthe original policy file.

Functions

   The following table lists new functions and their descriptions:
   Statement Description

   NULLIF()

   NULLIFZERO()

   ZEROIFNULL()
   New conditional functions that simplify porting SQL containing vendor
   extensions to Impala.
   CURRENT DATABASE() New utility function that returns the database that
   the session is currently using.

Built-In Functions

   The following table lists new built-in functions and their
   descriptions:
   Function Description
   ADD_MONTHS() A built-in function that is an alias for the existing
   MONTHS_ADD() function.
   EXTRACT() A new built-in function that returns one date or time field
   from a TIMESTAMP value.
   ROUND() A new built-in function that rounds DECIMAL values to a
   specified number of fractional digits.
   TRUNC() A new built-in function that truncates date/time values to a
   particular granularity, such as year, month, day, hour, and so on.

   STDDEV(),

   STDDEV_SAMP(),

   STDDEV_POP(),

   VARIANCE(),

   VARIANCE_SAMP(),

   VARIANCE_POP()
   Built-in aggregate functions for computing properties for statistical
   distributions.

   MAX_INT(),

   MIN_SMALLINT()

   New built-in functions that you can use to check whether data values
   are in an expected range.

   You might be able to switch a column to a smaller type to save memory
   during processing.

   IS_INF(),

   IS_NAN()

   New built-in functions that check for special values infinity and “not
   a number”. These values could be specified as inf or nan in text data
   files.

   They may also be produced by certain arithmetic expressions.

Statements

   The following table lists new or improved statements and their
   descriptions:
   Statement Description
   COMPUTE STATS

   Use this statement to collect table and column statistics with a single
   statement.

   Useful for query planning, join queries, queries on partitioned tables,
   and any other data intensive operations.

   This release includes the following performance improvements for the
   statement:
     * The
NDV
       function is sped up through native code generation.
     * Because the NULL count is not currently used by the Impala query
       planner, in Impala 1.4.0 and higher,
COMPUTE STATS
       does not count the NULL values for each column. The #Nulls field of
       the stats table is
       left as -1, signifying that the value is unknown.

   CREATE TABLE

   SQL syntax for creating a table.

   This release includes the following improvements for the statement:
     * You can now specify the clause FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\0' to use
       text data files that use ASCII 0 (nul) characters as a delimiter.
     * For interoperability with Parquet files created through other
       Hadoop components, such as Pig or MapReduce applications, you can
       create
       an Impala table that automatically sets up the column definitions
       based on the layout of an existing Parquet data file.
     * Has a STORED AS AVRO clause, enabling you to create Avro tables
       through Impala.

   EXPLAIN PLAN

   When you run EXPLAIN PLAN followed by a SELECT query, it returns the
   query execution plan. EXPLAIN PLAN now provides more detail in a
   simpler format with the following verbosity levels:
     * 0 – Most concise
     * 1
     * 2
     * 3 – Most verbose

   INVALIDATE METADATA table_name Impala loads metadata for a Hive table
   when you issue the INVALIDATE METADATA table_name statement if a Hive
   table exists with the same name.
   SHOW FUNCTIONS

   Shows user-defined functions associated with a particular database.

   This release includes the following improvements for the statement:
     * Now displays the return type and argument type of each function.
     * You can now specify the clause FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\0' with a
       CREATE TABLE
       statement to use text data files that use ASCII 0 (nul) characters
       as a delimiter.

   SHOW PARTITIONS

   Displays information about each partition in a partitioned table. Run
   the COMPUTE STATS statement after creating all table partitions and
   then run

   SHOW PARTITIONS for more informative output.

Data Types

   The following table lists new or improved data types with their
   descriptions:
   Data Type Description
   DECIMAL A numeric data type that you can use in CREATE TABLE and ALTER
   TABLE statements to store fixed-precision values when working with
   currency or other fractional values where it is important to represent
   values exactly and avoid rounding errors. Useful for calculations where
   the imprecise representation and rounding behavior of FLOAT and DOUBLE
   make them impractical to use. Includes enhancements to built-in
   functions, numeric literals, and arithmetic expressions.
   TIMESTAMP Accepts more input string formats through the UNIX TIMESTAMP
   function, and produces more string formats through the FROM UNIXTIME
   function.

Clauses and Operators

   The following table lists new or improved clauses and operators with
   descriptions:
   Feature Description
   ORDER BY No longer requires a LIMIT clause. If the size of the result
   set to be sorted exceeds the memory available to Impala,Impala uses a
   temporary work space on disk to perform the sort operation.

   REGEXP

   RLIKE

   Improved compatibility with the regular expression support for popular
   database systems. There is no change to the behavior of the
   regexp_extract() and regexp_replace() built-in functions.

   These operators now match a regular expression string that occurs
   anywhere inside the target string; the same as if the regular
   expression was enclosed on each side by .*.
