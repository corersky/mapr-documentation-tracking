   download the driver to access Impala from a Java application or any
   tool that uses a JDBC connection. The documentation for the Impala JDBC
   1.0.46 driver is available at [1]Impala JDBC Driver.

   The MapR Impala ODBC Driver is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux,
   and Mac OS X. The driver complies with the ODBC 3.52 data standard and
   adds Unicode and 32- and 64-bit support on all platforms. The ODBC
   driver connects to an Impala server regardless of the serverâ€™s host
   operating system. The documentation for the Impala ODBC 1.2.16 driver
   is available at [2]Impala ODBC Driver.
