New Features in Impala 2.7.0 for MapR

   Impala 2.7.0 for MapR introduces some new features that enhance the
   behavior and performance of Impala.

Performance Improvements

   Impala 2.7.0 for MapR introduces the following performance
   improvements:
     * Overall performance improvements for secure clusters.
     * Overall performance improvements for join queries. A pre-fetching
       mechanism is used while building the in-memory hash table to
       evaluate join predicates.
     * Improved query time for queries run against DECIMAL columns in Avro
       tables. The code that parses DECIMAL values from Avro now uses
       native code generation.
     * Improved efficiency in LLVM code generation that can reduce codegen
       time, especially for short queries.
     * Improved performance reading Parquet files.
     * Improved performance for top-N queries, or queries that include
       both ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses.

Support for the Amazon S3 File System

   You can use Impala to query data in the Amazon S3 file system. Impala
   can query any file type supported by the S3 file system.
   To run Impala on the Amazon S3 file system, add the properties below to
   the core-site.xml file, copy the core-site.xml file to the
   IMPALA_CONF_DIR (located in /opt/mapr/impala/impala-2.7.0/conf), and
   restart the MapR Warden service.
<property>
<name>fs.s3a.access.key</name>
<value><ACCESS_KEY></value>
</property>

<property>
<name>fs.s3a.secret.key</name>
<value><SECRET_KEY></value>
</property>

   Note:
   If you plan to run Impala on a secure cluster, create and add the root
   Certificate Authority (CA) certificate that signed the Amazon S3
   certificate to the truststore. Alternatively, you can add the following
   property to core-site.xml:
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
</property>

Impala Web User Interface Improvements

   In version 2.7.0, Impala provides the following Web User Interface
   improvements:
     * Forced session expiry from the /sessions tab. You can force a
       session to end by clicking on the link provided in the tab.
     * Additional Impala memory information on the /memz tab.
     * A Memory tab on the Details page for a query.

Set Column Stats Clause

   In version 2.7.0, you can use the SET COLUMN STATS clause with the
   ATLER TABLE statement to set a specific statistical value for a column.
   You can set a column to the number of distinct values, number of nulls,
   maximum size, or average size using the respective case-insensitive
   symbolic names:
   numDVs, numNulls, avgSize, maxSize
   Note: This operation applies to an entire table, not a specific
   partition. You must use single quotation marks around the symbolic name
   and value.
   Run the ALTER TABLE command with the SET COLUMN STATS clause from the
   impala-shell, as shown in the following example:
$ impala-shell -i localhost
...
[localhost:21000] > create table example (id int);
[localhost:21000] > insert into example values (1), (2), (3);
[localhost:21000] > show column stats example;
+--------+--------+------------------+--------+----------+----------+
| Column | Type   | #Distinct Values | #Nulls | Max Size | Avg Size |
+--------+--------+------------------+--------+----------+----------+
| id      | INT   | -1               | -1     | 4        | 4        |
+--------+--------+------------------+--------+----------+----------+
[localhost:21000] > alter table example set column stats id ('numDvs'='3','numNu
lls'='0');
[localhost:21000] > show column stats example;
+--------+--------+------------------+--------+----------+----------+
| Column | Type   | #Distinct Values | #Nulls | Max Size | Avg Size |
+--------+--------+------------------+--------+----------+----------+
| id     | INT    | 3                | 0      | 4        | 4        |
+--------+--------+------------------+--------+----------+----------+

SOURCE Command

   The SOURCE command runs SQL statements from an SQL source file. You
   issue the SOURCE command from the impala-shell. The source file can
   contain SQL statements and impala-shell commands, as well as additional
   SOURCE commands. Each statement or command must end with a semicolon
   (;), except for the last statement or command in the file.

   Including additional SOURCE commands inside the source file allows you
   to set up flexible statement sequences for use cases, such as schema
   setup, ETL, or reporting.

   Run the SOURCE command from the impala-shell, as shown in the following
   example:
$ cat example.sql
show databases;
show tables in customers;
$ impala-shell -i localhost
...
[localhost:21000] > source example.sql;
Query: show databases
+------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| name             | comment                                      |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| customers        | Stores customer records                      |
| default          | Default Hive database                        |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------+
Fetched 2 row(s) in 0.06s
Query: show tables in customers
+--------------+
| name         |
+--------------+
| customer_001 |
| customer_002 |
| customer_003 |
| customer_004 |
| customer_005 |
+--------------+
Fetched 5 row(s) in 0.03s

   Additionally, you can run the SOURCE command on an SQL file that
   contains statements and calls a SOURCE command from another SLQ file,
   as shown in the following example:
$ cat example1.sql
show databases;
source example2.sql
$ cat example2.sql
show tables in customers;

$ impala-shell -i localhost
...
[localhost:21000] > source example1.sql;
Query: show databases
+------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| name             | comment                                      |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| customers        | Stores customer records                      |
| default          | Default Hive database                        |
+------------------+----------------------------------------------+
Fetched 2 row(s) in 0.06s
Query: show tables in customers
+--------------+
| name         |
+--------------+
| customer_001 |
| customer_002 |
| customer_003 |
| customer_004 |
| customer_005 |
+--------------+
Fetched 5 row(s) in 0.03s

New Runtime Filter Options

   The Runtime Filtering feature was introduced in [1]Impala 2.5.0 to
   optimize queries against partitioned tables or to evaluate join
   conditions when partial table data is needed. Impala 2.7.0 introduces
   two new filtering options that fine-tune the sizes of the Bloom filter
   structures used in runtime filtering:
   The following table lists the new query options and their descriptions.
   Only modify these options when tuning long-running queries with a
   combination of large partitioned tables and joins on large tables.

   CAPTION:

   Option Description Type Default
   RUNTIME_FILTER_MIN_SIZE Adjusts runtime filtering settings. Defines the
   minimum size for a filter, regardless of the estimates produced by the
   planner. This setting overrides any smaller value set for the
   RUNTIME_BLOOM_FILTER_SIZE option. Impala rounds filter sizes up to the
   nearest power of two. integer

   0 (indicates that the value from the corresponding impalad startup
   option is used)

   RUNTIME_FILTER_MAX_SIZE Adjusts runtime filtering settings. Defines the
   maximum size for a filter, regardless of the estimates produced by the
   planner. This setting overrides any smaller value set for the
   RUNTIME_BLOOM_FILTER_SIZE option. Impala rounds filter sizes up to the
   nearest power of two. integer

   0 (indicates that the value from the corresponding impalad startup
   option is used)
