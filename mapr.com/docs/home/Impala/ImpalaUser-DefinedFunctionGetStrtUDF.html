Get Started with UDFs

   Before you can write UDFs for your Impala queries, you must install the
   Impala development package that contains header and build configuration
   files, and download the sample source code.

   The development package provides a header file that is required to
   develop UDFs and UDAFs. The header contains the types that must be used
   and the FunctionContext object. This object is the interface object
   between the UDF or UDAF and the Impala process. You can access the
   header in /usr/include/impala_udf/udf.h

   The sample source code provides sample files that you can view to see
   the declarations required to write UDFs and UDAFs, and sample source
   code used to create a simple UDF and UDAF example.

   After you have installed the development package and sample source
   code, you can build the samples to create an environment that you can
   use to write your UDFs and UDAFs. Once you have completed your UDF or
   UDAF, you can deploy it.

   Complete the following steps to create UDFs and UDAFs for use with
   Impala:
