Managing Impala

   To manage Impala, you can start and stop the Impala services, modify
   resource allocation, and use log files to identify and resolve issues.

Starting/Stopping Impala

   From the MCS

   You must start the statestore service before you start the catalog or
   the Impala service.

   To start the Impala statestore and catalog services from the MCS,
   complete the following steps:
    1. In the Navigation pane, expand the Cluster Views pane and click
       Dashboard.
    2. In the Services pane, click Impala statestore. The Nodes screen
       appears and displays the node configured with the statestore
       service.
    3. Click the hostname of the node with the statestore and catalog
       services configured to display the Node Properties screen.
    4. Use the Stop/Start button in the Impala statestore row under Manage
       Services to start Impala statestore.
    5. Use the Stop/Start button in the Impala catalog row under Manage
       Services to start Impala catalog.

   To start Impala server from the MCS, complete the following steps:
    1. In the Navigation pane, expand the Cluster Views pane and click
       Dashboard.
    2. In the Services pane, click Impala server. The Nodes screen appears
       and displays the nodes configured with the Impala server.
    3. Click the hostname of the a node with the Impala server configured
       to display its Node Properties screen.
    4. Use the Stop/Start button in the Impala server row under Manage
       Services to start the Impala server.
    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the remaining nodes configured with the
       Impala server.

   From the CLI

   You must start the statestore service before you start the catalog or
   the Impala service.

   To start Impala from the command line, complete the following steps:
    1. Issue the following command to start the statestore service on the
       node with statestored:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalastore -action start|stop -nodes <node I
P addresses separated by a space>
Example:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalastore -action start -nodes 10.10.30.166
    2. Issue the following command to start the catalog service on the
       node with catalogd:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalacatalog -action start|stop -nodes <node
 IP addresses separated by a space>
Example:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalacatalog -action start -nodes 10.10.30.1
66
    3. Issue the following command to start the Impala service on the
       node(s) with impalad:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalaserver -action start|stop -nodes < node
 IP addresses separated by a space >
Example:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalaserver -action start -nodes 10.10.30.16
6
    4. Optionally, you can run the following command to launch the
       impala-shell if you want to issue queries from the command line:
${IMPALA_HOME}/bin/impala-shell.sh

Modify Resource Allocation

   If you run Impala on nodes that also run MapReduce, both frameworks may
   suffer poor performance if they have to compete for resources. You can
   configure memory based on your job requirements and SLAs to ensure that
   each framework has enough resources to avoid conflicts. For information
   about modifying memory, refer to [1]Additional Impala Configuration
   Options.

Impala Logs

   Impala logs provide information errors, configuration, and completed
   jobs. You can review log files on each node. An Impala administrator
   should review the log files and set log levels.

   Impala uses the glog_v logging system to store information. Some
   messages refer to C++ file names. The GLOG_v environment variable
   specifies which types of messages Impala logs.

   Reviewing Logs

   You can locate log files in the Impala installation directory
   (/opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/logs) on each node with Impala.
   Impala creates a new set of log files on each statestored or impalad
   restart.

   The following table provides a list of the important log files for the
   impalad and statestored processes with descriptions:

   CAPTION:

   Log Type Impalad Filename Statestored Filename File Content
   INFO impalad.INFO statestored.INFO Shows configuration settings for the
   processes.
   WARNING impalad.WARNING statestored.WARNING Shows problem information,
   including such things as suboptimal settings and also serious runtime
   errors.
   ERROR impalad.ERROR statestored.ERROR Shows the most serious errors,
   such as process crashes, failed queries. The .WARNING file also shows
   these messages.

   Setting Log Levels

   The GLOG system has three logging levels that you can adjust by
   exporting variable settings. The logging levels are cumulative.
   Increasing logging levels may decrease performance and increases log
   size. Change logging settings before you start impalad.

   The following table provides the logging levels and their descriptions:

   CAPTION:

   Level Description
   GLOG_v=1 Default. Logs information about each connection and query that
   is initiated to an impalad instance, including runtime profiles
   GLOG_v=2 Logs everything from GLOG_v=1 plus information for each RPC
   initiated. This level also records query execution progress
   information, including details on each file read.
   GLOG_v=3 Logs everything from GLOG_v=2 plus it logs row read. This
   level is only applicable for the most serious troubleshooting and
   tuning scenarios, because it can produce exceptionally large and
   detailed large log files.

   Use the following command to change logging settings:
export GLOG_v=1

   For more information on how to configure GLOG, including how to set
   variable logging levels for different system components, see [2]Fixed
   in 5.2 r1.0.

   Log Rotation
   Log rotation is the automatic removal of unneeded or old log files. By
   default, Impala switches out old log files every 5 seconds, based on
   the default interval specified in the logbufsecs setting. The
   -max_log_files configuration option specifies how many log files to
   keep at each severity level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL). You can
   configure the -max_log_files option for each Impala daemon (impalad,
   statestored, and catalogd) in the env.sh configuration file. By
   default, Impala preserves the latest 10 log files for each severity
   level and removes old logs based on the logbufsecs setting. Setting
   -max_log_files to 0 preserves all of the log files. This setting
   requires manual log rotation. Setting max_log_files to 1 preserves only
   the latest log file.
