Deploying UDFs and UDAFs

   To deploy your UDFs or UDAFs, complete the following steps from the
   impala-shell:
    1. Issue a USE statement to the database that you want to associate
       your new function with.
    2. Issue a CREATE FUNCTION statement in the impala-shell to make
       Impala aware of the new function.
          + To deploy a UDF, issue the CREATE FUNCTION statement.
          + To deploy a UDAF, issue the CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION
            statement. Specify the entry points of the underlying C++
            functions using the clauses INIT_FN, UPDATE_FN, and
            FINALIZE_FN.
       Warning: You can also issue the CREATE FUNCTION with a fully
       qualified database name to skip the USE statement step. Example:
       CREATE FUNCTION <db_name.function_name>
