Spill to Disk

   Impala 2.2.0 for MapR introduces the "spill to disk" feature which
   prevents queries that use memory-intensive operations, such as large
   sort, join, aggregation, or analytic function operations, from failing
   with out-of-memory errors. Impala automatically writes data to disk
   when queries with memory-intensive operations exceed the set memory
   limit on an Impala node. You can enable or disable the spill to disk
   feature in /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh. You can also
   change the DISABLE_UNSAFE_SPILLS setting at the session level to allow
   or prevent data spills.

   Impala reserves a certain amount of memory for memory-intensive
   operations that reach the set memory threshold. This memory reserve
   serves as a buffer that slows an operation's use of memory and in some
   instances prevents operations from exceeding the memory limit on a
   node. If the amount of memory used exceeds the set memory limit, Impala
   starts writing data to disk (spilling to disk).

   Impala writes data to a temporary work area on disk. The default
   location of this work area is /tmp/impala-scratch. You can start the
   impalad daemon with the --scratch_dirs="path_to_directory"
   configuration option to change the directory location, however the
   scratch directory must reside on the local file system. You can specify
   a single directory, or a comma-separated list of directories. If there
   is less than 1 GB of available space on the filesystem where the
   scratch directory resides, Impala writes a warning message to its log
   when it runs. When an operation completes, the data is removed from the
   disk.

Prevent Data from Spilling to Disk

   Spilling to disk can have significant performance implications due to
   the additional I/O required. Ideally, you want to optimize queries,
   system parameters, and the hardware configurations to prevent data from
   spilling to disk. The following points describe some techniques that
   can prevent data from spilling to disk:
     * View the query profile after you run queries to determine how often
       they spill to disk and how much temporary data is written to disk.
       You can run the PROFILE command from the impala-shell or you can
       view the Impala debug web user interface to see the profile for the
       query.
     * Increase the number of Impala nodes in the cluster to increase the
       aggregate memory available.
     * Increase the overall memory capacity of each node at the hardware
       level.
     * On a multi-tenant cluster, use resource management features to
       allocate more memory for Impala.
     * If you are running concurrent queries rather than a few
       memory-intensive ones, use the admission control feature to lower
       the limit on the number of concurrent queries. You can schedule the
       most resource-intensive queries to avoid spikes in memory usage and
       improve overall response times. See [1]Admission Control.
     * Use the following techniques to tune the queries with the highest
       memory requirements:
          + Run the COMPUTE STATS statement for all tables involved in
            large-scale joins and aggregation queries.
          + Minimize the use of STRING columns in join columns. Use
            numeric values instead.
          + Evaluate the EXPLAIN plan to see the execution plan used for
            the most resource-intensive queries.
          + Add hints to the most resource-intensive queries to select the
            right execution strategy.
          + If your queries experience substantial performance overhead
            due to spilling, enable the DISABLE_UNSAFE_SPILLS query option
            to prevent queries from spilling to disk.

DISABLE_UNSAFE_SPILLS

   You can categorize queries that spill to disk as safe or unsafe. A
   spill that results from optimized queries may represent a safe spill,
   whereas a spill that results from running large ad-hoc queries with
   unknown performance implications may represent an unsafe spill. For
   example, if a query does not include a hint to set the most efficient
   mechanism for a join or an INSERT ... SELECT into a partitioned table,
   these tables will most likely result in suboptimal execution plans that
   could cause unnecessary spilling.

   When DISABLE_UNSAFE_SPILLS is enabled (set to "true"), you can run the
   COMPUTE STATS statement on large tables involved in join queries and
   resource-intensive operations. The COMPUTE STATS statement collects
   table and column statistics to help estimate memory usage for each
   query before you allow data to spill to disk.
   If you have determined that your queries will spill safely to disk, run
   the following command to turn the DISABLE_UNSAFE_SPILLS option off:
set DISABLE_UNSAFE_SPILLS=false

Disable the Spill to Disk Feature

   You can disable the spill to disk feature if spilling to disk
   negatively affects performance or you do not know the performance
   implications or memory usage of queries in advance.

   To disable the spill to disk feature, complete the following steps:
    1. On each node running the Impala server, edit
       /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh , and set the
       following options to “false”:
-enable_partitioned_aggregation=false
-enable_partitioned_hash_join=false
    2. Save the env.sh file and then run the following commands to restart
       the Impala service and instances:
         a. Run the following command to restart the Impala server:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalaserver -action restart -nodes <IP addre
ss where impala server is installed>
         b. Run the following command to restart the Impala statestore:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalastore -action restart -nodes <IP addres
s where impala statestore is installed>
         c. Run the following command to restart the Impala catalog:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalacatalog -action restart -nodes <IP addr
ess where impala catalog is installed>
