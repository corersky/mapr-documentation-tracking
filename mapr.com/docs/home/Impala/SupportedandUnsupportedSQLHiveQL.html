Supported and Unsupported SQL/HiveQL Language Features

   Supported HiveQL Statements and Clauses
     * JOIN
     * AGGREGATE
     * DISTINCT
     * UNION ALL
     * ORDER BY (Must use a LIMIT clause with ORDER BY.)
     * LIMIT (Accepts arithmetic expressions and numeric literals. You can
       include the OFFSET clause with the LIMIT clause to produce paged
       result sets, like 11-20.)
     * FROM (You can include FROM in an uncorrelated subquery.)
     * INSERT INTO
     * INSERT OVERWRITE
     * LEFT|RIGHT ANTI JOIN

   Supported SQL Statements

   When you issue an SQL statement, use a semicolon at the end of each
   statement.
     * COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS
     * COMPUTE STATS
     * CREATE ROLE
     * CREATE TABLE
          + Use the STORED AS PARQUET or STORED AS TEXTFILE clause with
            CREATE TABLE to identify the format of the underlying data
            files.
          + Use the TBLPROPERTIES clause with CREATE TABLE to associate
            random metadata with a table as key-value pairs.
          + Use SERDEPROPERTIES with CREATE TABLE to set up metadata that
            defines how tables are read and written. This may be required
            for Hive compatibility.
          + USE WITH SERDEPROPERTIES with CREATE TABLE to specify the
            SerDe classes that read and write data for a table. This may
            be required for Hive compatibility.
     * CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
     * CREATE VIEW
     * CURRENT DATABASE(Returns the database that the session is currently
       using.)
     * DESCRIBE
     * DROP INCREMENTAL STATS
     * DROP ROLE
     * EXPLAIN (You can issue the command SET EXPLAIN_LEVEL=verbose for
       more detailed EXPLAIN output. To revert, issue the command SET
       EXPLAIN_LEVEL=normal.)
     * EXPLAIN PLAN
     * GRANT
     * INVALIDATE METADATA
     * LOAD DATA
     * REFRESH
     * REVOKE
     * SELECT
          + You can use the STRAIGHT_JOIN keyword immediately after SELECT
            to override the reordering of join clauses that Impala does
            internally.
     * SHOW CREATE TABLE
     * SHOW DATABASES
     * SHOW FILES
     * SHOW FUNCTIONS
     * SHOW GRANT ROLE
     * SHOW ROLE GRANT GROUP
     * SHOW ROLES
     * SHOW SCHEMAS
     * SHOW TABLES
     * SHOW COLUMN STATS
     * SHOW TABLE STATS
     * USE

   Supported DDL Statements

   DDL statements typically change the table schema. Issue an INVALIDATE
   METADATA statement manually on the other nodes to update metadata. You
   can use the SET command to enable the SYNC_DDL option with any DDL
   statements to return after the Impala catalog service has propagated
   changes on all Impala nodes.
     * ALTER TABLE
          + Use the TBLPROPERTIES clause with ALTER TABLE to associate
            random metadata with a table as key-value pairs.
          + Use SERDEPROPERTIES with ALTER TABLE to set up metadata that
            defines how tables are read and written. This may be required
            for Hive compatibility.
     * ALTER VIEW
     * COMPUTE STATS
     * CREATE DATABASE
     * CREATE FUNCTION
     * CREATE ROLE
     * CREATE TABLE
     * CREATE VIEW
     * DROP DATABASE
     * DROP FUNCTION
     * DROP ROLE
     * DROP TABLE
     * DROP VIEW
     * GRANT
     * REVOKE

   Supported DML Statements

   Impala only supports the INSERT and LOAD DATA statements which modify
   data stored in tables.
     * Issue the REFRESH statement on other nodes to refresh the data
       location cache.
     * If the SYNC_DDL statement is enabled, INSERT statements complete
       after the catalog service propagates data and metadata changes to
       all Impala nodes.
     * You can use the [SHUFFLE] and [NOSHUFFLE] hints with INSERT to
       redistribute work during INSERT...SELECT operations. You may want
       to use these hints when inserting into partitioned Parquet tables
       to avoid memory consumption problems and simultaneous open files,
       by collecting new data for each partition on a specific node.

   Supported Datatypes

   Impala supports datatypes with the same names and semantics equivalent
   to those in Hive.
     * char
     * varchar
     * complex
     * string
     * tinyint
     * smallint
     * int
     * bigint
     * float
     * double
     * boolean
     * string
     * timestamp
     * asSTRING

   Supported Operators

   SQL operators are a class of comparison functions used within the WHERE
   clauses of a SELECT statement.
     * BETWEEN
     * COMPARISON
     * CROSS JOIN (Use as the join operator for Cartesian joins; does not
       use any ON clause.)
     * IN
     * IS NULL
     * LIKE
     * [NOT] EXISTS
     * [NOT] IN
     * REGEXP
     * RLIKE

   Supported Literals

   Each of the Impala data types has corresponding notation for literal
   values of that type. Specify literal values in SQL statements, such as
   in the SELECT list or WHERE clause of a query, or as an argument to a
   function call.
     * Numeric
     * String
     * Boolean
     * Timestamp
     * NULL (You can add the NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST clause at the end
       of the ORDER BY clause to override or specify the sorting behavior
       for NULL.)

   Supported Schema Objects and Object Names
     * Aliases
     * Identifiers
     * Databases
     * Tables
     * Views
     * Functions

   Analytic Functions

   Analytic (window) functions operate on a set of rows and return a
   single value for each row from the underlying query. The term "window"
   describes the set of rows on which the function operates. A window
   function uses values from the rows in a window to calculate the
   returned values. When you use a window function in a query, you define
   the window using the OVER() clause. The OVER() clause (window clause)
   differentiates window functions from other analytical and reporting
   functions.

   As of Impala 2.2.0, you can use the following analytic functions in
   queries:
     * MAX()
     * MIN()
     * COUNT()
     * AVG()
     * RANK()
     * LAG()
     * LEAD()
     * FIRST_VALUE()
     * MAX(), SUM()
     * COUNT()

   The analytic functions support the following syntax:

   CAPTION:

function(args) OVER([partition_by_clause] [order_by_clause [window_clause]]) par
tition_by_clause ::= PARTITION BY expr [, expr ...]
order_by_clause ::= ORDER BY expr  [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST] [, ex
pr [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST] ...]

   The window clause supports the following syntax:

   CAPTION:

ROWS BETWEEN [ { m | UNBOUNDED } PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW] [ AND [CURRENT ROW | {
 UNBOUNDED | n } FOLLOWING] ]
RANGE BETWEEN [ {m | UNBOUNDED } PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW] [ AND [CURRENT ROW | {
 UNBOUNDED | n } FOLLOWING] ]

   Supported Aggregate Functions

   Aggregate functions calculate a return value across all the items in a
   result set. When you issues a function, you must include a FROM clause
   in the query. Aggregate functions ignore NULL values rather than
   returning a NULL result.
     * APPX_MEDIAN()
     * AVG()
     * COUNT()
     * GROUP_CONCAT()
     * MAX()
     * MIN()
     * NDV()
     * SUM()

   Built-in Functions

   Impala supports lots of built-in functions that you can use directly
   with a SELECT statement to perform data transformation operations, such
   as mathematical calculations, string manipulations, and data
   calculations.

   Unsupported SQL Features
     * Non-scalar data types, such as maps, arrays, structs
     * LOAD DATA to load raw files
     * Restricted set of literal formats for the TIMESTAMP data type and
       the from_unixtime() format string
     * Extensibility mechanisms such as TRANSFORM, custom file formats, or
       custom SerDes
     * XML and JSON functions
     * The following HiveQL aggregate functions: variance, var_pop,
       var_samp, stddev_pop, stddev_samp, covar_pop, covar_samp, corr,
       percentile, percentile_approx,histogram_numeric, collect_set
     * User Defined Table Generating Functions (UDTFs)
     * User Defined Aggregate Functions (UDAFs)
     * User Defined Funtions
     * Sampling
     * Lateral views
     * Authorization features such as roles
     * Multiple DISTINCT clauses per query

   Unsupported HiveQL Statements
     * ANALYZE TABLE (the Impala equivalent is COMPUTE STATS)
     * DESCRIBE COLUMN
     * DESCRIBE DATABASE
     * EXPORT TABLE
     * IMPORT TABLE
     * SHOW PARTITIONS
     * SHOW TABLE EXTENDED
     * SHOW TBLPROPERTIES
     * SHOW FUNCTIONS
     * SHOW COLUMNS
     * SHOW CREATE TABLE
     * SHOW INDEXES

   Semantic Differences in Impala Statements vs HiveQL
     * Different syntax and names for query hints.
     * MapReduce specific features of SORT BY, DISTRIBUTE BY, or CLUSTER
       BY are not exposed.
     * Queries do not need a FROM clause.
     * Impala does not allow:
          + Implicit cast between string and numeric or Boolean types
          + Implicit casts among the numeric types or from string to
            timestamp
          + Storing timestamps using the local timezone; Timestamps are
            stored relative to GMT
          + Return column overflows as NULL; Impala returns the largest or
            smallest value in the range for the type
          + Virtual columns
     * Impala does not:
          + Expose locking
          + Expose some configuration properties
