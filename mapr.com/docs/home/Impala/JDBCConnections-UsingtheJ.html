JDBC Connections

   You can connect to Impala through a JDBC client tool, such as the
   SQuirreL client. You can also use the driver in a Maven application.

Using the JDBC Driver with a Client Application

   You can download the Impala JDBC driver from
   [1]http://package.mapr.com/tools/MapR-JDBC/MapR_Impala/MapR_Impala_jdbc
   _v1.0.46.1057/. After downloading the driver, refer to the
   documentation at [2]Impala JDBC Driver to install and configure the
   JDBC driver.
   Before you connect to Impala from a JDBC client tool, complete the
   following tasks:
    1. Configuring the JDBC Port. The default JDBC port that Impala
       accepts connections through is port 21050. Verify that this port
       can communicate with other hosts on your network. If your JDBC
       application connects through a different port, use the - - hs2_port
       option when you start impalad to specify the port number.
    2. Enable the JDBC driver on client machines. The JDBC driver is
       packaged in JAR files. From a system that has Hive installed,
       download the following JAR files to each client machine:
          + The JDBC driver is in
            /opt/mapr/hive/hive-2.1/lib/hive-jdbc-2.1.1-mapr-1710.jar.
          + The hadoop-common-2.7.0 jar file for MRv2 (YARN) is in
            /opt/mapr/hadoop/hadoop-2.7.0/share/hadoop/common.
          + The other required JAR files are in
            /opt/mapr/hive/hive-2.1/lib/.
       Download the following JARs:
commons-logging-1.1.3.jar
guava-14.0.1.jar
hive-exec-2.1.1-mapr-1710.jar
hive-jdbc-2.1.1-mapr-1710.jar
hive-metastore-2.1.1-mapr-1710.jar
hive-service-2.1.1-mapr-1710.jar
hive-shims-2.1.1-mapr-1710.jar
httpclient-4.4.jar
httpcore-4.4.jar
libfb303-0.9.2.jar
libthrift-0.9.2.jar
       Note: You may have a different Hive 2.1 version installed. This
       list pertains to the 1710 version of Hive 2.1.You also need the
       slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar and slf4j-log4j12-1.7.5.jar files, which are
       available in /opt/mapr/lib.
    3. Update the CLASSPATH. The client application needs to locate the
       JAR files. Set the CLASSPATH for the client process to include the
       JARs. Consult the documentation for your JDBC client application
       for more details on how to install new JDBC drivers.
       If the existing CLASSPATH on your client machine refers to an older
       version of the Hive JARs, verify that the new JARs are listed
       first. You can put the new JAR files ahead of the older JAR files,
       or delete the other references to Hive JAR files.
    4. Specify a connection string to establish a connection between
       Impala and JDBC. The JDBC driver classpath is
       org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver.Use the following connection string
       to establish the connection:
jdbc:hive2://host:port/;auth=noSasl
       Example:
jdbc:hive2://myhost.example.com:21050/;auth=noSasl

Using the JDBC Driver in a Maven Application

   To use the JDBC driver in a Maven application, complete the following
   steps:
    1. Configure a MapR Maven repository. Refer to [3]Maven Artifacts for
       MapR to configure MapRâ€™s Maven repository in your Java application.
    2. Add the following dependency in the pom.xml:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.hive</groupId>
    <artifactId>hive-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>0.12-mapr[[mapr-version-number]]</version>
</dependency>
    3. Specify the connection string in the Java application. The
       following code shows a working example:
import java.sql.*;
public class ImpalaJdbcExample
{
       private static String connectionString = "jdbc:hive2://10.10.80.231:21050
/;auth=noSasl";
       private static String driverName = "org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver";
       private static String queryString = "select count(*) from customers";
       private static Connection con;
       private static ResultSet resultSet;
       private static Statement sqlStatement;
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
               System.out.println("Loaded the driver successfully. Trying to est
ablish connection");
               try
               {
                       Class.forName(driverName);
                       con = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionString);
                       System.out.println("Created connection. Preparing stateme
nt");
                       sqlStatement = con.createStatement();
                       System.out.println("Executing "+queryString);
                       resultSet = sqlStatement.executeQuery(queryString);
                       while(resultSet.next())
                       {
                               System.out.println("Result set "+resultSet.getStr
ing(1));
                       }
                       con.close();
               }
               catch(SQLException sqle)
               {
                       System.out.println("Got sql exception");
                       sqle.printStackTrace();
               }
               catch(Exception e)
               {
                       System.out.println("Got exception");
                       e.printStackTrace();
               }
       }
}
