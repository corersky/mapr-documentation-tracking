Impala Built-In Functions

   You can use built-in functions to transform data directly in SELECT
   statements to avoid post processing in another application. Built-in
   functions allow an SQL query to return result sets with formatting,
   calculating, and type conversions already applied.

   Impala supports the following categories of functions:
     * Aggregation Functions
     * Type Conversion Functions
     * Mathematical Functions
     * Date and Time Functions
     * String Functions
     * Conditional Functions
     * Bit Manipulation Functions
     * Analytic Window Functions
     * Miscellaneous Functions

   The following table provides a few rules that apply to built-in
   functions:
   Rule                                                                  Example

   Call functions through the SELECT statement.

   You can omit the FROM clause in most functions.

   Supply literal values for any required arguments.
select abs(-1);

select concat('The sly ', 'brown
                  fox');

select power(2,5);

   When you include a FROM clause and specify a

   column name as a function argument, the function

   is applied to each item in the result set.
select concat('State = ',state_code) from
                  all_states where population > 20000000;

select round(price) as dollar_value
                    from product_directory where price between 400.0 and
              500.0;

   If an argument to a built-in function is NULL, the result value NULL.
select cos(null);

select power(2,null);

select
              concat('a',null,'b');

   Aggregate functions require a FROM clause in the query.

   They calculate a return value across all items in a result set.

   Aggregate functions ignore NULL values rather than returning a NULL
   result.

select count(customer_id) from
                  customer_directory;

select max(weight), avg(weight) from
                  census_data where age > 40;

   The following sections list the available functions:

Aggregation Functions

   You can use the following aggregation functions:
     * APPX_MEDIAN()
     * AVG()
     * COUNT()
     * MAX()
     * MIN()
     * NDV()
     * STDDEV()
     * STDDEV_SAMP()
     * STDDEV_POP()
     * SUM()
     * VARIANCE()
     * VARIANCE_SAMP()
     * VARIANCE_POP()

Type Conversion Functions

   Use conversion functions in combination with other functions to
   explicitly pass the expected data types.

   CAST
          Use CAST when passing a column value or literal to a function
          that expects a parameter with a different type.
          Syntax

cast(expr as type)

          Example

select concat('Here are the first ',10,' results.'); -- Fails
select concat('Here are the first ',cast(10 as string),' results.'); -- Succeeds

   TYPEOF
          Available as of Impala 2.5.0. Use typeof to reutrn the name of
          the data type corresponding to an expression. For types with
          extra attributes, such as length for CHAR and VARCHAR, or
          precision and scale for DECIMAL, includes the full specification
          of the type.
          Syntax

typeof(type value)

          Examples

select typeof(2);
select typeof('xyz');
select typeof(5.30001 / 2342.1);

          The examples above return tinyint, string, and DECIMAL(13,11)
          respectively.

Mathematical Functions

   The following functions were added in Impala 2.5.0:
     * dceil(double a), dceil(decimal(p,s) a)
     * dexp(double a)
     * dfloor(double a), dfloor(decimal(p,s) a)
     * dlog10(double a)
     * dpow(double a, double p), fpow(double a, double p)
     * dround(double a), dround(double a, int d), dround(decimal(p,s) a,
       int_type d)
     * dsqrt(double a)
     * dtrunc(double_or_decimal a[, digits_to_leave])
     * factorial(integer_type a)
     * radians(double a)
     * random(), random(int seed)

   The following table lists the mathematical functions with their
   descriptions and return types:
   Function Description Return type
   abs(double a) Ensures all return values are positive. Returns the
   absolute value of the argument. double
   acos(double a) Returns the arccosine of the argument. double
   asin(double a) Returns the arcsine of the argument. double
   bin(bigint a) Returns the binary representation of an integer value.
   string
   ceil(double a), ceiling(double a),dceil(double a), dceil(decimal(p,s)
   a) Returns the smallest integer > or = to the argument. int or
   decimal(p,s) depending on the type of the input argument
   conv(bigint num, int from_base, int to_base), conv(string num, int
   from_base, int to_base)

   Returns a string representation of an integer value in a particular
   base. The input value can be a string. To use the return value as a
   number, use CAST() to convert to the appropriate type.

   string
   cos(double a) Returns the cosine of the argument. double
   cot(double a) Returns the cotangent of the argument. double
   degrees(double a) Converts the argument value from radians to degrees.
   double
   e() Returns the mathematical constant e. double
   exp(double a),

   dexp(double a)
   Returns the mathematical constant e raised to the power of the
   argument. double
   factorial(integer_type a)

   Computes the factorial of an integer value. It works with any integer
   type. You can use either the factorial() function or the ! operator.
   The factorial of 0 is 1. Likewise, the factorial() function returns 1
   for any negative value. The maximum positive value for the input
   argument is 20; a value of 21 or greater overflows the range for a
   BIGINT and causes an error.
   bigint
   floor(double a), dfloor(double a), dfloor(decimal(p,s) a) Returns the
   largest integer that is less than or equal to the argument. int,
   bigint, or decimal(p,s) depending on the type of the input argument
   fnv_hash(type v) Returns a consistent 64-bit value, derived from the
   input argument. Use for implementing hashing logic in an application.
   bigint
   greatest() Returns the largest value from a list of expressions. The
   return type is the same as the initial argument value. Integer values
   are promoted to BIGINT. Floating-point values are promoted to DOUBLE.
   Use CAST() when inserting into a smaller numeric column.
   hex(bigint a), hex(string a) Returns the hexadecimal representation of
   an integer value, or of the characters in a string. string
   is_inf(double a) Tests whether a value is equal to the special value
   "inf", signifying infinity. boolean
   is_nan(double a) Tests whether a value is equal to the special value
   "NaN", signifying "not a number". boolean
   least() Returns the smallest value from a list of expressions. The
   return type is the same as the initial argument value. Integer values
   are promoted to BIGINT. Floating-point values are promoted to DOUBLE.
   Use CAST() when inserting into a smaller numeric column.
   ln(double a) Returns the natural logarithm of the argument. double
   log(double base, double a) Returns the logarithm of the second argument
   to the specified base. double
   log10(double a), dlog10(double a) Returns the logarithm of the argument
   to the base 10. double
   log2(double a) Returns the logarithm of the argument to the base 2.
   double
   mod() This function returns the modulus of a number. MOD is equivalent
   to using the % arithmetic operator. It works with any size integer
   type, any size floating-point type, and DECIMAL with any precision and
   scale. Same as the input value

   negative(int a), negative(double a)

   Returns the argument with the sign reversed; returns a positive value
   if the argument was already negative.

   If return values must be negative, use -abs(a) instead.
   int or double
   max_int(),min_smallint() Checks whether data values are in an expected
   range. You might be able to switch a column to a smaller type to save
   memory during processing. The same as the integral type being checked.
   pi() Returns the constant pi. double
   pmod(int a, int b), pmod(double a, double b) Purpose: Returns the
   positive modulus of a number. int or double

   positive(int a), positive(double a)

   Returns the original argument; applies to negative arguments also.

   If return values must be positive, use abs().
   int or double
   pow(double a, double p), power(double a, double p), dpow(double a,
   double p), fpow(double a, double p) Returns the first argument raised
   to the power of the second argument. double
   quotient(int numerator, int denominator) Returns the first argument
   divided by the second argument and discards any fractional part. Avoids
   promoting arguments to DOUBLE as happens with the / SQL operator. int
   radians(double a) Converts argument value from degrees to radians.
   double
   rand(), rand(int seed), random(), random(int seed) Returns a random
   value between 0 and 1. After rand() is called with a seed argument,
   produces a consistent random sequence based on the seed value.
   Currently, the random sequence is reset after each query, and multiple
   calls to rand() within the same query return the same value each time.
   For different number sequences that are different for each query, pass
   a unique seed value to each call to rand(). For example, select
   rand(unix_timestamp()) from ... double
   round(double a), round(double a, int d), dround(double a),
   dround(double a, int d), dround(decimal(p,s) a, int_type d) Rounds a
   floating-point value. By default (with a single argument), rounds to
   the nearest integer. Values ending in .5 are rounded up for positive
   numbers, down for negative numbers. The second argument is optional and
   specifies how many digits to leave after the decimal point. Values
   greater than zero produce a floating-point return value rounded to the
   requested number of digits to the right of the decimal point. bigint
   for single and double argument; double for two-argument signature when
   second argument is greater than zero; for DECIMAL values, the smallest
   DECIMAL(p,s) type with appropriate precision and scale
   sign(double a) Returns -1, 0, or 1 to indicate the sign of the argument
   value. int
   sin(double a) Returns the sine of the argument. double
   sqrt(double a), dsqrt(double a) Returns the square root of the
   argument. double
   tan(double a) Returns the tangent of the argument. double
   truncate(double_or_decimal a[, digits_to_leave]),
   dtrunc(double_or_decimal a[, digits_to_leave]) Removes some or all
   fractional digits from a numeric value. With no argument, removes all
   fractional digits, leaving an integer value. The optional argument
   specifies the number of fractional digits to include in the return
   value, and only applies with the argument type is DECIMAL. truncate()
   and dtrunc() are aliases for the same function. decimal for DECIMAL
   arguments; bigint for DOUBLE arguments
   unhex(string a) Returns a string of characters with ASCII values
   corresponding to pairs of hexadecimal digits in the argument. string

Date and Time Functions

   TIMESTAMP is the underlying datatype for data and time data. Functions
   that extract a single field, such as hour() or minute(), typically
   return an integer value. Functions that format the date portion, such
   as date_add() or to_date(), typically return a string value.
   The following table lists the date and time functions with their
   descriptions and return types:
   Function Description Return Type
   add_months() Alias for the existing MONTHS_ADD() function. timestamp
   date_add(string startdate, int days) Adds a specified number of days to
   a date represented as a string. string
   date_part() A new date and time function, similar to EXTRACT(), but
   with the order of the arguments reversed. You can also call the
   EXTRACT() function using the SQL-99 syntax, EXTRACT(unit FROM
   timestamp). These enhancements simplify the porting process for
   date-related code from other systems. int
   date_sub(string startdate, int days) Subtracts a specified number of
   days from a date represented as a string. string
   datediff(string enddate, string startdate) Returns the number of days
   between two dates represented as strings. int
   day(string date), dayofmonth(string date) Returns the day field from a
   date represented as a string. int
   dayname(string date) Returns the day field from a date represented as a
   string, converted to the string corresponding to that day name. The
   range of return values is 'Sunday' to 'Saturday'. Use in
   report-generating queries, instead of calling dayofweek() and turning
   that numeric return value into a string using a CASE expression. string
   dayofweek(string date) Returns the day field from a date represented as
   a string, corresponding to the day of the week. The range of return
   values is 1 (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday). int
   extract() Returns one date or time field from a TIMESTAMP value.
   timestamp
   from_unixtime(bigint unixtime[, string format]) Converts the number of
   seconds from the Unix epoch to the specified time into a string. string
   from_utc_timestamp(timestamp, string timezone) Converts a specified UTC
   timestamp value into the appropriate value for a specified time zone.
   timestamp
   hour(string date) Returns the hour field from a date represented as a
   string. int
   int_months_between(timestamp newer, timestamp older) Available as of
   Impala 2.5.0. Returns the number of months between the date portions of
   two TIMESTAMP values, as an INT representing only the full months that
   passed. int
   minute(string date) Returns the minute field from a date represented as
   a string. int
   month(string date) Returns the month field from a date represented as a
   string. int
   months_between(timestamp newer, timestamp older) Available as of Impala
   2.5.0. Returns the number of months between the date portions of two
   TIMESTAMP values. Can include a fractional part representing extra days
   in addition to the full months between the dates. The fractional
   component is computed by dividing the difference in days by 31
   (regardless of the month). double
   now() Returns the current date and time (in the UTC time zone) as a
   timestamp value. timestamp
   second(string date) Returns the second field from a date represented as
   a string. int
   timeofday() Available as of Impala 2.5.0. Returns a string
   representation of the current date and time, according to the time of
   the local system, including any time zone designation. string
   timestamp_cmp(timestamp t1, timestamp t2) Available as of Impala 2.5.0.
   Tests if one TIMESTAMP value is newer than, older than, or identical to
   another TIMESTAMP int (either -1, 0, 1, or NULL)
   to_date(string timestamp) Returns the date field from a timestamp
   represented as a string. string
   to_utc_timestamp(timestamp, string timezone) Converts a specified
   timestamp value in a specified time zone into the corresponding value
   for the UTC time zone. timestamp
   trunc() Truncates date/time values to a particular granularity, such as
   year, month, day, hour, and so on.
   unix_timestamp(), unix_timestamp(string date), unix_timestamp(string
   date, string pattern) Returns a timestamp representing the current date
   and time, or converts from a specified date and time value represented
   as a string. bigint

   date represented as a string. int
   year(string date) Returns the year field from a date represented as a
   string. int

String Functions

   The following table lists the string functions with their descriptions
   and return types:
   Function Description Return Type
   ascii(string str) Returns the numeric ASCII code of the first character
   of the argument. int
   btrim(string a), btrim(string a, string chars_to_trim) Available as of
   Impala 2.5.0. Removes all instances of one or more characters from the
   start and end of a STRING value. By default, removes only spaces. If a
   non-NULL optional second argument is specified, the function removes
   all occurrences of characters in that second argument from the
   beginning and end of the string. string
   chr(int character_code) Available as of Impala 2.5.0. Returns a
   character specified by a decimal code point value. The interpretation
   and display of the resulting character depends on your system locale.
   Because consistent processing of Impala string values is only
   guaranteed for values within the ASCII range, only use this function
   for values corresponding to ASCII characters. In particular, parameter
   values greater than 255 return an empty string. string
   concat(string a, string b...) Returns a single string representing all
   the argument values joined together. string
   concat_ws(string sep, string a, string b...) Returns a single string
   representing the second and following argument values joined together,
   delimited by a specified separator. string

   find_in_set(string str, string strList)

   Returns the position (starting from 1) of the first occurrence of a
   specified string within a comma-separated string. Returns NULL if
   either argument is NULL, 0 if the search string is not found, or 0 if
   the search string contains a comma. int
   initcap(string str) Returns the input string with the first letter
   capitalized. string
   instr(string str, string substr) Returns the position (starting from 1)
   of the first occurrence of a substring within a longer string. int
   length(string a) Returns the length in characters of the argument
   string. int

   (starting from 1) of the first occurrence of a substring within a
   longer string, optionally after a particular position. int
   lower(string a), lcase(string a) Returns the argument string converted
   to all-lowercase. string

   lpad(string str, int len, string pad)

   Returns a string of a specified length, based on the first argument
   string. If the specified string is too short, it is padded on the left
   with a repeating sequence of the characters from the pad string. If the
   specified string is too long, it is truncated on the right. string
   ltrim(string a) Returns the argument string with any leading spaces
   removed from the left side. string
   parse_url(string urlString, string partToExtract [, string
   keyToExtract])

   Returns the portion of a URL corresponding to a specified part. The
   part argument can be 'PROTOCOL', 'HOST', 'PATH', 'REF', 'AUTHORITY',
   'FILE', 'USERINFO', or 'QUERY'. Literal values must be uppercase. You
   can specify a key to retrieve only the associated value from the
   key-value pairs in the query string when you request the query portion
   of the URL. Useful for importing web logs.

   string
   regexp_extract(string subject, string pattern, int index) Returns the
   specified () group from a string based on a regular expression pattern.
   string
   regexp_like(string source, string pattern[, string options]) Available
   as of Impala 2.5.0. Returns true or false to indicate whether the
   source string contains anywhere inside it the regular expression given
   by the pattern. The optional third argument consists of letter flags
   that change how the match is performed, such as i for case-insensitive
   matching. boolean
   regexp_replace(string initial, string pattern, string replacement)
   Returns the initial argument with the regular expression pattern
   replaced by the final argument string. string
   repeat(string str, int n) Returns the argument string repeated a
   specified number of times. string
   reverse(string a) Purpose: Returns the argument string with characters
   in reversed order. string

   rpad(string str, int len, string pad)

   Returns a string of a specified length, based on the first argument
   string. If the specified string is too short, it is padded on the right
   with a repeating sequence of the characters from the pad string. If the
   specified string is too long, it is truncated on the right. string
   rtrim(string a) Returns the argument string with any trailing spaces
   removed from the right side. string
   space(int n) Returns a concatenated string of the specified number of
   spaces. Shorthand for repeat(' ',n). string
   split_part(string source, string delimiter, bigint n) Available as of
   Impala 2.5.0. Returns the nth field within a delimited string. The
   fields are numbered starting from 1. The delimiter can consist of
   multiple characters, not just a single character. All matching of the
   delimiter is done exactly, not using any regular expression patterns.
   string
   substr(string a, int start [, int len]), substring(string a, int start
   [, int len]) Returns the portion of the string starting at a specified
   point, optionally with a specified maximum length. The characters in
   the string are indexed starting at 1. string
   translate(string input, string from, string to) Returns the input
   string with a set of characters replaced by another set of characters.
   string
   trim(string a) Returns the input string with leading and trailing
   spaces removed. The same as passing the string through both ltrim() and
   rtrim(). string
   upper(string a), ucase(string a) Returns the argument string converted
   to all-uppercase. string

Conditional Functions

   Use the conditional functions to test equality, comparison operators,
   and nullity.
   The following table lists the conditional functions with their
   descriptions and return types:
   Function Description Return Type
   CASE a WHEN b THEN c [WHEN d THEN e]... [ELSE f] END Compares an
   expression to one or more possible values, and returns a corresponding
   result when a match is found. Same as the initial argument value
   CASE WHEN a THEN b [WHEN c THEN d]... [ELSE e] END Tests whether any of
   a sequence of expressions is true, and returns a corresponding result
   for the first true expression. Same as the initial argument value
   coalesce(type v1, type v2, ...) Returns the first specified argument
   that is not NULL, or NULL if all arguments are NULL. Same as the
   initial argument value
   decode() Compares an expression to one or more possible values and
   returns a corresponding result when a match is found. This function
   works as a shorthand for a CASE() expression and improves compatibility
   with SQL code containing vendor extensions. Same as the initial
   argument value, except that integer values are promoted to BIGINT and
   floating-point values are promoted to DOUBLE; use CAST() when inserting
   into a smaller numeric column
   if(boolean condition, type ifTrue, type ifFalseOrNull) Tests an
   expression and returns a corresponding result depending on whether the
   result is true, false, or NULL. Same as ifTrue argument value
   isfalse(), isnotfalse(), isnottrue(), istrue(), notnullvalue(),
   nullvalue() These conditional functions provide enhanced compatibility
   when porting code that uses industry extensions.

   isnull(type a, type ifNotNull)

   Tests if an expression is NULL, and returns the expression result value
   if not. If the first argument is NULL, returns the second argument.
   Equivalent to the nvl() function from Oracle Database orifnull() from
   MySQL. Same as the first argument value
   nullif(expr1,expr2) Returns NULL if the two specified arguments are
   equal. If the specified arguments are not equal, returns the value of
   expr1. The data types of the expressions must be compatible. You cannot
   use an expression that evaluates to NULL for expr1, so you can
   distinguish a return value of NULL from an argument value of NULL,
   which would never match expr2. Same as the initial argument value,
   except that integer values are promoted to BIGINT and floating-point
   values are promoted to DOUBLE; use CAST() when inserting into a smaller
   numeric column
   nullifzero(numeric_expr) Returns NULL if the numeric expression
   evaluates to 0, otherwise returns the result of the expression. Same as
   the initial argument value, except that integer values are promoted to
   BIGINT and floating-point values are promoted to DOUBLE; use CAST()
   when inserting into a smaller numeric column

   nvl(type a, type ifNotNull)

   Alias for the isnull() function; added in Impala 1.1. Tests if an
   expression is NULL, and returns the expression result value if not. If
   the first argument is NULL, returns the second argument. Equivalent to
   the nvl() function from Oracle Database or ifnull() from MySQL. Same as
   the first argument value
   zeroifnull(numeric_expr) Returns 0 if the numeric expression evaluates
   to NULL, otherwise returns the result of the expression. Same as the
   initial argument value, except that integer values are promoted to
   BIGINT and floating-point values are promoted to DOUBLE; use CAST()
   when inserting into a smaller numeric column

Bit Manipulation Functions

   Impala 2.5.0 introduces bit manipulation functions.

   The following table lists the bit manipulation functions with their
   descriptions and return types:
   Function Description Return Type
   bitand(integer_type a, same_type b)

   Returns an integer value representing the bits that are set to 1 in
   both of the arguments. If the arguments are of different sizes, the
   smaller is promoted to the type of the larger. The bitand() function is
   equivalent to the & binary operator.
   Same as the input value
   bitnot(integer_type a)

   Inverts all the bits of the input argument. The bitnot() function is
   equivalent to the ~ unary operator.
   Same as the input value
   bitor(integer_type a, same_type b)

   Returns an integer value representing the bits that are set to 1 in
   either of the arguments. If the arguments are of different sizes, the
   smaller is promoted to the type of the larger. The bitor() function is
   equivalent to the | binary operator.
   Same as the input value
   bitxor(integer_type a, same_type b)

   Returns an integer value representing the bits that are set to 1 in one
   but not both of the arguments. If the arguments are of different sizes,
   the smaller is promoted to the type of the larger. The bitxor()
   function is equivalent to the ^ binary operator.
   Same as the input value
   countset(integer_type a [, int zero_or_one])

   By default, returns the number of 1 bits in the specified integer
   value. If the optional second argument is set to zero, it returns the
   number of 0 bits instead.
   Same as the input value
   getbit(integer_type a, int position)

   Returns a 0 or 1 representing the bit at a specified position. The
   positions are numbered right to left, starting at zero. The position
   argument cannot be negative. When you use a literal input value, it is
   treated as an 8-bit, 16-bit, and so on value, the smallest type that is
   appropriate. The type of the input value limits the range of the
   positions. Cast the input value to the appropriate type if you need to
   ensure it is treated as a 64-bit, 32-bit, and so on value.
   Same as the input value
   rotateleft(integer_type a, int positions)

   Rotates an integer value left by a specified number of bits. As the
   most significant bit is taken out of the original value, if it is a 1
   bit, it is "rotated" back to the least significant bit. Therefore, the
   final value has the same number of 1 bits as the original value, just
   in different positions. Specifying a second argument of zero leaves the
   original value unchanged. Rotating a -1 value by any number of
   positions still returns -1, because the original value has all 1 bits
   and all the 1 bits are preserved during rotation. Similarly, rotating a
   0 value by any number of positions still returns 0. Rotating a value by
   the same number of bits as in the value returns the same value. Because
   this is a circular operation, the number of positions is not limited to
   the number of bits in the input value. For example, rotating an 8-bit
   value by 1, 9, 17, and so on positions returns an identical result in
   each case.
   Same as the input value
   rotateright(integer_type a, int positions)

   Rotates an integer value right by a specified number of bits. As the
   least significant bit is taken out of the original value, if it is a 1
   bit, it is "rotated" back to the most significant bit. Therefore, the
   final value has the same number of 1 bits as the original value, just
   in different positions. Specifying a second argument of zero leaves the
   original value unchanged. Rotating a -1 value by any number of
   positions still returns -1, because the original value has all 1 bits
   and all the 1 bits are preserved during rotation. Similarly, rotating a
   0 value by any number of positions still returns 0. Rotating a value by
   the same number of bits as in the value returns the same value. Because
   this is a circular operation, the number of positions is not limited to
   the number of bits in the input value. For example, rotating an 8-bit
   value by 1, 9, 17, and so on positions returns an identical result in
   each case.
   Same as the input value
   setbit(integer_type a, int position [, int zero_or_one]) By default,
   changes a bit at a specified position to a 1, if it is not already. If
   the optional third argument is set to zero, the specified bit is set to
   0 instead. If the bit at the specified position was already 1 (by
   default) or 0 (with a third argument of zero), the return value is the
   same as the first argument. The positions are numbered right to left,
   starting at zero. (Therefore, the return value could be different from
   the first argument even if the position argument is zero.) The position
   argument cannot be negative. When you use a literal input value, it is
   treated as an 8-bit, 16-bit, and so on value, the smallest type that is
   appropriate. The type of the input value limits the range of the
   positions. Cast the input value to the appropriate type if you need to
   ensure it is treated as a 64-bit, 32-bit, and so on value. Same as the
   input value
   shiftleft(integer_type a, int positions)

   Shifts an integer value left by a specified number of bits. As the most
   significant bit is taken out of the original value, it is discarded and
   the least significant bit becomes 0. The final value has either the
   same number of 1 bits as the original value, or fewer. Shifting an
   8-bit value by 8 positions, a 16-bit value by 16 positions, and so on
   produces a result of zero. Specifying a second argument of zero leaves
   the original value unchanged. Shifting any value by 0 returns the
   original value. Shifting any value by 1 is the same as multiplying it
   by 2, as long as the value is small enough; larger values eventually
   become negative when shifted, as the sign bit is set. Starting with the
   value 1 and shifting it left by N positions gives the same result as 2
   to the Nth power, or pow(2,N).
   Same as the input value
   shiftright(integer_type a, int positions)

   Shifts an integer value right by a specified number of bits. As the
   least significant bit is taken out of the original value, it is
   discarded and the most significant bit becomes 0. In computer science
   terms, this operation is a "[1]logical shift".

   Usage notes:

   Therefore, the final value has either the same number of 1 bits as the
   original value, or fewer. Shifting an 8-bit value by 8 positions, a
   16-bit value by 16 positions, and so on produces a result of zero.
   Specifying a second argument of zero leaves the original value
   unchanged. Shifting any value by 0 returns the original value. Shifting
   any positive value right by 1 is the same as dividing it by 2. Negative
   values become positive when shifted right.
   Same as the input value

Analytic Functions

   Analytic (window) functions operate on a set of rows and return a
   single value for each row from the underlying query. The term "window"
   describes the set of rows on which the function operates. A window
   function uses values from the rows in a window to calculate the
   returned values. When you use a window function in a query, you define
   the window using the OVER() clause. The OVER() clause (window clause)
   differentiates window functions from other analytical and reporting
   functions.

   As of Impala 2.2.0, you can use the following analytic functions in
   queries:
     * MAX()
     * MIN()
     * SUM()
     * COUNT()
     * AVG()
     * RANK()
     * LAG()
     * LEAD()
     * FIRST_VALUE()

   As of Impala 2.5.0, you can use the following analytic functions in
   queries:
     * PERCENT_RANK
     * NTILE
     * CUME_DIST

   The analytic functions support the following syntax:
function(args) OVER([partition_by_clause] [order_by_clause [window_clause]])
partition_by_clause ::= PARTITION BY expr [, expr ...]order_by_clause ::= ORDER
BY expr  [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST] [, expr [ASC |DESC] [NULLS FIRS
T | NULLS LAST] ...]

   The window clause supports the following syntax:
ROWS BETWEEN [ { m | UNBOUNDED } PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW] [ AND [CURRENT ROW | {
 UNBOUNDED | n } FOLLOWING] ]
RANGE BETWEEN [ {m | UNBOUNDED } PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW] [ AND [CURRENT ROW | {
 UNBOUNDED | n } FOLLOWING] ]

Miscellaneous Functions

   The following table lists miscellaneous functions with their
   descriptions and syntax:
   Function Description Syntax
   uuid() The uuid() function generates an alphanumeric value that you can
   use as a guaranteed unique identifier. The uniqueness applies across
   tables in cases where an ascending numeric sequence is not suitable.

   select uuid();
