Impala

   Note:

   SQL-on-Hadoop is an emerging space with several promising open-source
   technologies at various stages of maturity including Apache Drill,
   Apache Hive-on-Tez, Impala, Presto, Shark-on-Spark, Phoenix. MapR
   provides the broadest availability of these options to ensure that
   customers can pick the right tool for their use case.

   MapR announces availability of Impala packages for MapR Converged Data
   Platform. With this, customers can easily install and run Impala on
   MapR clusters and evaluate its fit for their use cases. MapR will also
   provide build and installation support to help customers get started.

Overview

   Impala is an open source, interactive SQL engine for Hadoop that you
   can use to access data on MapR. With Impala, you can use business
   intelligence (BI) tools to run ad-hoc queries directly on Hadoop.
   Impala provides the following benefits:
     * Broad availability of Hadoop data to the business community
     * Leverages familiar SQL tools and skill sets on Hadoop
     * Full fidelity data analysis
     * Cost savings by offloading from traditional DWH/Analytics platforms
     * Time savings because you do not have to move around data

   Impala uses the Apache Hive query language (HiveQL) and Hive metadata.
   You can use the most common SQL-92 features of HiveQL, including
   SELECT, joins, and aggregate functions to query data in your cluster.
   You can issue queries from the impala-shell command-line tool, or
   through an ODBC or JDBC client. When you submit a query, Impala works
   with other components in the cluster to process the query.

   Impala uses the Hive metastore to store metadata. The Hive metastore is
   typically the same database that Hive uses to store metadata. Impala
   can access tables you create in Hive when they contain datatypes, file
   formats, and compression codecs that Impala supports.

   If you have MapR Database configured to store table data, you can
   define the tables in Hive and then map them to equivalent tables in
   MapR Database. After you map the tables, you can use Impala to query
   the MapR Database tables and perform table joins between MapR Database
   and Hive tables.

   The following table contains a list of components that work together to
   process a query issued to Impala:

   CAPTION:

   Component

   Description

   Clients

   The impala-shell, JDBC client, or ODBC client that you connect to
   Impala from. You issue a query to Impala from the client.

   Hive Metastore

   Stores information about the tables that Impala can access.

   Impala (impalad, statestored, catalogd)

   Impalad is a process that runs on designated nodes in the cluster. It
   coordinates and runs queries. Each node running the Impala process can
   receive, plan, and coordinate queries sent from a client. Statestored
   tracks the state of the Impalad processes in the cluster. Catalogd
   communicates new or updated metadata to all the other Impala nodes when
   Impala changes table data or metadata on a node.

   MapR Filesystem/MapR Database

   MapR Filesystem is the MapR file system that stores data files and
   tables. MapR Database stores MapR tables natively.

Impala Daemon

   The Impala daemon (impalad) is the core Impala process. Install the
   impala server package on all nodes that you want to run the Impala
   service on. You can submit queries to any node configured with the
   Impala daemon. When you submit a query to a node running the Impala
   daemon process, the node becomes the central coordinator for the query.
   The coordinator distributes work to the other nodes running the Impala
   daemon process to complete the query request.

   The coordinator node running the Impala daemon process completes the
   following tasks:
     * Accepts the query from the client
     * Parallelizes queries and distributes pieces of the query to other
       impalad nodes
     * Receives query results from other impalad nodes
     * Builds the final result set for the query and passes it to the
       client
     * Communicates with the statestore service

   All nodes running the Impala daemon process perform the following
   tasks:
     * Read and write data to files
     * Transmit partial query results back to the coordinator
     * Communicate with the statestore service

Impala Statestore

   The Impala statestore service (statestored) verifies the health of
   nodes running the Impala daemon process. The node running the
   statestore service communicates node health to all nodes running the
   Impala daemon process. The statestore service ensures that impalad
   nodes only pass query work to active nodes running the Impala daemon
   process.

   If the node running the statestore service goes offline, other Impala
   nodes continue the query work. If any of the other Impala nodes go
   offline while the statestore service is unavailable, query time may
   increase. The statestore service can automatically communicate with the
   Impala nodes and resume work when the node is back online.

Catalog Service

   The catalog service (catalogd) resides on the same node as statestored.
   The catalog service communicates new or updated metadata to all of the
   other Impala nodes when Impala changes table data or metadata on one
   node. You no longer need to use the REFRESH or INVALIDATE METADATA
   statements after issuing the following statements to Impala:
     *
CREATE TABLE
     *
ALTER TABLE
     *
DROP TABLE
     *
INSERT
     *
LOAD DATA

   The catalog service only works on operations performed through Impala.
   If you perform operations through the Hive shell or through MapR
   Filesystem, you must issue the REFRESH and INVALIDATE METADATA
   statements. The catalog service broadcasts the results of the REFRESH
   and INVALIDATE METADATA operations to other Impala nodes so that you
   only have to issue the statements once.

   The following image represents how the various components communicate:

Query Execution

   Each node running the Impala service can receive, plan, and coordinate
   queries. The Impala daemon process on each node listens for requests
   from ports on each client. Requests from the impala-shell are routed to
   the impala daemons through one particular port. JDBC and ODBC requests
   are routed through other ports.

   When you send a query to Impala, the client connects to a node running
   the Impala process. The node that the client connects to becomes the
   coordinator for the query.

   [impala_shell.png]

   The coordinator node parses the query into fragments and analyzes the
   query to determine what tasks the nodes running Impala must perform.
   The coordinator distributes the fragments across other nodes running
   the Impala daemon process. The nodes process the query fragments and
   return the data to the coordinator node.

   The coordinator node sends the result set back to the client.
