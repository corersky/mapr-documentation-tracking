ODBC Client Connections on Windows

   You can connect to Impala through an ODBC client tool, such as Tableau,
   from a Windows operating system. Use the MapR Impala ODBC Driver for
   SQL access to files and tables. Install the driver and configure it to
   pass a SQL query to Impala. You can run 32- and 64-bit applications on
   64-bit Windows operating systems. You can install both versions of the
   driver on the same computer, however you should use the version of the
   driver that matches the architecture of the client application running
   the query.

   Before you install the driver, verify that your system meets the
   following system prerequisites:
     * Administrator privileges on the machine.
     * One of the following operating systems (32- and 64-bit editions are
       supported):
          + Windows 7
          + Windows Server 2008 R2
          + Windows Server 2012
     * 25 MB of available disk space

   To install and the configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driver, complete the
   following steps:
    1. Download the MapR Impala ODBC Driver:
          + [1]MapRImpalaODBC32.msi (32-bit)
          + [2]MapRImpalaODBC64.msi (64-bit)
    2. Install the MapR Impala ODBC Driver on the machine that you connect
       to the Impala service from. When you install the driver, the driver
       program updates the system path to include the JVM directory. To
       install the driver:
         a. Double-click the file.
         b. Click Next.
         c. Accept the terms of the License Agreement, and click Next.
         d. Select an installation location and then click OK. To accept
            the installation location, click Next.
         e. Click Install.
         f. When the installation completes, click Finish.
    3. Configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driver. To configure the driver:
         a. Click the Windows Start button.
         b. Click All Programs.
         c. Select the MapR Impala ODBC Driver. If you installed both
            versions of the driver, two options appear. Select the version
            that matches the architecture of your application. For
            example, a DSN that is defined for the 32-bit driver will only
            be accessible from 32-bit applications.
         d. Click 64-bit ODBC Administrator or 32-bit ODBC Administrator.
            The ODBC Data Source Administrator window opens.
         e. Click the Drivers tab, and verify that the MapR Impala ODBC
            Driver appears in the list of ODBC drivers that are installed
            on your system.
         f. Click the System DSNtab to create a system DSN or click the
            User DSN tab to create a user DSN. All users that login to a
            workstation can see a system DSN. A user DSN is specific to a
            user on the workstation. Only the user who creates a user DSN
            can see it.
         g. Click Add. The Create New Data Source window opens.
         h. Select MapR Impala ODBC Driver and then click Finish. The MapR
            Impala ODBC Driver DSN Setup dialog opens.
         i. Enter the DSN information. Optionally, you can select Advanced
            Options, and enter the following information in the Advanced
            Options window:

   Option Description
   Use Native Query Select this option to disable translating ODBC SQL to
   Impala SQL. By default, the driver applies transformations to the
   queries produced by an application to convert the queries to an
   equivalent form in Impala SQL. If the application produces Impala SQL,
   you can turn off the translation to avoid additional overhead of query
   transformation.
   Rows Fetched Per Block Enter the number of rows to fetch per block. You
   can enter any positive 32-bit integer as a value.
   Socket Timeout Enter the number of seconds Impala waits to close an
   idle connection with the client application. If you want to disable
   this option, set the value to 0.
   Allow Common Name Hostname Mismatch Select this option to allow the
   common name of a CA-issued SSL certificate to mismatch the hostname of
   the Impala server. Note: This setting only applies to the User Name and
   Password (SSL) and No Authentication (SSL) authentication mechanisms.
   Other authentication mechanisms ignore this setting.
   Trusted Certificates field

   Enter the path to the file that contains the trusted certificates in
   this field to configure the driver to load trusted certificates (such
   as the certificate from the Impala server) from a specific file when
   authenticating the Impala server using SSL.
   Note: This setting only apples to the User Name and Password (SSL) and
   No Authentication (SSL) authentication mechanisms. Other authentication
   mechanisms ignore this setting. SSL certificates in the trusted
   certificates file must be in PEM format. If this setting is not set,
   then the driver defaults to using the trusted CA certificates PEM file
   installed by the driver.
         j. Click OK.
         k. Optionally, if the operations against Impala are to be done on
            behalf of a user that is different than the authenticated user
            for the connection, enter the user name of the user to be
            delegated in the Delegation UID text box.
         l. Click Test to test the connection.
         m. Review the connection test results, and click OK in the Test
            Results dialog.
         n. In the MapR Impala ODBC Driver DSN Setup dialog, click OK.
    4. Configure authentication. The Impala server supports multiple
       authentication mechanisms. You must determine the authentication
       type your server is using and configure your DSN accordingly. The
       following table provides the authentication methods available with
       configuration instructions:

   Method Configuration
   Kerberos

   Kerberos must be configured before you can use this authentication
   mechanism. For details, see [3]Configuring Kerberos Authentication for
   Windows. After Kerberos is installed and configured, configure your DSN
   to use Kerberos authentication.
   To configure your DSN to use Kerberos authentication, complete the
   following steps:
         a. In the MapR Impala ODBC Driver DSN Setup dialog, click the
            drop-down arrow next to the Mechanism field, and then select
            Kerberos
         b. If your Kerberos setup does not define a default realm or if
            the realm of your Impala server is not the default, then type
            the Kerberos realm of the Impala server host in the Realm
            field. Otherwise, leave the field blank.
         c. In the Host FQDN field, type the fully qualified domain name
            of the Impala host.
         d. In the Service Name field, type the service name of the Impala
            server.
            For example, if the principle for the Impala server is
 impala/fully.qualified.domain.name@your-realm.com
            , then the value in the service name field is impala. If you
            are unsure of the correct service name to use for your
            particular Hadoop deployment, contact your Hadoop
            administrator.
         e. In the Transport Buffer Size field, type the number of bytes
            to reserve in memory for buffering unencrypted data from the
            network.

   Note: In most circumstances, the default value of 1000 bytes is
   optimal.
   No Authentication For this authentication mechanism, you do not need to
   configure any additional settings. To configure your DSN for
   connections that do not require authentication, click the drop-down
   arrow next to the Mechanism field, and then select No Authentication in
   the driver DSN Setup dialog.
   No Authentication (SSL)

   This authentication mechanism uses SSL but does not require a user name
   or a password. The driver accepts self-signed SSL certificates.
   To configure your DSN to use No Authentication (SSL) authentication,
   complete the following steps:
         a. In the MapR Impala ODBC Driver DSN Setup dialog, click the
            drop-down arrow next to the Mechanism field, and then select
            No Authentication (SSL)
         b. Optionally, configure the driver to allow a mismatch between
            the common name of a CA-issued certificate and the host name
            of the Impala server by clicking Advanced Options and
            selecting the Allow Common Name Host Name Mismatch check box.

   Note: For self-signed certificates, the driver always allows the common
   name of the certificate to not match the host name.
   Optionally, configure the driver to load SSL certificates from a
   specific file by clicking Advanced Options and typing the path to the
   file in the Trusted Certificates field.
   Note: By default, the driver uses the trusted CA certificates PEM file
   that is installed with the driver.
   User Name

   This authentication mechanism requires a user name but does not require
   a password. The user name labels the session, facilitating database
   tracking.
   To configure your DSN to use User Name authentication, complete the
   following steps:
         a. In the MapR Impala ODBC Driver DSN Setup dialog, click the
            drop-down arrow next to the Mechanism field, and then select
            User Name
         b. In the User Name field, type a user name that is recognized by
            the Impala server.
         c. In the Transport Buffer Size field, type the number of bytes
            to reserve in memory for buffering unencrypted data from the
            network.

   Note: In most circumstances, the default value of 1000 bytes is
   optimal.
   User Name and Password

   This authentication mechanism requires a user name and a password.
   Note: This authentication mechanism should not be used with an Impala
   configuration that does not have LDAP enabled.
   To configure your DSN for User Name and Password authentication,
   complete the following steps:
         a. In the MapR Impala ODBC Driver DSN Setup dialog, click the
            drop-down arrow next to the Mechanism field, and then select
            User Name and Password
         b. In the User Name field, type a user name that is recognized by
            the Impala server.
         c. In the Password field, type the password corresponding to the
            user name you typed in step 2.

   User Name and Password (SSL)

   This authentication mechanism uses SSL and requires a user name and a
   password. The driver accepts self-signed SSL certificates.
   Note: This authentication mechanism should not be used with an Impala
   configuration that does not have LDAP enabled.
   To configure your DSN to use User Name and Password (SSL)
   authentication, complete the following steps:
         a. In the MapR Impala ODBC Driver DSN Setup dialog, click the
            drop-down arrow next to the Mechanism field, and then select
            User Name and Password (SSL)
         b. In the User Name field, type a user name that is recognized by
            the Impala server.
         c. In the Password field, type the password corresponding to the
            user name you typed in step 2.
         d. Optionally, configure the driver to allow a mismatch between
            the common name of a CA-issued certificate and the host name
            of the Impala server by clicking Advanced Options and
            selecting the Allow Common Name Host Name Mismatch check box.

   Note: For self-signed certificates, the driver always allows the common
   name of the certificate to not match the host name
   Optionally, configure the driver to load SSL certificates from a
   specific file by clicking Advanced Options and typing the path to the
   file in the Trusted Certificates field.
   Note: By default, the driver uses the trusted CA certificates PEM file
   that is installed with the driver.
