Configure Impala to Use Sentry Authorization in File-Based Storage Model

   When Impala starts, it reads the file and controls what objects that
   users who connect to Impala can access and what operations they can
   perform on the objects. Impala caches the security information from in
   the policy file every five minutes. If you make significant changes to
   security policies, restart Impala so that the changes become effective
   immediately.

    1. Edit env.sh located in /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/.
    2. In the IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS declaration, add the following options:

   Option Description
   -server_name This option turns on Sentry authorization for Impala.
   Specify the symbolic server name to use as the argument for this
   option. You must also specify this server name as the value for the
   sentry.hive.server property in the sentry-site.xml configuration file
   for Hive.

   For example: -server_name=<hive_server_2>
   -authorization_policy_file You can store privileges in an authorization
   policy file. When you specify this option, in addition to the
   server_name option, Impala reads privilege information from the policy
   file instead of a database. Specify the MapR file system path to the
   policy file that contains the privilege information.

   For example: -
   authorization_policy_file=file:///opt/mapr/sentry/sentry-/conf/.ini \

   Note: If the policy file is stored in MapR file system, indicate the
   MapR file system location using the following format:
   -authorization_policy_file=maprfs:///<path_to_policy_file>
    3. Restart the Impala server, statestore service, and catalog service.
sudo -u mapr maprcli node services -name impalaserver -action restart -nodes <no
dename>
sudo -u mapr maprcli node services -name impalastore -action restart -nodes <nod
ename>
sudo -u mapr maprcli node services -name impalacatalog -action restart -nodes <n
odename>
       Note: Impala does not start if it detects any issues in the
       authorization settings or the policy file.
    4. When Impala is running, you can issue the following command to
       start the impala-shell as a particular user:
impala-shell -u <user_name>
