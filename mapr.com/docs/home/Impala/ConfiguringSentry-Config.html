Configure Impala to Use Sentry Authorization

   You can configure Impala to work with Sentry for authorization. When
   you configure Sentry authorization for Impala, Impala uses operating
   system IDs to associate privileges with each user that runs the
   impala-shell or client program.
   Before you can configure Impala for Sentry authorization, you must have
   Hive and Sentry installed and configured to work together.
