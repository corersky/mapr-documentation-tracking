Writing UDAFs

   A UDAF must maintain a state value across subsequent calls in order to
   accumulate a result across a set of calls, instead of deriving it
   purely from one set of arguments.
   The underlying functions represent a UDAF:

   Initialization function
          Sets counters to zero, creates empty buffers, and performs any
          other initial setup for a query.

   Update function
          Processes the arguments for each row in the result set and
          accumulates an intermediate result for each node.

   Merge function
          Combines the intermediate results from different nodes.

   Finalize function
          Passes through the combined result unchanged, or does one final
          transformation.
