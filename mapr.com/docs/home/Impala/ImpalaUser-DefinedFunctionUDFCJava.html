UDFs in C++ and Java

   Impala accepts UDFs and UDAFs written in C++, as well as Hive UDFs
   written in Java. A Java UDF may cause a query in Impala to run much
   slower than the equivalent native UDF written in C++. If you use Hive
   UDFs when you query Impala, the Hive UDFs must meet the following
   conditions:
     * Parameters and return values must all use data types that Impala
       accepts. Impala does not accept nested and composite types.
     * UDFs cannot accept or return the TIMESTAMP data type.
     * The return type must be a writable type, like Text or IntWritable.
       UDFs return a NULL value for Java primitive types, like string or
       int.
     * Impala does not accept Hive UDAFs or UDTFs.

   For more information about Hive UDFs, refer to the [1]Hive Language
   Manual UDF.
