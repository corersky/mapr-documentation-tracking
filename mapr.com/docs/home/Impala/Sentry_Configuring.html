Configuring Sentry

   The steps to configure Sentry are determined by the storage model, the
   type of security used by the cluster, and the components that will use
   Sentry authorization.
    1. Configure Sentry to use one of the following storage models:
       file-based storage or database storage.
    2. If the cluster is secure, you can configure Sentry to use kerberos
       authentication.
    3. Based on your requirements, complete the steps to integrate Sentry
       with one or more ecosystem components.
