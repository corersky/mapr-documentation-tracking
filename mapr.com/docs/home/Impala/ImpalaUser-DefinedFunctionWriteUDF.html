Writing UDFs

   When you write UDFs, use function-oriented programming best practices,
   and note data type differences when transferring values from high-level
   SQL to low-level UDF code.

   The UDF code samples that you downloaded include the udf-sample.h and
   udf-sample.cc files that you can reference when you write your UDFs.
   The udf-sample.h file provides the basic declarations required to write
   a scalar UDF. This file defines a simple function named AddUdf() that
   you can reference. The udf-sample.cc file provides sample C++ code for
   a simple function named AddUdf().
