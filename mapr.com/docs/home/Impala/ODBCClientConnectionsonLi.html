ODBC Client Connections on Linux

   You can use an ODBC client tool to connect to Impala from Linux.
   Install the driver and configure it to pass a SQL query to Impala.
   After you install the driver, [1]Configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driver
   for Linux and Mac OS X.

   Before you install the driver, verify that your system meets the
   following system prerequisites:
     * RedHat 6.x or CentOS 6.x
     * 50 MB of available disk space
     * An installed ODBC driver manager, such as unixODBC 2.3.0/2.3.1 or
       iODBC 3.52.7

   To install and configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driver, complete the
   following steps:
    1. Download the MapR Impala ODBC Driver. You can install the 32- or
       64-bit driver on Linux. Download and install the version of the
       driver that matches the architecture of the client application that
       you use to access Impala. The 64-bit editions of Linux support 32-
       and 64-bit applications.
       Click on the link to download the driver appropriate for your
       system:

      Operating System Version                      Drivers
      RedHat           6.x     [2]MapRImpalaODBC-1.2.1.1001-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
                               [3]MapRImpalaODBC-32bit-1.2.1.1001-1.el6.i686.rpm
    2. Install the MapR Impala ODBC Driver on the machine that you connect
       to the Impala service from.
         a. Login as root.
         b. Navigate to the folder that contains the driver RPM packages
            to install.
         c. Enter the following command where RPMFileName is the file name
            of the RPM package containing the version of the driver that
            you want to install:
yum localinstall --nogpgcheck RPMFileName
            MapR Impala ODBC Driver files install in the following
            locations:
               o /opt/mapr/impalaodbc/ErrorMessages – Error messages files
                 directory
               o /opt/mapr/impalaodbc/Setup – Sample configuration files
                 directory
               o /opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/32 – 32-bit shared libraries
                 directory
               o /opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/64 – 64-bit shared libraries
                 directory
            The MapR Impala ODBC Driver depends on the following
            resources:
               o cyrus-sasl-2.1.22-7 or above
               o cyrus-sasl-gssapi-2.1.22-7 or above
               o cyrus-sasl-plain-2.1.22-7 or above
            If the package manager in your Linux or Mac OS X distribution
            cannot resolve the dependencies automatically when installing
            the driver, download and manually install the packages.
    3. Set the shared LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Update the
       shared library environment variable to include the paths to the
       following directories:
          + Installed ODBC driver manager libraries
          + Installed MapR Impala ODBC Driver for Impala shared libraries
            Note: You can have both 32- and 64-bit versions of the driver
            installed at the same time on the same computer, but do not
            include the paths to both 32- and 64-bit shared libraries in
            LD_LIBRARY PATH at the same time. Only include the path to the
            shared libraries that correspond to the driver matching the
            architecture of the client application used. For example, if
            you are using a 64-bit client application and ODBC driver
            manager libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib, then set
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/64

   Next Step: [4]Configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driver for Linux and Mac
   OS X.
