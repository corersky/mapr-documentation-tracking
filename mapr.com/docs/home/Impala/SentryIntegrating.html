Integrating Sentry

   Integrate Sentry with other ecosystem components to enable those
   components to use Sentry authorization. You can also integrate Sentry
   with Hue in order to use the Hue Security application to manage Sentry
   privileges and roles.
   Important: MapR supports Sentry with Impala, Hive, Sqoop2, and Hue if
   you buy Impala support and configure Impala to use Sentry.
   You can configure Sentry to provide authorization in the following
   scenarios:
   Sentry Version Sentry Storage Mode    Component Integration
   1.6.0          Database            Impala 2.2.0 and Hive 1.2.1
   1.6.0          Database            Sqoop2
   1.6.0          File-Based          Impala 2.2.0 and Hive 1.2.1
   1.4.0          File-Based          Impala 1.4.1 and Hive 0.13
   Note:
     * When you configure Impala to use Sentry authorization, both Impala
       and Hive must use Sentry for authorization management. Also,
       impersonation cannot be enabled for Hive.
     * For clusters with Hive but not Impala, authorization can be
       implemented using Hiveâ€™s native authorization mechanisms;Sentry is
       not needed.
