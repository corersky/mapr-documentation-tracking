Impala Limitations

What Impala Does Not Provide

   Impala does not replace Hive or other frameworks built on MapReduce for
   long-running batch-oriented queries.

   Impala is not fit as a query layer to support operational/OLTP
   applications (No update/deletes, not optimized for point look-ups).

Known Limitations in Impala

   Impala has the following known limitations:
     * The LOAD DATA statement does not work when the source directory and
       destination table are in different encryption zones.
     * The Impala configuration option, --disk_spill_encryption, is not
       supported to secure sensitive data from being observed or tampered
       with when temporarily stored on disk.
     * Redaction of sensitive data from Impala log files is not supported.
     * You cannot use the lineage information feature to track who has
       accessed data through Impala SQL statements.

   Impala UDFs (user-defined functions) have the following known
   limitations:
     * Impala does not work with UDFs that accept or return composite,
       nested, or types not available in Impala tables.
     * UDFs must produce the same output each time the same argument value
       is passed.
     * UDFs cannot spawn other threads or processes.
     * Prior to Impala 2.5.0, UDFs become undefined when you restart the
       catalog service. You must reload the UDFs.
     * You currently cannot include user-defined table functions in Impala
       queries.
