Additional Impala Configuration Options

   You can modify the env.sh file located in
   /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/ to set certain Impala start up
   options.

Modifying Startup Options

   The env.sh file contains values that the Impala server, statestore, and
   catalog services use during start up. The file also has information
   about resources allocated for Impala. Most of the default values in the
   env.sh file should work effectively, however there are some values that
   you can modify. You can check the current value of all the settings
   through the Impala web interface, available by default at
   http://<impala-node-hostname>:25000/varz.

   You may want to modify the following content in the env.sh file:
     * Statestore address
     * Amount of memory available to Impala
     * Core dump enablement
     * Session and query idle time

   To modify the values, edit the env.sh file and then restart the Impala
   server, Impala statestore, and Impala catalog to implement the changes.

   Example of some file content that you may want to modify:
HIVE_METASTORE_URI=thrift://localhost:9083
  # not needed if /opt/mapr/hive is configured
IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST=127.0.0.1
IMPALA_STATE_STORE_PORT=24000
IMPALA_BACKEND_PORT=22000
IMPALA_LOG_DIR=/opt/mapr/impala/impala-1.1.1/log
export IMPALA_STATE_STORE_ARGS=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_ARGS:- \
-log_dir=${IMPALA_LOG_DIR}} \
-state_store_port=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_PORT}
export IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS=${IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS:- -log_dir=${IMPALA_LOG_DIR} \
-state_store_port=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_PORT} \
-use_statestore
-state_store_host=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST} \
-be_port=${IMPALA_BACKEND_PORT}}
export ENABLE_CORE_DUMPS=false

   The following table contains a list of settings that you can edit in
   /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh with descriptions for how
   to change them:
   Setting Description
   Statestore address

   You can modify this setting to change the statestore IP address or
   hostname.

   Example:

   If a machine with an IP address of 192.168.0.28 is hosting statestore,
   you can change
IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST=127.0.0.1

   to
IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST=192.168.0.28.

   Memory limits

   If you run Impala on nodes that also run MapReduce, both frameworks may
   compete for memory. Configure memory based on your job requirements and
   SLAs to ensure that each framework has enough memory to avoid
   conflicts.

   You can include the mem_limit parameter in IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS to limit
   the amount of memory available to Impala. Use absolute notation, such
   as 500M or 2G, or a percentage of physical memory, such as 50% to
   specify the memory limit. Impala aborts queries that exceeds the
   specified memory limit. Percentage limits are based on the physical
   memory of the machine.

   You can also include the num_threads_per_disk parameter in
   IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS to limit the number of threads that each disk
   processes per impala server daemon. Limiting the number of threads per
   disk can reduce the overall amount of memory consumed.

   Example:
   To limit Impala to 50% of system memory, modify:
export IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS=${IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS:- \
    -log_dir=${IMPALA_LOG_DIR} \
    -state_store_port=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_PORT} \
    -use_statestore -state_store_host=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST} \
    -be_port=${IMPALA_BACKEND_PORT}}

   to
export IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS=${IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS:- \
    -log_dir=${IMPALA_LOG_DIR} \
    -state_store_port=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_PORT} \
    -use_statestore -state_store_host=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST} \
    -be_port=${IMPALA_BACKEND_PORT} \
    -mem_limit=50% \
    -num_threads_per_disk=2}

   Core dump enablement

   Core dump file locations can vary depending on your operating system
   configuration. Other security settings may prevent Impala from writing
   core dumps when you enable this option.
   To enable core dumps, change export ENABLE_CORE_DUMPS=false to export
   ENABLE_CORE_DUMPS=true.
   Session and query idle time
   You can modify the time for which sessions and queries can remain idle
   by adding the following options to env.sh:
--idle_session_timeout
--idle_query_timeout

   Example:
IMPALA_SERVER_ARGS=" \
 -log_dir=${IMPALA_LOG_DIR} \
 -state_store_port=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_PORT} \
 -idle_query_timeout=<value in seconds> \
 -idle_session_timeout=<value in seconds> \
 -use_statestore \
 -state_store_host=${IMPALA_STATE_STORE_HOST} \
 -catalog_service_host=${CATALOG_SERVICE_HOST} \
 -be_port=${IMPALA_BACKEND_PORT}"

   Use background threads to loadand cache metadata

   The following option controls the parallelism of metadata loading
   during start up for the catalogd daemon and makes Impala use background
   threads after start up to load and cache metadata.
--load_catalog_in_background

   The default setting is true.
   Determine how much parallelism Impala devotes to loading metadata in
   background

   The following option controls the parallelism of metadata loading
   during start up for the catalogd daemon and determines how much
   parallelism Impala devotes to loading metadata in the background:
--num_metadata_loading_threads

   The default is 16, but you can increase this value for systems with a
   huge number of databases, tables, or partitions. You can lower this
   value for busy systems that have CPU-constraints due to jobs from other
   components running in the cluster.
   INSERT to create new partition and inherit permissions

   The following option causes Impala INSERT statements to create each new
   partition with the same MapR-FS permissions as its parent directory:
--insert_inherit_permissions

   By default, INSERT statements create directories for new partitions
   using default MapR-FS permissions.

   After you edit /opt/mapr/impala/impala-<version>/conf/env.sh, use the
   following commands to restart the Impala server and services:
     * Issue the following command to restart the Impala server:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalaserver -action restart -nodes <IP addre
ss where impala server is installed>
     * Issue the following command to restart the Impala statestore:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalastore -action restart -nodes <IP addres
s where impala statestore is installed>
     * Issue the following command to restart the Impala catalog:
$ sudo maprcli node services -name impalacatalog -action restart -nodes <IP addr
ess where impala catalog is installed>
