ODBC Client Connections on Mac OS X

   You can use an ODBC client tool to connect to Impala from Mac OS X.
   Install the driver and configure it to pass a SQL query to Impala.
   After you install the driver, see [1]Configure the MapR Impala ODBC
   Driver for Linux and Mac OS X.
   Before you install the driver, verify that your system meets the
   following prerequisites:
     * Mac OS X version 10.8 or later
     * 100 MB of available disk space
     * iODBC 3.52.7 or above

   To install and configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driver, complete the
   following steps:
    1. [2]Download the MapR Impala ODBC Driver.
    2. Install the MapR Impala ODBC Driver on the machine from which you
       connect to the Impala service. The driver supports 32- and 64-bit
       applications. To install the driver:
         a. Double-click to mount the MapRImpalaODBC.dmg disk image.
         b. Double-click MapRImpalaODBC.pkg to run the Installer.
         c. Follow the instructions in the installer to complete the
            installation process.
         d. When the installation completes, click Close.
       MapR Impala ODBC Driver files install in the following locations:
          + /opt/mapr/impalaodbc/ErrorMessages – Error messages files
            directory
          + /opt/mapr/impalaodbc/Setup – Sample configuration files
            directory
          + /opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/universal – Binaries directory
    3. Update the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. The
       DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must include the paths to
       the:
          + Installed ODBC driver manager libraries
          + Installed MapR Impala ODBC Driver for Impala shared libraries
       For example, if the ODBC driver manager libraries are installed in
       /usr/local/lib, then set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to the following:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/opt/mapr/impalaodbc/lib/universal

   Next Step: See [3]Configure the MapR Impala ODBC Driver for Linux and
   Mac OS X.
