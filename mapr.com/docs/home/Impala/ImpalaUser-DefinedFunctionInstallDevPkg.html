Install the Development Package

   Use the appropriate commands for your operating system to install the
   development package.

   To install the development package, complete the following steps:
    1. Install the gcc-c++ compiler and boost-devel using the command
       appropriate for your environment:
$ sudo yum install gcc-c++ cmake boost-devel
$ sudo apt-get install g++ libboost-devel cmake
    2. Install the development package, using the command appropriate for
       your environment:
$ sudo yum install mapr-impala-udf
$ sudo apt-get install mapr-impala-udf
       Warning: Impala is not required for UDF development. You can create
       UDFs on a minimal development system and then deploy the UDFs to a
       machine with Impala.
