Impala-Shell Commands

   You can specify impala-shell options from the command line or in the
   $HOME/.impalarc configuration file. You can define a set of default
   options for your impala-shell environment in the $HOME/.impalarc
   configuration file. For every command line option, there is an
   equivalent setting in the $HOME/.impalarc configuration file. Options
   specified from the impala-shell command line override corresponding
   options in the configuration file.

   The configuration file must contain the header label [impala], followed
   by the options specific to the impala-shell. This is a standard
   convention for configuration files that enables a single file to hold
   configuration options for multiple applications. To specify a different
   file name or path for the configuration file, specify the argument
   --config_file=path_to_config_file from the command line.

Impala-Shell Commands

   After you connect to an instance of impalad from the impala-shell, you
   can issue certain commands from within the shell. Enter a command at
   the prompt or use the â€“q option to pass it as an argument. The
   impala-shell passes most of the commands to impalad as SQL statements.
   Command Description
   alter Changes table schema in an Impala table, or a table shared
   between Impala and Hive.
   compute stats Gathers critical, statistical information about each
   table when you enable join optimizations.
   connect Connects impala-shell to a specific instance of impalad. The
   default port is 21000 unless modified. You can connect to any host in
   your cluster running impalad. If you connect to an instance of impalad
   that was started with an alternate port specified by the --fe_port
   flag, provide the alternate port.
   describe Shows the columns, column data types, and column comments for
   the table specified. DESCRIBE FORMATTED shows additional information,
   such as the MapR-FS data directory, partitions, and internal table
   properties. You can use desc as an abbreviated alternative for
   describe.
   drop Removes a schema object and its associated data files.
   explain Provides the query execution plan and represents a query as a
   series of steps.
   help Provides a list of available commands and options.
   history Maintains an enumerated cross-session command history. The
   history is stored in ~/.impalahistory.
   insert Writes query results to the table specified. Overwrites table
   data or appends data to the existing table content.
   invalidate metadata Updates impalad metadata. Use this command after
   creating, dropping, or altering databases, tables, or partitions in
   Hive.
   profile Displays low-level information about the most recent query.
   Used for performance diagnosis and tuning.
   quit Exits the shell. Include the final semicolon to ensure that the
   shell recognizes the end of the command.
   refresh Refreshes impalad metadata. Issue the REFRESH command to
   refresh metadata after you make database changes, such as adding or
   removing a table.
   select Specifies the data set to complete an action upon. You can send
   the information returned from select to an output, such as the console
   or a file. You can also use it to complete another query element.
   set Manages query options for an impala-shell session. Issue query
   options to Impala using the SET command. Issue SET without arguments to
   see display a current list query options. Use these options for query
   tuning and troubleshooting. SET has been promoted to an SQL statement
   and can be used in client applications through the JDBC and ODBC APIs.
   To modify option values, issue commands with the syntax SET
   option=value. To restore an option to its default, use the UNSET
   command. Some options take Boolean values of true and false. Others
   take numeric arguments, or quoted string values.
   shell Executes commands specified in the operating system shell without
   exiting impala-shell. Use ! as an abbreviation for the shell command.
   show Displays metastore data for schema objects created and accessed
   through Impala and Hive. Use show to gather information about databases
   or tables.
   summary Summarizes the work performed in various stages of a query. It
   provides a high-level view of the information displayed by the EXPLAIN
   command.
   unset Removes user-specified values for a query option and returns the
   option to its default value.
   use Indicates the database against which to run subsequent commands.
   Avoid using fully qualified names when referring to tables in databases
   other than default. Do not use with the -q option.
   version Returns Impala version information.

Impala-Shell Command Line Options

   Specify the command-line options to change how shell commands run when
   you start the impala-shell. These options do not apply to impalad
   configuration.
   Option Configuration File Setting Description
   -B or --delimited write_delimited=true Prints query results in plain
   text format. Specify the delimiter character with the
   --output_delimiter option. Store query results in a file instead of
   printing to the screen with the -B option.
   --print_header print_header=true Prints a header.
   -o filename or --output_file filename output_file=filename Stores all
   query results in the file specified.
   --output_delimiter=delimiter_character output_delimiter=character
   Defaults to tab ('\t'), and specifies the character to use as a
   delimiter between fields when query results are printed in plain text
   format by the -B option.
   -p or --show_profiles show_profiles=true Displays the query execution
   plan. Provides the same output as the EXPLAIN statement with a detailed
   itemization of execution steps, for every query executed by the shell.
   -h or --help N/A Displays help information.
   -i hostname or --impalad=hostname impalad=hostname[:portnum] Connects
   to impalad on the host specified. The default port of 21000 is assumed
   unless you provide another value. If you connect to an instance of
   impalad that was started with an alternate port specified by the
   --fe_port flag, provide that port.
   -q query or --query=query query=query

   Passes a query or shell command from the command line. The shell
   immediately exits after processing the statement. You can use the
   following statements with the command:
     * SELECT
     * CREATE TABLE
     * SHOW TABLES
     * Any other statement recognized in impala-shell

   Fully qualify the names for tables outside the default database. You
   can also issue the -f option to pass a file with a USE statement
   followed by other queries.
   -f query_file or --query_file=query_file query_file=path_to_query_file
   Passes a SQL query from a file. The file must be semicolon (;)
   delimited.
   -k or --kerberos use_kerberos=true Uses Kerberos authentication when
   the shell connects to impalad. If Kerberos is not enabled on the
   impalad instance, an error displays.
   -s kerberos_service_name or --kerberos_service_name=name
   kerberos_service_name=name Instructs theimpala-shell to authenticate to
   a particular impalad service principal. If a kerberos_service_name is
   not specified, impala is used by default. Using this option in
   conjunction with a connection in which Kerberos is not supported
   returns erros.
   -V or --verbose verbose=true Enables verbose output.
   --quiet verbose=false Disables verbose output.
   -v or --version version=true Displays version information.
   -c ignore_query_failure=true Continues on query failure.
   -r or --refresh_after_connect refresh_after_connect=true Refreshes
   Impala metadata upon connection. Equivalent to running the REFRESH
   statement after connecting.
   -d default_db or --database=default_db default_db=default_db Specifies
   the database to use on startup. Equivalent to running the USE statement
   after connecting. If you do not specify a name, a database named
   default is used.
   -ssl ssl=true Enables SSL for impala-shell.Default: ssl=true
   --ca_cert=path_to_certificate ca_cert=path_to_certificate The local
   pathname that points to the third-party CA certificate or a copy of the
   server certificate for self-signed server certificates. If --ca_cert is
   not set, impala-shell enables SSL, but does not validate the server
   certificate. This is useful for connecting to a known-good Impala that
   is only running over SSL, when a copy of the certificate is not
   available (such as when debugging customer installations).
   -l use_ldap=true Enables LDAP authentication.
   -u user=user_name Sets the user. The impala-shell prompts you for the
   password. Per Active Directory, the user is the short username, not the
   full LDAP distinguished name.
   --config_file=path_to_config_file N/A Specifies the path to the file
   that contains the impala-shell configuration settings. The default path
   is$HOME/.impalarc. You can only specify this setting on the command
   line.
   Note:

   The --strict_unicode option no longer exists. To avoid problems with
   Unicode values in impala-shell, define the following setting before
   running impala-shell:
export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
