Enable SSL Encryption Between Hue and Hive

   Hue automatically determines when SSL encryption is enabled in Hive by
   reading the hive-site.xml file.
   Note: Starting from MEP 6.0.0, SSL encryption is enabled by default for
   Hive in a secured cluster. To configure SSL for Hive on a non-secure
   cluster, refer to [1]Hive Encryption.
    1. The following example shows how to correctly configure the
       directory path where the hive-site.xml file is located in the
       hive_conf_dir property in [beeswax] section of the hue.ini file:
[beeswax]
   ...
   # Hive configuration directory, where hive-site.xml is located
   hive_conf_dir=/opt/mapr/hive/hive-2.3/conf
    2. The following examples show how to enable or disable Hue
       verification of service certificates by configuring ssl_cacerts and
       ssl_validate properties in [desktop] section of the hue.ini file:
       Example for enabling certificate verification:
[desktop]
   ...

  # Path to default Certificate Authority certificates. As example: /path/to/cac
ert.pem
  ssl_cacerts=/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore.pem

  # Choose whether Hue should validate certificates received from the server.
  ssl_validate=true
       Example for disabling certificate verification:
[desktop]
   ...

   # Path to default Certificate Authority certificates. As an example: /path/to
/cacert.pem
   # ssl_cacerts=

   # Choose whether Hue should validate certificates received from the server.
   ssl_validate=false
    3. After you change these properties, restart Hue to apply your
       changes:
maprcli node services -name hue -action start -nodes <hostname>
