Disable an Application in the Hue Interface (optional)

   If you want to disable an application (such as Impala), follow these
   steps:
    1. In the [desktop] section of the hue.ini file, uncomment the #
       app_blacklist= statement and insert the name of the app you want to
       disable (impala in this example).
       Note: Do not remove search from the app_blacklist. The Hue UI will
       not work if the search application is enabled.
# Comma-separated list of apps not to load at server startup.
# Note that rdbms is the name used for dbquery.
app_blacklist=spark,zookeeper,search,impala,sqoop,rdbms
       Note: After removing an application from app_blacklist, you must
       update the Hue internal database to create the tables required for
       the application that was enabled:
cd /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>
source ./build/env/bin/activate
hue syncdb --noinput
hue migrate
deactivate
    2. Once all changes are made, restart Hue so the changes will take
       effect.
       Note: You can re-enable a blacklisted application at any time, and
       then restart Hue.
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <ip_address>
