Establish Communication between Hue and ResourceManagers

   If you run YARN applications, integrate Hue with the ResourceManager to
   view the status of applications in the Job Browser.
   Note: If you installed Hue with the MapR Installer, steps 2 is not
   required as it is performed automatically.
    1. Pick the version of MapReduce (MR) you want to use. Set
       hadoop.yarn_clusters.default.submit_to=True and
       hadoop.mapred_clusters.default.submit_to=False to use MRv2. Or vice
       versa to use MRv1. This option is not used in Hue 4.2+, as support
       of MRv1 was dropped in latest versions of Hue.
    2. Set hadoop.yarn_clusters.default.resourcemanager_host and
       hadoop.yarn_clusters.default.resourcemanager_port with RM host and
       RM IPC ports, respectively. This value is only used to set the
       <jobTracker> property in Oozie workflows that Hue generates.
    3. There are 4 other properties in the hadoop.yarn_clusters.default
       section of the hue.ini file that are in fact used by Hue to access
       different RM-related REST APIs:
          + resourcemanager_api_url
          + proxy_api_url
          + history_server_api_url
          + spark_history_server_url
       The above properties are determined by Hue at runtime by capturing
       the output of maprcli -urls <service>. And in the case where Hue is
       not able to get any data from some of these APIs, it reruns the
       maprcli -urls <service> command to get the updated URL for some of
       these services.
    4. In the hadoop section, set webhdfs_url to be the node that runs
       HttpFS.
    5. In the yarn_clusters section within the hadoop section, set the
       submit_to value to True.

YARN Example

[desktop]

        [hadoop]

        # Use WebHdfs/HttpFs as the communication mechanism.
        # This should be the web service root URL.
        # The ip_address corresponds to the node running httpfs.
        webhdfs_url=http://<ip_address>:14000/webhdfs/v1

        [[yarn_clusters]]
        [[[default]]]
        # Enter the host on which you are running the ResourceManager
        resourcemanager_host=localhost

        # The port where the ResourceManager IPC listens on
        resourcemanager_port=8032

        # Whether to submit jobs to this cluster
        submit_to=True

        ...

        [[mapred_clusters]]
        [[[default]]]

        # Whether to submit jobs to this cluster
        submit_to=False
