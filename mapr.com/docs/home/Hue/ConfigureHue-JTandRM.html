Establish Communication between Hue and ResourceManagers

   If you run YARN applications, integrate Hue with the ResourceManager to
   view the status of applications in the Job Browser.
   Note: If you installed Hue with the MapR Installer, steps 2-4 are not
   required as they are performed automatically.
    1. If high availability for the Resource Manager is not configured,
       set the default_jobtracker_host to the ResourceManager host and
       port in the desktop section.
    2. In the hadoop section, set webhdfs_url to be the node that runs
       HttpFS.
    3. In the yarn_clusters section within the hadoop section, set the
       submit_to value to True.
    4. In the mapred_clusters section, set the submit_to value to False.

YARN Example

[desktop]

        ...
        # Set the default JobTracker host to maprfs to enable HA for JobTracker.
        # If there is a standby JobTracker, it will be found automatically.
        # In the event of failover, Hue will submit queries to the standby JobTr
acker.
        default_jobtracker_host=maprfs:///

        ...

        [hadoop]

        # Use WebHdfs/HttpFs as the communication mechanism.
        # This should be the web service root URL.
        # The ip_address corresponds to the node running httpfs.
        webhdfs_url=http://<ip_address>:14000/webhdfs/v1

        [[yarn_clusters]]
        [[[default]]]
        # Enter the host on which you are running the ResourceManager
        resourcemanager_host=localhost

        # The port where the ResourceManager IPC listens on
        resourcemanager_port=8032

        # Whether to submit jobs to this cluster
        submit_to=True

        ...

        [[mapred_clusters]]
        [[[default]]]

        # Whether to submit jobs to this cluster
        submit_to=False
