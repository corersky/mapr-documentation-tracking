Hue and Livy

   The MapR distribution uses Apache Livy primarily to provide integration
   between Hue and Spark.

   Beginning with MEP 4.0.0, Livy is included as its own package in MapR
   MEP repositories. Before MEP 4.0.0, Livy was included as mapr-hue-livy
   and released only as a part of Hue. For more information about Livy,
   see [1]Apache Livy.
   In this documentation set, Livy documentation is included with the Hue
   documentation topics. For example, see:
     * [2]Hue Release Notes
     * [3]Installing Livy
     * [4]Configure Livy
     * [5]Pre-Upgrade Steps for Livy
     * [6]Upgrading Livy
     * [7]Post-Upgrade Steps for Livy
