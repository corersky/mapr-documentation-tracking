Enable SSL Encryption Between Hue and HttpFS

   As of HttpFS 1.0-1504 and Hue 3.7-1505, you can enable SSL encryption
   and mutual-based authentication between Hue and HttpFS on a secure MapR
   cluster that is version 4.0.2 or greater.

   Complete the following steps to enable SSL encryption and mutual-based
   authentication between Hue and HttpFS on a secure cluster:
    1. Configure HttpFS to use SSL or verify that HttpFS is configured to
       use SSL. For details, see [1]SSL Security for HttpFS.
    2. Set the webhdfs_url property in the [hadoop] [[hdfs_clusters]]
       [[[default]]] section of the hue.ini file to contain the correct
       URL for HttpFS with the HTTPS schema and domain of the HttpFS
       server:
[hadoop]
  [[hdfs_clusters]]
    [[[default]]]
      # Use WebHdfs/HttpFs as the communication mechanism.
      # Domain should be the NameNode or HttpFs host.
      # Default port is 14000 for HttpFs.
      webhdfs_url=https://node1.cluster.com:14000/webhdfs/v1
    3. You can enable or disable Hue verification of service certificates
       by configuring ssl_cacerts and ssl_validate properties in the
       [desktop] section of the hue.ini file.
       Example for enabling certificate verification:
[desktop]
   ...

  # Path to default Certificate Authority certificates. As example: /path/to/cac
ert.pem
  ssl_cacerts=/opt/mapr/conf/ssl_truststore.pem

  # Choose whether Hue should validate certificates received from the server.
  ssl_validate=true
       Example for disabling certificate verification:
[desktop]
   ...

  # Path to default Certificate Authority certificates. As example: /path/to/cac
ert.pem
  # ssl_cacerts=

  # Choose whether Hue should validate certificates received from the server.
  ssl_validate=false
    4. [OPTIONAL] Configure mutual authentication between Hue and HttpFS.
       Add the following configuration in the hue.ini file under the
       [hadoop] [[hdfs_clusters]] [[[default]]] section.
          +
mutual_ssl_auth=True
          +
ssl_cert=/path/to/certificate.pem
          +
ssl_key=/path/to/private_key.pem
       Use absolute paths for ssl_cert and ssl_key. Hue does not support
       private keys with a passphrase in this step.
       The changes are summarized in the following example in the hue.ini
       file, which you can use as a template:
[hadoop]
 [[hdfs_clusters]]
  # HA support by using HttpFs
 [[[default]]]
  # Use WebHdfs/HttpFs as the communication mechanism.
  # Domain should be the NameNode or HttpFs host.
  # Default port is 14000 for HttpFs.
  webhdfs_url=https://node1.cluster.com:14000/webhdfs/v1
      ....
  # SSL certificate based authentication
  ssl_cert=/path/to/certificate.pem
  ssl_key=/path/to/private_key.pem
    5. Restart Hue.
maprcli node services -name hue -action start -nodes <ip_address>
    6. To test that SSL encryption is enabled for HttpFS, run the
       following command:
curl -k --cert /path/to/certificate.pem --key /path/to/private_key.pem
"https://node1.cluster.com:14000/webhdfs/v1?op=GETFILESTATUS&user.name=mapr"
