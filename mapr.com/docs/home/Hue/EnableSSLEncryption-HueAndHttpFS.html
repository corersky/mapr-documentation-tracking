Enable SSL Encryption Between Hue and HttpFS

   As of HttpFS 1.0-1504 and Hue 3.7-1505, you can enable SSL encryption
   and mutual-based authentication between Hue and HttpFS on a secure MapR
   cluster that is version 4.0.2 or greater.

   Complete the following steps to enable SSL encryption and mutual-based
   authentication between Hue and HttpFS on a secure cluster:
    1. Configure HttpFS to use SSL or verify that HttpFS is configured to
       use SSL. For details, see [1]SSL Security for HttpFS.
    2. Start Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action start -nodes <node name>
       When you start or restart Hue on a secure cluster, the secure.sh
       script ($HUE_HOME/bin/secure.sh) generates the following files in
       $HUE_HOME:
          + hue_private_keystore.pem
          + keystore.pem
          + keystore.p12
          + cert.pem
       Note: $HUE_HOME should be replaced with the full path manually.
       The secure.sh script runs with a set of default parameters, which
       should not be changed. If generated keystore files already exist in
       that location, the script does not regenerate the files.
    3. Add the following configuration in the hue.ini file under the
       [[hdfs_clusters]] [[[default]]] section. (Use the absolute paths
       for ssl_cert and ssl_key.)
          +
security_enabled=${security_enabled}
          +
mechanism=${mechanism}
          +
ssl=True
          +
mutual_ssl_auth=True
          +
ssl_cert=/opt/mapr/hue/hue-version.no/cert.pem
          +
ssl_key=opt/mapr/hue/hue-version.no/hue_private_keystore.pem
          +
ssl_cert_ca_verify=False
       The changes are summarized in the following example hue.ini file,
       which you can use as a template:
[[hdfs_clusters]]
# HA support by using HttpFs
  [[[default]]]
     ....
      # Change this if your HDFS cluster is Kerberos-secured
      security_enabled=True

      # SSL certificate based authentication
       ssl=True
       ssl_cert=$HUE_HOME/cert.pem
       ssl_key=$HUE_HOME/hue_private_keystore.pem

      # If certificate verified against certificate authority
      ssl_cert_ca_verify=False
    4. Restart Hue.
maprcli node services -name hue -action start -nodes <ip_address>
    5. To test that SSL encryption is enabled for HttpFS, run the
       following command:
curl k cert /opt/mapr/hue/hue<version.no>/cert.pem key /opt/mapr/hue/hue<version
.no>/hue_private_keystore.pem
"https://localhost:14000/webhdfs/v1?op=GETFILESTATUS&user.name=mapr"
