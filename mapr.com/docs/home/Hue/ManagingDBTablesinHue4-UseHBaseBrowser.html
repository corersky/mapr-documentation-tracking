Using the Hbase Browser

   When you open the Hbase Browser, you can view the all the directories
   and MapR Database binary tables available in MapR file system.

   You can use the HBase Browser to create, edit, and search for MapR
   Database binary tables. However, you cannot enable, disable, or drop
   MapR Database binary tables.
   Note: The browser also lists MapR Database JSON tables. However, their
   appearance is not different from that of MapR Database binary tables.
   You cannot edit JSON tables.
