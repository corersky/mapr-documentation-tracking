Step 1: Setting up MapR-DB Binary Table Mapping

   To use the Hue HBase application to access MapR-DB binary tables, you
   need to set the hbase.table.namespace.mappings property.

Table Mapping Naming Conventions

   A table mapping takes the form name:map , where name is the table name
   to redirect and map is the modification made to the name. The value in
   name can be a literal string or contain the * wildcard. When mapping a
   name with a wild card, the mapping is treated as a directory. Requests
   to tables with names that match the wild card are sent to the directory
   in the mapping.

   When mapping a name that is a literal string, you can choose from two
   different behaviors:
     * End the mapping with a slash to indicate that this mapping is to a
       directory. For example, the mapping mytable1:/user/aaa/ sends
       requests for table mytable1 to the full path /user/aaa/mytable1.
     * End the mapping without a slash, which creates an alias and treats
       the mapping as a full path. For example, the mapping
       mytable1:/user/aaa sends requests for table mytable1 to the full
       path /user/aaa.

Example: Map Table Names to MapR-DB

   In the following example, the hbase.table.namespace.mappings property
   is set so that any flat table name, such as mytable, is treated as a
   MapR-DB table in the directory /tables_dir/mytable.
<property>
  <name>hbase.table.namespace.mappings</name>
  <value>*:/tables_dir</value>
</property>

   Once you finish enabling table mapping in the core-site.xml file, start
   (or restart) the HBase thrift server so the changes will take effect.
maprcli node services -name hbasethrift -action start -nodes node001
