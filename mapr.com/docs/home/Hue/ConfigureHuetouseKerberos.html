Configure Hue to use Kerberos

Creating a Kerberos Principal

   Set up the Kerberos principal and keytab file .

Using Kerberos Tickets for Hue

   Using the keytab and principal you created in the previous step,
   complete the following steps:
    1. Extract the Kerberos ticket from the keytab file.
    2. Optionally, enable the Kerberos ticket renewer.

Extracting the Kerberos Ticket from the keytab File

   To extract the ticket from the keytab file, run the following command
   (substitute your host and realm for perfnode181.perf.lab@dev-maprtech):
kinit -k -t /opt/mapr/conf/mapr.keytab -c /tmp/hue_krb5_ccache mapr/perfnode181.
perf.lab@dev-maprtech

   This command extracts the ticket from mapr.keytab and copies it to the
   path to the Kerberos ticket file used by Hue.

Enabling the Kerberos Ticket Renewer

   Kerberos tickets have a default expiration time of 7 days. If you plan
   to use the Hue Kerberos ticket renewer in your cluster, enable this
   functionality by making changes to these two files:
     * kdc.conf (add the max_renewable_life parameter)
     * krb5.conf (add the renew_lifetime parameter)

Modifying the hue.ini File

   In the kerberos section of the hue.ini file, make the following
   changes:
    1. Supply the path to Hue's kerberos keytab file.
    2. Supply the kerberos principal name for Hue.
    3. Supply the path to kinit.
    4. Complete the following steps in the [[yarn_clusters]] [[[default]]]
       section:
          + If you are using a certificate signed by the CA (Certificate
            Authority), set the ssl_cert_ca_verify value to True.
          + If you are using a self-signed certificate or no certificate,
            leave the value set to False.
    5. For Hue with secure Hive: In the beeswax section, make sure that
       the hive_conf_dir property points to a directory containing a valid
       hive-site.xml file (either the original or a synced copy).
    6. For Hue with secure Hive: Provide the fully-qualified domain name
       (FQDN) for the hive_server_host.
       Note: For Hue to work with HiveServer2 with security enabled, you
       must provide the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for the
       hive_server_host. This must match the FQDN of the hue_principal
       property.
    7. Optional: To enable SSL encryption, see [1]Enable SSL Encryption
       Between Hue and Hive.
    8. For Oozie only: Set the oozie_url parameter in the liboozie
       section.
       Note: For Hue to work with Oozie with security enabled, you must
       provide the URL where the Oozie service is running by setting the
       oozie_url parameter in the liboozie section.

   The changes are summarized in the following hue.ini files, which you
   can use as a template:
[desktop]
  [[kerberos]]
    # Path to Hue's Kerberos keytab file
    hue_keytab=/opt/mapr/conf/mapr.keytab

    # Kerberos principal name for Hue
    # hue_principal=mapr/<hostname>@<realm>
    # Substitute your hostname and realm in the example below
    hue_principal=mapr/perfnode181.perf.lab@dev-maprtech

    # Path to kinit
    # Note that the actual path depends on which Linux OS you are using
    kinit_path=/usr/bin/kinit

[beeswax]
  # If Kerberos security is enabled, use fully-qualified domain name
  # (FQDN)
  hive_server_host=<FQDN of Hive Server>
  # Hive configuration directory, where hive-site.xml is located.
  hive_conf_dir=/opt/mapr/hive/hive-<version>/conf
  # Change this if your Hive is secured
  security_enabled=true
  # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
  mechanism=GSSAPI

[impala]
  # Kerberos principal
  impala_principal=mapr/perfnode181.perf.lab@dev-maprtech

[hadoop]
  ...
  [[yarn_clusters]]
    [[[default]]]
      # Enter the host on which you are running the ResourceManager
      ## resourcemanager_host=localhost

      # The port where the ResourceManager IPC listens on
      ## resourcemanager_port=8032

      # Whether to submit jobs to this cluster
      submit_to=true

      # Change this if your YARN cluster is secured
      security_enabled=true

      # URL of the ResourceManager API
      ## resourcemanager_api_url=https://localhost:8090

      # URL of the ProxyServer API
      ## proxy_api_url=https://localhost:8090

      # URL of the HistoryServer API
      history_server_api_url=https://localhost:19890

      # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
      mechanism=GSSAPI

      # In secure mode (HTTPS), if SSL certificates from Resource Manager's
      # Rest Server have to be verified against certificate authority
      ssl_cert_ca_verify=False

[liboozie]
  # The URL where the Oozie service runs on. This is required in order for
  # users to submit jobs.
  oozie_url=http://perfnode181.perf.lab:<oozie_port_number>/oozie

  # Requires FQDN in oozie_url if enabled
  security_enabled=true
  # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
  mechanism=GSSAPI

[hbase]
  # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
  mechanism=GSSAPI

   Note: You need to manually set security_enabled property to true and
   mechanism property to GSSAPI for a Kerberised environment. These
   options are automatically configured only on a MapR-SASL cluster.

Modifying the core-site.xml File

   In the core-site.xml file, provide the shortname for the Kerberos
   principal as shown. In addition, verify that you configured the
   proxyuser during configuration. See [2]Configure Hue for details.
<!-- Hue security configuration -->
<property>
  <name>hue.kerberos.principal.shortname</name>
  <value>mapr</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hadoop.proxyuser.mapr.groups</name>
  <value>*</value> <!-- A group that all users of Hue belong to, or the wildcard
 value "*" -->
</property>
<property>
  <name>hadoop.proxyuser.mapr.hosts</name>
  <value><hue_server_FQDN></value>
</property>

Restarting Warden and Hue

   After you make all the changes to the files listed above, restart
   Warden and Hue so the changes will take effect.
