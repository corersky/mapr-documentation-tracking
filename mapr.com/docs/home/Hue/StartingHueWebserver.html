Starting the Hue Webserver

   After you configure the hue.ini, you need to start the Hue Webserver
   and verify that it has started.
    1. To start/restart the Hue Webserver, run the following command:
          + If Hue is installed on a cluster node (the common use case and
            recommended practice), run the following command to start the
            Hue webserver:
maprcli node services -name hue -action start -nodes <ip_address>
          + If Hue is installed on a cluster node (the common use case and
            recommended practice), run the following command to restart
            the Hue webserver:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <ip_address>
          + If Hue is installed on an edge node (not recommended), run the
            following command to start the Hue webserver:
/opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/bin/hue.sh runcpserver start
    2. To verify that the Hue webserver started, enter: lsof -i:8888
       The output from this command should look similar to this:
COMMAND     PID USER   FD   TYPE   DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
python2.6 27688 mapr    3u  IPv4 69955314      0t0  TCP *:ddi-tcp-1 (LISTEN)
python2.6 27691 mapr    3u  IPv4 69955314      0t0  TCP *:ddi-tcp-1 (LISTEN)
       You can also check Hue webserver logs to verify that Hue webserver
       started. If the Hue webserver was installed on a cluster node, the
       log is found here:
/opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/bin/logs/runcpserver.log
       If the Hue webserver was installed on an edge node, the log is
       found here:
/opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/logs/runcpserver.log
