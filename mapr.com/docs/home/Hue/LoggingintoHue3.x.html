Logging into Hue 3.x

    1. Once Hue is installed and the configuration files have been edited,
       direct your browser to the IP address where you installed Hue:
ip_address>:8888
       The following screen appears:

    2. Sign in with your username, enter the password mapr and click Sign
       in. You can find your username in one of these ways (depending on
       where Hue is installed):

        Cluster node
                If Hue is installed on a cluster node, the Hue admin
                username is contained in the file
                /opt/mapr/conf/daemon.conf

        Edge node
                If Hue is installed on an edge node (not on the cluster),
                the Hue admin username is the user who installed Hue. This
                is the username returned by the logname command.
