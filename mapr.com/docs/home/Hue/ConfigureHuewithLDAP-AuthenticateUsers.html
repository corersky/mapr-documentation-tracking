Authenticating Hue Users with LDAP Credentials

   This section explains how to edit the ldap section of the hue.ini file
   to enable Hue user authentication with LDAP credentials. These
   instructions assume you have completed the steps in [1]Setting up Users
   from an LDAP Database.
   Warning:

   If you switch to authentication through LDAP credentials, the Hue User
   Admin users will lose superuser privileges unless you take one of the
   following actions:
     * Import one or more superuser accounts from LDAP and assign them
       superuser permission.
     * If you have already enabled the LDAP authentication back end, log
       into Hue using the LDAP back end, which will create an LDAP user.
       Next, disable the LDAP authentication back end and use User Admin
       to give the superuser permission to the new LDAP user.

   Before you edit the parameters in the hue.ini file, determine whether
   your LDAP server allows anonymous searches.
     * If anonymous searches are allowed, use the direct bind method.
     * If anonymous searches are not allowed, use bind credentials (also
       known as search and bind).

   The following flow chart shows which parameters you must specify for
   each of these authentication methods:

   These are the parameters you need to set in the ldap section of the
   hue.ini file so you can authenticate Hue users with LDAP credentials:
   Parameter Description Comments
   search_bind_authentication Determines which authentication method to
   use: search and bind, or direct bind.

   When set to true, Hue performs an LDAP search using bind_dn and
   bind_password as provided in hue.ini. The search can be further limited
   by the search filter user_filter.

   When set to false, Hue performs a direct bind to LDAP using the
   credentials provided from one of these sources:
     * the UPN, formed by concatenating <shortname> (the user name
       provided on the Hue login page) and nt_domain (if nt_domain is
       specified)
     * the ldap_username_pattern (if nt_domain is not specified)

   nt_domain

   The NT domain to connect to.

   This parameter is only used with Active Directory.

   Used with the direct bind method of authentication.

   If nt_domain is specified, then ldap_username_pattern is ignored.
   ldap_username_pattern Used to connect to directory services other than
   Active Directory.

   Used with the direct bind method of authentication.

   Usually takes the form "cn=<username>,dc=example,dc=com"
   backend The backend to use for authenticating users. Needs to be set to
   desktop.auth.backend.LdapBackend for Hue authentication.
