Modifying the hue.ini File

    1. Locate the sqoop section of the hue.ini file.
[sqoop]
  # For autocompletion, fill out the librdbms section.

  # Sqoop server URL
  ## server_url=http://localhost:12000/sqoop
    2. Uncomment the ## server_url=http://localhost:12000/sqoop statement
       and change localhost to the IP address or host name of the node
       where the Sqoop2 server is running.
server_url=http://<ip_address>:12000/sqoop

   Warning: In Hue 3.x releases, Sqoop2 only supports files in
   comma-separated value (.csv) format.
