Integrate Hue with Drill

   Starting in MEP 6.0, Drill is officially supported with Hue. When you
   integrate Drill with Hue, users can run Drill queries from the Hue
   interface and visualize data.

   Drill integrates with Hue through configuration options in the
   /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/conf/hue.ini file. A user can authenticate
   to Hue through Plain, Kerberos, or MapR-SASL authentication. The user
   that authenticates to Hue is the user that runs the Drill queries from
   Hue.

   When connecting to Drill, Hue performs outbound impersonation to Drill,
   as the user that authenticated to Hue. Drill accepts the outbound
   impersonation from Hue as an inbound impersonation. Drill then performs
   outbound impersonation to the MapR File System or MapR Database.
   Note: In a secure cluster, you can only access the Hue interface
   through HTTPS.
   Note: SSL encryption is currently not supported.

Prerequisites

   Note the following prerequisites before you integrate Hue with Drill:
     * The cluster must have the latest versions of [1]Hue, [2]Drill, and
       [3]HTTPFS installed. Hue uses HTTPFS to communicate with the MapR
       File System. You can see the latest component versions in the
       [4]Component Versions for Released MEPs. If you install Hue and
       Drill on a secure MapR cluster, Hue and Drill are installed with
       the default MapR security configurations and outbound impersonation
       is enabled.
          + MapR Installer
            When you install Hue and Drill using the MapR Installer,
            HTTPFS is installed automatically, and Hue is automatically
            configured to integrate Drill without having to perform any
            manual configuration. The installer configures a Zookeeper
            connection to Drill in hue.ini, by default.
          + Manual Installation
               o Install HTTPFS and then configure Hue, as described in
                 the following section, Configuring Hue
     * In a secure cluster, Drill must have [5]user impersonation enabled.
          + Drill has an inbound impersonation policy option,
            exec.impersonation.inbound_policies, that allows the Hue
            process user (proxy user) to impersonate the Hue authenticated
            user as an outbound impersonation from Hue to Drill. This
            option is automatically configured when Drill and Hue are
            installed using the MapR Installer with MapR default security
            enabled, or when you run configure.sh on a secure cluster. If
            you do not run configure.sh, you must manually add this option
            to the impersonation configuration in the
            /opt/mapr/drill/drill-<version>/conf/drill-override.conf file,
            as shown:
impersonation.enabled: true,
  impersonation.max_chained_user_hops: 3,
  exec.impersonation.inbound_policies: "[{proxy_principals:{users:[\"mapr\"]},ta
rget_principals:{users:[\"*\"]}}]",

     * If you plan to use Kerberos for authentication, you will need to
       include the Hue keytab file and Kerberos principal name for Hue in
       the hue.ini file. If needed, complete the steps listed in the
       Creating a Kerberos Principal and Extracting the Kerberos Ticket
       from the keytab File sections on the[6]Configuring Hue to Use
       Kerberos page.

Configuring Hue

   If you manually installed Hue, Drill, and HTTPFS, you must modify the
   hue.ini file to include the configuration information needed for Hue to
   connect with Drill and HTTPFS. The hue.ini file contains sections where
   you configure Hue to integrate with various components, like Drill and
   HTTPFS. You can access the hue.ini file in the
   /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/desktop/conf directory. Start/Restart the
   services after you update the hue.ini file.
   Note: If you installed Hue and Drill using the MapR Installer, these
   options are populated automatically in the hue.ini file; no
   configuration is required. In a secure MapR cluster, the authentication
   mechanism defaults to MAPR-SECURITY.
   Complete the following steps to integrate Hue with Drill:
    1. Edit the Drill configuration in hue.ini.
       The hue.ini file contains a [[[drill]]] section under which you can
       see configuration options needed for Hue to connect with Drill. You
       must uncomment an option (remove the # character) in the hue.ini
       file for the option to take effect.
       The following tables list and describe the Drill options with
       possible values and also provide examples:

   CAPTION:

   Options Descriptions Examples
   connection_type=

   Tells Hue how to connect to Drill. Enter one of the following values:
          + direct
          + zookeeper

   A direct connection is a connection in which Hue connects directly to a
   Drillbit. A ZooKeeper connection is a connection in which Hue
   communicates with ZooKeeper and ZooKeeper provides Hue with a Drillbit
   to connect with.
   connection_type=zookeeper
   drillbits= Enter the node IP address of the Drillbit that Hue connects
   with. Only enter a node address if using the “direct” connection_type.

   drillbits=10.10.100.2:31010
   To list multiple Drillbits, separate each IP address by a comma, as
   shown:
   drillbits=[7]10.10.100.2:31010,[8]10.10.100.3:31010

   Note: Port 31010 is the user port between nodes in a Drill cluster.
   This port is needed for an external client to connect into the cluster
   nodes and for the Drill Web Console.
   zk_quorum= Enter the list of ZooKeeper node IP addresses in the
   ZooKeeper quorum. Only enter the IP addresses for the ZooKeeper quorum
   if using the “zookeeper” connection_type. zk_quorum=10.10.100.3:5181,
   10.10.100.4:5181, 10.10.100.5:5181
   zk_cluster_id= Enter the name of the Drill cluster that you want Hue to
   connect to. zk_cluster_id=dev-drillbits
   mechanism=

   The type of authentication enabled. Enter one of the following values:
          + None
          + GSSAPI
          + MAPR-SECURITY

   None is for Plain (username/password) authentication. GSSAPI is for
   Kerberos authentication. MAPR-SECURITY is for maprsasl.
   If you set the mechanism to “none” and impersonation is enabled, you
   must set the username and password to the admin or proxy user that will
   impersonate Hue end users. You can set these with the user= and
   password= options.
   If you set the mechanism to GSSAPI, you must also include the
   ccache_path= option. For this option, enter the caching location for
   Kerberos credentials, for example: ccache_path=/tmp/hue_krb5_ccache

   Note: See [9]Extracting the Kerberos Ticket from the keytab File

   You can set the Drill Kerberos principal and/or Hue impersonation using
   the option named “options=.” See “options=” below.
   mechanism=none
   user=

   If using Plain authentication, enter the username. If using another
   authentication mechanism, do not enter a value.
   Set the username to the admin or proxy user that will impersonate Hue
   end users.
   If impersonation is disabled, the you can set the user to any user. Hue
   will connect to Drill as the user specified.
   user=mapr
   password=

   If using Plain authentication, enter the password. If using another
   authentication mechanism, do not enter a value.
   Set the password for the admin or proxy user that will impersonate Hue
   end users.
   If impersonation is disabled, set the password for the use specified.
   password=mapr8
   password_script=

   Indicates which script to run for the database password when a password
   is required and the password= option is not set. Enter the location of
   the script.
   The following shell script is an example of a password script:
   #!/bin/bash
   case $1 in
   drill) echo "password_1";;
   some-output) echo "password_2";;
   *) echo "wrong argument" >&2 exit 1;;
   esac
   password_script='/root/hue_password_script/password_script.sh drill'
   options=

   Additional options related to impersonation and Kerberos
   authentication. This option takes the following values:
          + impersonation
          + principal

   Impersonation enables or disables outbound impersonation in Hue.
   Principal is the Drill service principal when Kerberos authentication
   is enabled.
   options='{"impersonation": true, "principal": "mapr/localhost@REALM"}'
   options='{"impersonation": true}'
   options='{"impersonation": false}'
    2. Add the HTTPFS URL in hue.ini.
       The hui.ini file contains a [[[default]]] section in the [hadoop]
       block under which you can see HDFS configuration options. You must
       uncomment an option (remove the # character) in the hue.ini file
       for the option to take effect.
       In the [[[default]]] section of the [hadoop] block, enter the IP
       address of the HTTPFS node as the value for the webhdfs_url=
       option, as shown:
# Use WebHdfs/HttpFs as the communication mechanism.
# Domain should be the NameNode or HttpFs host.
# Default port is 14000 for HttpFs.
webhdfs_url=https://<httpfs-node-ip-address>:14000/webhdfs/v1

    3. Start the services.
       Start/Restart Hue, Drill, and HTTPS to apply the updated
       configurations, as shown in the following examples:
maprcli node services -name hue -action start -nodes <hue-node-ip-address>

maprcli node services -name drill-bits -action start -nodes <list-of-drill-node-
ip-addresses>

maprcli node services -name httpfs -action start -nodes <httpfs-node-ip-address>

Run Drill Queries in Hue

   Once you have configured Hue and started the services, you can run
   Drill queries from Hue and visualize your data.
   Complete the following steps to run Drill queries in Hue:
    1. In your web browser, enter the Hue URL to navigate to the Hue web
       interface, as shown:
http://hue-node-ip-address:8888
    2. If prompted, enter your user credentials. The Hue interface opens.
    3. In the Query drop-down, select Editor > Drill. The left navigation
       panel displays the list of schemas available in Drill.
    4. Select a schema, for example dfs.default, and then enter a query in
       the text field.
    5. Click the blue play button to execute the query. Query results
       display.
    6. Optionally, you can use the buttons to the left of the query
       results to visualize the data.
