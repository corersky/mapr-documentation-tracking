Configure PAM Authentication Between Hue and Hive

   In Hue 3.10, you can configure Hue to use PAM authentication when it
   communicates with HiveServer2. Before you configure Hue to use PAM
   authentication with HiveServer2, verify that HiveServer2 is configured
   to use PAM authentication. See [1]Configure HiveServer2 to Use PAM
   Authentication for more information.

   Complete the following steps to configure PAM authentication between
   Hue and Hive:
    1. Configure the [beeswax] section of the hue.ini file. Set the
       mechanism option to none. Set the auth_username and auth_password
       options in the [desktop] or [beeswax] sections of hue.ini (where
       auth_username and auth_password are the user credentials for the
       user who authenticates the Hue service with HiveServer2).
       The following example summarizes these changes:
[desktop]
     ...
     # Default LDAP/PAM/.. username and password of the Hue user used for authen
tication with other services.
     # Inactive if password is empty.
     # e.g. LDAP pass-through authentication for HiveServer2 or Impala.
 Apps can override them individually.
       auth_username=mapr
       auth_password=<user_password>
     ...
 [beeswax]
     ...
     # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
       mechanism=none
    2. Restart Hue:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <Hue node>
