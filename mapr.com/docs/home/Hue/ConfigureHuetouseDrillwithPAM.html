Configure Hue to use Drill on PAM-Secured Cluster

   You can configure Hue to use Drill on a Pluggable Authentication
   Modules (PAM) secured cluster.
    1. Configure Hue to use Drill:
         a. In the hue.ini, go to the Drill section, and set the
            parameters. For example:
[librdbms]
  [[databases]]
    ...
    [[[drill]]]

    # Name to show in the UI.
    nice_name=”Drill”

    # Database backend to use.
    engine=drill

    # Connection type. This can be:
    # 1. direct
    # 2. zookeeper
    connection_type=direct

    # Drillbit address for direct connection.
    drillbits=<node>:31010

    # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY.
    mechanism=none

    # Username to authenticate with when connecting to the database.
    # Used with plain authentication (mechanism set to "none").
    user=<user>

    # Password matching the username to authenticate with when
    # connecting to the database.
    # Used with plain authentication (mechanism set to "none").
    password=<password>
    2. Restart Hue to apply the updated configuration:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <node>
