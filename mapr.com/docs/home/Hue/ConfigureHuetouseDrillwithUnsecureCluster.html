Configure Hue to use Drill on an Unsecured Cluster

   You can configure Hue to use Drill on an unsecure cluster.
    1. Configure Hue to use Drill:
         a. In the hue.ini, go to the Drill section, and set the
            parameters. For example:
[librdbms]
  [[databases]]
    ...
    [[[drill]]]

    # Name to show in the UI.
    nice_name=”Drill”

    # Database backend to use.
    engine=drill

    # Connection type. This can be:
    # 1. direct
    # 2. zookeeper
    connection_type=direct

    # Drillbit address for direct connection.
    drillbits=<node>:31010

    # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY.
    mechanism=none
    2. Restart Hue to apply the updated configuration:
maprcli node services -name hue -action restart -nodes <node>
