Configure Hue

   Hue is the open source UI that interacts with Apache Hadoop and its
   ecosystem components.

   After you install Hue, perform the following steps to configure Hue:
    1. Complete the general configuration steps. This includes integrating
       Hue with ResourceManager and HttpFS.
    2. Perform the steps to integrate each additional component that you
       want to use with Hue.
          + Hive
          + MapR Database
          + Impala
          + Oozie
          + Spark
          + Sqoop2

   You may also want to do the following:
     * Configure Security
     * Configure DB Query
     * Configure Hue Interface Authentication

   Note: The hue.ini file is the main configuration file for running Hue
   on a cluster. This file is located at
   /opt/mapr/hue/hue-<version>/desktop/conf/hue.ini. When you update the
   value of a property in the hue.ini, remove any hashes (##) that appear
   directly before the property name. You must also restart Hue for these
   changes to take effect.
