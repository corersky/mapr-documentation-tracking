Configure Hue to use MapR-SASL

   You can configure Hue to use MapR-SASL for its communications with
   various components on a secure MapR cluster. Hue automatically detects
   and sets the security configuration of the cluster and its components.
   Therefore, in some cases, minimal configuration is required.
   This topic includes instructions to complete the MapR-SASL
   configuration for:
     * Hive
     * Sqoop2
     * HttpFS
     * Oozie
     * YARN

   Note: After you configure the hue.ini, you must restart Hue. However,
   if you configure multiple sections of the same file, you can restart
   Hue one time after your updates are complete.

Configure Hue to use MapR-SASL for Hive

   Hue can use MapR-SASL to communicate with Hive on a secure MapR
   cluster.

   When Hive is configured to use MapR-SASL and the cluster is secure, Hue
   automatically uses MapR-SASL with Hive.

Configure Hue to use MapR-SASL for Sqoop2

   Hue can use MapR-SASL to communicate with Sqoop2 on a secure MapR
   cluster.

   When Sqoop2 is configured to use MapR-SASL and the cluster is secure,
   Hue automatically uses MapR-SASL with Sqoop2.

Configure Hue to use MapR-SASL for HttpFS

   Hue uses MapR-SASL to communicate with HttpFS 1.0 on a secure MapR
   cluster.

   The default hui.ini file that is installed with Hue includes the
   following configurations that allow Hue to automatically detect and set
   the security configuration:
 [[hdfs_clusters]]
        # HA support by using HttpFs
        [[[default]]]
        ...
        # Change this if your HDFS cluster is secured
        security_enabled=${security_enabled}

        # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
        mechanism=${mechanism}
        ...

   Note: If you set security_enabled=True and mechanism=MAPR-SECURITY, Hue
   will use MapR-SASL but you will not take advantage of the automatic
   detection feature.

Configure Hue to use MapR-SASL for Oozie

   Hue can use MapR-SASL to communicate with Oozie on a secure MapR
   cluster.

   The default hui.ini file that is installed with Hue includes the
   following configurations that allow Hue to automatically detect and set
   the security configuration:
[liboozie]
        ...
        # Requires FQDN in oozie_url if enabled
        security_enabled=${security_enabled}
        ...
        # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
        mechanism=${mechanism}

   Note: If you set security_enabled=True and mechanism=MAPR-SECURITY, Hue
   will use MapR-SASL but you will not take advantage of the automatic
   detection feature.

Configure Hue to use MapR-SASL for YARN

   Hue can use MapR-SASL to communicate with YARN on a secure MapR
   cluster.

   To configure Hue to use MapR-SASL for YARN, complete the following
   steps to in the [[yarn_clusters]] [[[default]]] section of the hue.ini:
    1. Verify that security_enabled=true or
       security_enabled=${security_enabled}.
    2. Verify that mechanism=MAPR-SECURITY or mechanism=${mechanism}.
    3. Set ssl_cert_ca_verify=False.
       Note: The changes are summarized in the following hue.ini file:
[[yarn_clusters]] [[[default]]]
            ...
            # Change this if your YARN cluster is secured
            security_enabled=${security_enabled}
            ...
            # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
            mechanism=${mechanism}

            # In secure mode (HTTPS), if SSL certificates from Resource Manager'
s
            # Rest Server have to be verified against certificate
            authority ssl_cert_ca_verify=False
       Note: If you set security_enabled=True and mechanism=MAPR-SECURITY,
       Hue will use MapR-SASL but you will not take advantage of the
       automatic detection feature.
