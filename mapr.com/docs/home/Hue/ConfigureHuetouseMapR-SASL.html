Configure Hue to use MapR-SASL

   You can configure Hue to use MapR-SASL for its communications with
   various components on a secure MapR cluster. Hue automatically detects
   and sets the security configuration of the cluster and its components.
   Therefore, in some cases, minimal configuration is required.
   The following components are supported by Hue with MapR-SASL:
     * HttpFS
     * YARN and Spark History Server
     * Hive
     * Livy
     * Sqoop2
     * HBase Thrift
     * Oozie
     * Drill

   Note: For secure by default clusters or for clusters where the
   customSecurity flag is not added, Hue automatically sets
   security_enabled to true and mechanism to MAPR-SECURITY for these
   components. In all other cases update the ${security_enabled} variable
   manually.
   An example of a default configuration with automatically defined
   security_enabled and mechanism properties for HttpFS is as follows:
[hadoop]
 [[hdfs_clusters]]
   # HA support by using HttpFs
   [[[default]]]
        ...
   # Change this if your HDFS cluster is secured
   security_enabled=${security_enabled}

   # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
   mechanism=${mechanism}
        ...

   An example of a manual configuration of security_enabled and mechanism
   properties for HttpFS is as follows:
[hadoop]
 [[hdfs_clusters]]
   # HA support by using HttpFs
   [[[default]]]
        ...
   # Change this if your HDFS cluster is secured
   security_enabled=true

   # Security mechanism of authentication none/GSSAPI/MAPR-SECURITY
   mechanism=MAPR-SECURITY
        ...

   Note: After you configure the hue.ini, you must restart Hue. However,
   if you configure multiple sections of the same file, you can restart
   Hue one time after your updates are complete.
