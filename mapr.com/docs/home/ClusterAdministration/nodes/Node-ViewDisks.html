Viewing the List of Disks

   You can view the disks on a node using MCS and the CLI.

Viewing the List of Disks Using the MapR Control System

   To view both the system and file system disks:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the [1]node information page.
    2. Go to the Summary tab.
       On this page, the Disks and System Disks panes display the
       following for each disk:

   Column Name Column Description
   Status The status of the disk. Value can be one of the following:
          + [diskStatus-ActiveGood.png] — indicates disk is active or
            good.
          + [diskStatus-Standby.png] — indicates disk is on standby.
          + [diskStatus-Offline.png] — indicates disk is offline.

   Device The disk partition(s).
   Mnt Indicates whether ( [checkMark.png] ) or not the disk is mounted.
   MapR Filesystem (Displayed in the Disks pane only) The disks available
   for MapR Filesystem. A [checkMark.png] indicates that the disk was
   added to MapR Filesystem.
   File System (Displayed in the System Disks pane only) The disks for
   system use.
   Allocated The amount of space allocated, in gigabytes.
   Used The percentage of disk space used.
   Model# The disk model number.
   Firmware Version The disk firmware version.
   Storage Pool The ID of the storage pool associated with the disk.
       Select the checkbox beside a disk in the Disks pane to:
          + [2]Add Disk(s) to MapR Filesystem
          + [3]Remove Disk(s) from MapR Filesystem
       Note: Disks in the System Disks pane cannot be selected.

Retrieving the List of Disks Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to list the disks on a node is:
maprcli disk list -host <host>

   For complete reference information, see [4]disk list.
