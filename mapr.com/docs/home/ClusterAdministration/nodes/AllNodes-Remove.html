Removing one or more Nodes

   Before you start:
    1. Drain the node of data by [1]moving the node to the /decommissioned
       physical topology. All the data on a node in the /decommissioned
       topology is migrated to volumes and nodes in the /data topology.
    2. Run the following command to check if a given volume is present on
       the node:
maprcli dump volumenodes -volumename <volume> -json | grep <ip:port>
       Run this command for each non-local volume in your cluster to
       verify that the node being removed is not storing any volume data.
    3. Install CLDB or ZooKeeper on another node (only) if the node you
       are removing is a CLDB or ZooKeeper node and run configure.sh with
       -C and -Z options.
       This is to ensure that ZooKeeper quorum is maintained and that an
       optimal number of CLDB is available for high availability.

   You can remove one or more nodes using MCS and the CLI.

Removing Multiple Nodes Using the MapR Control System

   To remove one or more nodes:
    1. Log in to MCS and click Nodes.
    2. Select the nodes from the list of nodes in the Nodes pane and click
       Remove Node(s).
       The Remove Node(s) dialog displays.
    3. Verify the list of nodes to remove and click Remove Nodes.

Removing a Node Using the MapR Control System

   To remove a node:
    1. Go to the [3]node information page and click Remove Node.
       The Remove Node(s) confirmation dialog displays.
    2. Click Remove Node.

Removing one or more Nodes Using the CLI or REST API

   Use the [4]node remove command to remove one or more server nodes from
   the cluster. To run this command, you must have full control (fc) or
   administrator (a) permission. The syntax is:
maprcli node remove -nodes <node names> ]

   After you issue the [5]node remove command, wait several minutes to
   ensure that the nodes have been completely removed.

   For complete reference information, see [6]node remove.
