Filtering the List of Nodes

   Describes how to setup search expressions and filter nodes based on
   specific criteria.

   The filter lets you build search expressions to provide sophisticated
   filtering capabilities for locating specific data on views that display
   a large number of nodes. Expressions are implicitly connected by the
   AND operator.

Filtering the Node List in the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and click Nodes to filter the list of nodes in the
       Nodes pane.
    2. Click [filterMenu.png] and select one of the following from the Add
       Filter dropdown menu.
          + Health — to filter the list by node health
          + Hostname — to filter the list by hostname of node
          + Physical IP — to filter the list by IP address of node
          + Last FS Heartbeat — to filter the list by number of heartbeats
            sent to FS
          + CPU Utilized — to filter the list by number of cores utilized
          + Physical Topology — to filter the list by rack path
          + Configured Services — to filter the list by configured
            services
          + Memory Used — to filter the list by amount of memory used
          + Running Services — to filter the list by installed services
          + Used Disk Space — to filter the list by amount of disk space
            used
          + Virtual IP — to filter the list by virtual IP address
    3. Specify the value in the dropdown field for the selected filter (to
       filter the list of nodes by) and click Filter.
       As you make selections and specify the filtering criteria, the pane
       displays only the nodes that match the specified filtering
       criteria.
    4. Click:
          + Add Filter to add another filtering criteria.
          + [removeSelection.png] to remove a filtering criteria.
          + [deleteFilters.png] to clear all filter settings.

Filtering the List Using the CLI

   Use the [1]node list command with the -filter option, to specify large
   numbers of nodes by matching specified values in specified fields
   rather than by typing the name of each node explicitly. For example,
   you can retrieve all nodes on a specific subnet as follows:
maprcli node list -filter [ip==20.30.40.*]

   For more information, see [2]Filters.
