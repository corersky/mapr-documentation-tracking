Viewing the list of Nodes

   You can view the list of nodes in MCS and using the CLI.

Viewing the list of Nodes in the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and click Nodes.
   The page contains the following panes:
   Node Health Displays each node’s health.
   Top Utilization Displays nodes that are consuming the most CPU, memory,
   and disk.
   Active Node Alerts Displays active alerts for nodes in the cluster.
   Nodes Displays all the nodes in the cluster.
   For each node in the cluster, the Nodes pane displays the following:

   CAPTION:

   Column Name Column Description
   Health The health of the node. Value can be:
     * [activeHealth.png] — Healthy

     * [maintenanceHealth.png] — Maintenance

   Hostname The hostname of the node.
   Physical IPs The physical IP address or addresses associated with the

     * [2]Remove Nodes
     * [3]Manage Services

Retrieving the list of Nodes Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to view all the nodes on a cluster is:
maprcli node list -cluster <cluster>
