Balancing Overused and Above Average Bins

   Storage pools in the Overused and Above Average bins are highly
   utilized. The default threshold of “overused” is 90%, which means that
   the first overused bin’s lower bound is 90%. You should not reset this
   threshold, but you can, if necessary, by setting the value for the
   parameter cldb.balancer.disk.overused.threshold using the maprcli
   config save command. For example:
maprcli config save -values {"cldb.balancer.disk.overused.threshold":"95"}

   In scenarios when the cluster average is low, storage pools in Above
   Average bins too might not be highly utilized. In this case, to prevent
   unnecessary balancing activity, disk balancer uses an additional
   criterion to prevent wasted moves: only those storage pools whose
   utilization equals to or is greater than a certain threshold are
   considered for balancing. This threshold is controlled by the
   configurable parameter cldb.balancer.disk.threshold.percentage, whose
   default value is 70%.
   Note: If the threshold of the Overused bin is set below the default
   value of 90%, the balancing threshold specified in the
   cldb.balancer.disk.threshold.percentage parameter is also applicable to
   Overused bins also.
