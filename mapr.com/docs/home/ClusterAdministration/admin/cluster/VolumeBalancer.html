Volume Balancer

   Volume balancer is used to distribute containers of a volume on all the
   storage pools that belong to the volume’s topology. Although the disk
   balancer balances containers across storage pools, sometimes containers
   of a volume may accumulate on a few storage pools. For example:
     * When the storage pools hosting a volume’s containers are not highly
       utilized, the disk balancer might not spread the volume’s
       containers across storage pools.
     * When new storage pools are added to a topology and the storage
       pools on which the current containers reside are not highly
       utilized, although the disk balancer moves containers to new
       storage pools, it is not guaranteed that a specific volume’s
       containers are evenly spread out.

   In cases such as described above, you can trigger the balancing of a
   volume using a maprcli command. Every time a volume gets out of
   balance, you can trigger the volume balancer (using the maprcli
   command) to balance the containers associated with the volume. The
   container moves triggered by disk and volume balancers do not cause
   other volumes to be imbalanced.
   Note: If both disk balancer and volume balancer are triggered at the
   same time, volume balancer activity takes precedence.
