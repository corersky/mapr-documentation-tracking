Enabling and Configuring Disk Balancer

   You can enable/disable disk space balancer and other settings using MCS
   and the CLI.

Enabling and Configuring Disk Balancer Using the MapR Control System

   To enable and configure disk space balancer through MCS:
    1. Log in to MCS and click Admin > Clusters Settings > Balancer.
    2. Move the slider associated with Enabled to enable (Yes) or disable
       (No) disk space balancer and:
          + Proceed to step 3 if you enabled disk space balancer.
          + Skip to step 4 if you disabled disk space balancer.
       To enable disk space balancer from the command-line, see
       [1]Configuring Disk Balancer Execution.
    3. Select one of the presets or specify a custom percentage for
       Threshold and Concurrent Disk Rebalancer settings. You can choose:
          + Disk Balancer Preset:

              Moderate (Default)

                    # Threshold — 70%
                    # Concurrent Disk Rebalancer — 10%

              Rapid

                    # Threshold — 50%
                    # Concurrent Disk Rebalancer — 5%

              Relaxed

                    # Threshold — 90%
                    # Concurrent Disk Rebalancer — 25%

          + Custom, use the slider to set the threshold and concurrent
            disk rebalancer percentages.
       Here:

   Threshold Specifies the minimum utilization threshold for a storage
   pool to become eligible for rebalancing. Default value is 70%.
   Concurrent Disk Rebalancer Specifies the maximum percentage of data
   that can be rebalanced. The cluster will wait until the number of
   rebalancing operations affects less than this percentage of total data
   eligible for rebalancing. The default value is 10%.
    4. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

Enabling and Configuring Disk Balancer Using the CLI

   The disk space balancer checks every storage pool on a regular basis
   and moves containers from a storage pool when that pool's utilization
   meets the following conditions:
     * The storage pool is over 70% full.
     * The storage pool's utilization exceeds the average utilization on
       the cluster by a specified threshold:
          + When the average cluster storage utilization is below 80%, the
            threshold is 10%.
          + When the average cluster storage utilization is below 90% but
            over 80%, the threshold is 3%.
          + When the average cluster storage utilization is below 94% but
            over 90%, the threshold is 2%.

   You can use the [2]config save command to modify disk space balancer
   parameter values.

   Example: # maprcli config save -values
   {"cldb.balancer.disk.max.switches.in.nodes.percentage":"20"}
   The following table lists the disk space balancer configuration
   parameters with their default values and descriptions:

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Value Description
   cldb.disk.balancer.enable 1

   Specifies whether the disk space balancer runs:
     * 0 - Disabled (does not perform any container moves)
     * 1 - Enabled (normal operation)

   By default, the disk balancer is disabled.
   cldb.balancer.disk.threshold.percentage 70 Threshold for moving
   containers out of a given storage pool, expressed as utilization
   percentage. See also: [3]Balancing Overused and Above Average Bins.
   cldb.balancer.disk.max.switches.in.nodes.percentage 10 This can be used
   to throttle the disk balancer. If it is set to 10, the balancer will
   throttle the number of concurrent container moves (minimum 1) to 10% of
   the total nodes in the cluster rounded up. See [4]Configuring
   Throttling.
