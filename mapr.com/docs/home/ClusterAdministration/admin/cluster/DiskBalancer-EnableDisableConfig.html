Configuring Disk Balancer Execution

   Even when the disk balancer is enabled, the disk balancer waits during
   cluster startup to give enough time for the cluster to settle down. The
   default wait time (specified in seconds) is 30 minutes and can be
   changed using the parameter cldb.balancer.startup.interval.sec. After
   every run, the disk balancer pauses for 2 minutes by default. The pause
   time (specified in seconds) can be increased through the parameter
   cldb.balancer.disk.sleep.interval.sec.

   Run the maprcli config save command and set the following parameters to
   configure disk balancer:
   Parameter Default Value Description
   cldb.balancer.startup.interval.sec 1800 seconds Wait time, in seconds,
   for cluster startup.
   cldb.balancer.disk.sleep.interval.sec 120 seconds Interval, in seconds,
   between disk balancer runs.

   For example, to:
     * Increase the wait time to an hour, change the default value of 1800
       seconds to 3600 seconds:
maprcli config save {"cldb.balancer.startup.interval.sec":"3600"}
     * Increase the pause time between disk balancer runs from 2 minutes
       to 5 minutes, change the default value of 120 seconds to 300
       seconds:
maprcli config save {"cldb.balancer.disk.sleep.interval.sec":"300"}
