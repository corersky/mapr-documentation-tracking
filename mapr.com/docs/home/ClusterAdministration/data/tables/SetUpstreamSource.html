Setting Table as Upstream Source for a Replica

   You can set up the current table as the upstream source for a replica
   if the replica was not configured to automatically re-sync with the
   current table.

Setting Up Current Table as Upstream Source for a Replica Using the MapR
Control System

   To set up a table as the upstream source for replicas:
    1. Go to the Replication tab in the [1]table information page.
    2. Select the checkbox beside the replicas that do not have the
       current table configured as upstream source for automatic re-sync.
       Selecting a checkbox next to a replica makes the Actions dropdown
       menu available.
    3. Select Set Current Table as Upstream Source from the Actions
       dropdown menu.
       The Set Current Table as Upstream Source dialog displays.
    4. Review the list of selected replicas and click Set Upstream Source.
       The current table will automatically send updates to the
       replica(s).
