Resuming Table Replication

   You can resume replication between a source MapR Database binary or
   JSON table and a replica of that table when the replication state is
   set to paused from MCS or by the maprcli table replica add or the
   maprcli table replica pause command.

Resuming Replication Using MCS

    1. Go to the table information page.
       See [1]Viewing Table Information.
    2. Click Replicas to go to that tab.
    3. Select the replicas in paused state by clicking the associated
       checkbox.
       Selecting the checkbox next to a replica makes the Actions dropdown
       menu available.
    4. Select Resume Replication from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Resume Replication confirmation window displays.
    5. Verify the list of replicas to resume replicationg for and click
       Resume Replication.
       If necessary, click [removeSelection.png] to leave the replica in
       paused state.

Resuming Replication Using the CLI or REST API

   The resume replication, run the following command:
maprcli table replica resume -path <table path> -replica <replica table path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce and writeAce on both the source volume and the target
       volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the paths of both tables
     * readperm and replperm permissions on the source table

   For complete reference, see [2]table replica resume.
