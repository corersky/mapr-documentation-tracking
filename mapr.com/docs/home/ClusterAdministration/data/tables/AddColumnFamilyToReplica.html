Adding a Column Family to a Replica

   Changes to the structure of a source table are not automatically
   replicated to replica table. You must complete the following steps to
   add a column family to a replica.

   When an entire table is being replicated, new column families are not
   automatically created at the replica. However, once you add the new
   column family to the replica then updates to the new column family will
   immediately start being replicated.

   When you are replicating a subset of column families and columns, you
   must add the new column family to the replica and also run the
   copytable utility to initially populate the new column family in the
   replica table.
    1. Pause replication by running the [1]maprcli table replica pause
       command.
    2. Add the new column family to the replica by running the [2]maprcli
       table replica edit command.
    3. If the replica includes a subset of column families and columns
       from the source table, copy the data from the new column family
       from the source table into the replica by using the [3]CopyTable
       utility. Use the -columns parameter to specify the name of the
       column family.
    4. Resume replication by running the [4]maprcli table replica resume
       command.
