       Name          The name of the volume.
       Type The type. Value can be:
          + [volPath.png] — Volume
          + [dirPath.png] — Directory
          + [tablePath.png] — Table

       Owner         The name of the owner.
       Last Modified The last modification date and timestamp.
    2. Click on the name of the volume (to browse to the path to the
       table) or enter the name of the volume in the text field.
       The tables in the selected volume display. If necessary, click the
       name of the directory to browse further or [homeView.png] to return

Listing the Tables in a Directory From the Command-line

Method for Binary Tables Only (HBase Shell)

   After starting the HBase shell, run the list command. Include the
   directory path in the command if you want to list tables that are not
   in your home directory. Type help to see a list of commands and their
   syntax.

Method for JSON Tables Only (mapr dbshell)

   After starting the shell, run the list command. Include the directory
   path in the command if you want to list tables that are not in your
   home directory. See [1]MapR Database Shell (JSON Tables).

Retrieving a Table by Table Path Using the CLI or the REST API

   To retrieve table details for a table by specifying the table path from
   the CLI, run the following command:
maprcli table info -path <table-path>

   For information on this command, see [2]table info.
