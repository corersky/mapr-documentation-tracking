Creating a New Table

   There are several methods that you can use to create MapR Database
   tables including the maprcli, and hbase shell, mapr dbshell commands,
   and through the MCS. There are two methods that you can use to create
   both binary tables and JSON tables:
     * MCS
     * CLI

Creating a New Table Using MCS

   To create a new table from the MCS, under Data > Tables:
    1. Click Create Table.
       The Create New Table page displays.
    2. Choose the table type:
          + JSON — see [1]MapR Database as a Document Database
          + Binary — see [2]MapR Database as a Wide-Column Database
    3. Specify the following properties under PROPERTIES.
         a. Enter path to the table in the Table Path field.
            Tables are stored in the MapR file system. When providing the
            path to a table, use these conventions.
               o For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the
                 volume mount point. For example, for a table named test
                 under a volume with a mount point at /volume1, specify
                 the following path: /volume1/test
               o For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the
                 cluster name in the path. For example, for a table named
                 customer in volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify
                 the following path: /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer
         b. Select the interval of time to apply when logging table
            metrics.
            You can choose to log metrics every 10 seconds, 1 minute
            (default), or 10 minutes. For visualizing the metrics, see
            [3]Visualizing Table Metrics in the MapR Control System.
         c. Enable (Yes) or disable (No) auto-splitting of table.
            If enabled, the table will be split automatically into regions
            as the table grows. If disabled, the table can be split
            manually into regions. By default, this is enabled.
         d. Enable (Yes) or disable (No) full bulk load of the table.
            For more information, see [4]Loading Documents into JSON
            Tables. By default, this is disabled.
         e. Enable (Yes) or disable (No) auditing of table operations.
            If auditing is enabled at the cluster and volume levels,
            enabling auditing will cause auditing to start for the table
            operations. For more information, see [5]Auditing of
            Operations on MapR Database Binary Tables and JSON Tables.
    4. Specify users, groups, and/or roles that have and/or do not have
       the following types of access to the table under USER ACCESS
       CONTROLS.
          + [6]JSON Table
          + [7]Binary Table

   CAPTION:

   Administration Can view and edit the permissions for the table.
   Force Pack Can pack table regions.
   Split Merge Can take the following actions:
          + Split the table into regions or merge regions of the table
            together.
          + Change the size of the region.

   Index Can create index for this table.
   Bulkload Can load this table with bulk loads if the table was created
   with bulk load support.
   Replication Access Can set up replication either to or from a table.
   Create/Rename Column Family Can create column families for this table
   or rename existing column families.
   Delete Column Family Can delete column families associated with the
   table.

       By default, all permissions are given to the user creating the
       table.
       To grant or block access to users, groups, and/or roles, from the:
          + Basic settings, select the type — public, (OR) user, group, or
            role — from the drop-down menu, specify the name of the user,
            group, or role, and select one or more checkbox to grant
            permissions.
            Tip: Click [cloneACE.png] to create a copy of the associated
            access control setting. Click [deleteRow.png] to remove the
            associated access control expression.
            To add access control expressions for another user, group, or
            role, click Add Another and repeat this step.
          + Advanced settings, or specify public (p) or user (u), group
            (g), and/or role (r) who have and/or do not have the type of
            access using the following boolean expressions and
            subexpressions:
               o ! — Negation operator.
               o & — AND operation.
               o | — OR operation.
            Use (), parentheses, for subexpressions.
            Note: You cannot specify user, group, or role individually if
            access is granted to all users (public).
            Alternatively, click [editPencil.png] associated with the type
            of access to use the Access Control Expression window to
            define access for public or users, group, and/or role. See
            [8]Defining ACEs for more information.
       Note: If you switch from Basic to Advanced, the basic settings, if
       any, will be carried over to the advanced settings. If you switch
       from Advanced to Basic, all the settings will be lost because the
       subexpressions and AND (&) and negation (!) operations that are
       supported by advanced settings are not supported in the basic
       settings.
       You can proceed to:
          + Step 5 to set default column family permissions.
          + Step 6 to create the table.
    5. Click Default Column Family Authorization.
       You can set up default permissions for column families on this
       page.
          + [9]JSON Table
          + [10]Binary Table
       Specify public, (OR) users, groups, and/or roles that have and/or
       do not have the following types of access to the column families
       under USER ACCESS CONTROLS.

   CAPTION:

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Traverse Data Can pass over fields in JSON documents. For example,
   suppose that a JSON table contains documents of this general structure:
{
  "_id" : "ID",
  "a" :
     {
       "b" : "value",
       "c" : "value"
     }
}

   Suppose further that the user sjohnson has read permission on a.b, but
   not on a. For sjohnson to read a.b, the user needs the traverse
   permission on a. The user can then pass over field a to a.b. This
   permission is inherited by fields within the column family.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.
       Specify public, (OR) users, groups, and/or roles that have and/or
       do not have the following types of access to the column families
       under USER ACCESS CONTROLS.

   CAPTION:

   Read Data Can do column reads. Reads require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Write Data Can do column writes. Writes require permission both at the
   column-family level and at the field level. This permission is
   inherited by fields within the column family.
   Append Data Can do column appends. Column appends require permission
   both at the column-family level and at the column level.
   Set Version Can set or change the maximum and minimum number of
   versions of column values to keep.
   Set Compression Can set or change the compression setting for the
   column family.
       By default, all permissions are given to the user creating the
       table.

    6. Click Create Table to create the table.
       You can proceed to:
          + [12]Add column families to the table.
          + [13]View the table information for the newly created table.

Creating a Table Using the CLI or the REST API

   The basic command to create a binary table is:
maprcli table create -path <path>

   To create a JSON table, include the -tabletype parameter and set it to
   json:
maprcli table create -path <path> -tabletype json

   The -tabletype parameter is set to binary by default.

   The format of the value of the -path parameter depends on whether you
   are creating a table on a local cluster or a remote cluster:
     * For a path on the local cluster, start the path at the volume mount
       point. For example, for a table named test under a volume with a
       mount point at /volume1, specify the following path: /volume1/test
     * For a path on a remote cluster, you must also specify the cluster
       name in the path. For example, for a table named customer under
       volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify the following
       path:/mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customer

   When you create a table with this command, you can set a number of
   properties. See [14]table create.

Creating Tables Using shell Command

     * [15]JSON Tables
     * [16]Binary Tables

   The MapR Database shell command is used on JSON tables only. To run
   this command, execute the following:
mapr dbshell

   After starting the shell, run the create command. See [17]MapR Database
   Shell (JSON Tables).

   The HBase shell command is used on binary tables only. To run this
   command, execute the following:
hbase shell

   After starting the HBase shell, run the create command. Type help to
   see a list of commands and their syntax. See [18]MapR Database HBase
   Shell (Binary Tables).
