Modifying Table Replica

   You can edit the properties of a replica using MCS and the CLI.

Modifying a Table Replica Using MCS

   To modify the properties of a table replica:
    1. Go to the table information page.
       See [1]Viewing Table Information.
    2. Click Replicas to go to that tab.
    3. Click [editPencil-Blue.png] associated with the replica to modify.
       The Edit Replica page displays.
    4. Make changes to the following as desired:

   Path to Replica

   The path to the replica.
          + For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
            mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under a
            volume with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following
            path: /volume1/testdst
          + For a table on another cluster, you must also specify the
            cluster name in the path. For example, for a table named
            customerdst under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify
            the following path: /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   Note: For replication to a table, the command will fail if the replica
   path you specify points to a table that already exists.
   Replication State Specify whether or not to start replication by
   choosing one of the following:
          + Automatic Setup — Creates the table on the destination
            cluster, registers the table on the destination cluster as a
            replica, adds the current table as an upstream source, copies
            the content of the current table into the replica, and start
            replication.
          + Pause Replication — Creates the table on the destination
            cluster, registers the table on the destination cluster as a
            replica, adds the current table as an upstream source, but
            prevents replication from immediately starting after. Pausing
            replica like this allows you to load the data into the replica
            from the current table, after which you can restart
            replication.

   Multi-Master Setup (Available only with Automatic Setup) Multi-master
   topology, in which there are two master-slave relationships, with each
   table playing both the role of a master and a slave. Client
   applications update both tables and each table replicates updates to
   the other.

   See [2]Master-slave replication.
   If this is not selected, table replication will be basic master-slave
   topology, which is the default. In this topology, you replicate one way
   from source tables to replicas. The replicas can be in a remote cluster
   or in the cluster where the source tables are located.

   See [3]Master-slave replication.
   Note: Access control expressions on the replica that control
   permissions for updates to column families and columns are irrelevant
   because all updates from a source table arrive at a replica after
   having been authenticated at a gateway, which has the implicit
   authority to update replicas.
    5. Set the following optional properties:

   CAPTION:

   Throttle Specify whether (Yes) or not (No) to throttle replication
   operations. Throttle the replication stream to minimize the impact of
   the replication process on incoming operations during periods of heavy
   load.
   Replicate Synchronously Specify whether replication is synchronous
   (Yes) or asynchronous (No).
   Encrypt On Wire Specify whether (Yes) or not (No) to enable on-wire
   encryption. If you enable this, the local cluster and any other cluster
   that is part of the replication process must be enabled for security.
   Compress On Wire The type of on-wire compression. Choose one of the
   following:
          + Inherited
          + OFF
          + LZF
          + LZ4
          + ZLib

    6. Choose whether to:
          + For JSON table replica:
               o Replicate Entire Document
               o Replicate Selected Field Paths — Specify the full path to
                 the field in dotted notation. For example, suppose the
                 table contained JSON documents that were of this general
                 structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}
                 To replicate field c, you must specify a.b.c as the field
                 path. Do not use quotation marks and do not include
                 spaces after each dot. Click:
                    # Add Field to add another field to replicate.
                    # [deleteRow.png] to remove a field.
          + For Binary table replica:
               o Replicate All Column Families
               o Replicate Selected Column Families — Specify the column
                 family name and select:
                    # Include All Columns — to replicate all columns
                      associated with the column family.
                    # Assign Columns — to specify specific columns
                      associated with the column family. To add more
                      columns, click +.
    7. Click Edit Replica for the changes to take effect.

Modifying a Table Replica Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to modify a table replica is:
maprcli table replica edit -path <table path> -replica <replica table path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce and writeAce on both the source volume and the target
       volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the paths of both tables
     * readperm and replperm permissions on the source table

   For complete reference, see [4]table replica edit.
