Adding JSON Table Replicas

   You can register a MapR-DB JSON table as a replica of another MapR-DB
   JSON table using MCS and CLI. When you add a replica using the MCS, you
   can also setup and start replication between a source MapR-DB JSON
   table to a replica MapR-DB JSON table. Before you begin, complete the
   steps to [1]prepare MapR clusters for table replication.

Adding JSON Table Replica Using the MapR Control System

   To create a replica:
    1. Go to the table information page.
       See [2]Viewing Table Information.
    2. Click Replicas tab.
       The list of replicas associated with the table displays.
    3. Click Add Replica.
       The Add Replica page displays.
    4. Specify the following settings:

   Destination Cluster The destination cluster for the replica, where
   gateways are configured to allow source cluster to send updates.
   Path to Replica

   The path to the replica.
          + For a table on the local cluster, start the path at the volume
            mount point. For example, for a table named testdst under a
            volume with a mount point at /volume1, specify the following
            path: /volume1/testdst
          + For a table on another cluster, you must also specify the
            cluster name in the path. For example, for a table named
            customerdst under volume1 in the sanfrancisco cluster, specify
            the following path: /mapr/sanfrancisco/volume1/customerdst

   Note: For replication to a table, the command will fail if the replica
   path you specify points to table that already exists.
   Replication State Specify whether or not to start replication by
   choosing one of the following:
          + Automatic Setup — Creates the table on the destination
            cluster, registers the table on the destination cluster as a
            replica, adds the current table as an upstream source, copies
            the content of the current table into the replica, and starts
            replication.
          + Pause Replication — Creates the table on the destination
            cluster, registers the table on the destination cluster as a
            replica, adds the current table as an upstream source, but
            prevents replication from immediately starting after. Pausing
            replica like this allows you to load the data into the replica
            from the current table, after which you can restart
            replication.
            Note: Although visible, this option is not supported if the
            source or replica is on a remote secure cluster.

   Multi-Master Setup (Available only with Automatic Setup) Multi-master
   topology, in which there are two master-slave relationships, with each
   table playing both the role of a master and a slave. Client
   applications update both tables and each table replicates updates to
   the other.

   See [3]Multi-Master replication.
   If this is not selected, table replication will be basic master-slave
   topology. In this topology, you replicate one way from source tables to
   replicas. The replicas can be in a remote cluster or in the cluster
   where the source tables are located.

   See [4]Master-slave replication.
   Note: Access control expressions on the replica that control
   permissions for updates to column families and columns are irrelevant
   because all updates from a source table arrive at a replica after
   having been authenticated at a gateway, which has the implicit
   authority to update replicas.
    5. Set the following optional properties:

   Throttle Specify whether (Yes) or not (No) to throttle replication
   operations. Throttle the replication stream to minimize the impact of
   the replication process on incoming operations during periods of heavy
   load.
   Replicate Synchronously Specify whether replication is synchronous
   (Yes) or asynchronous (No). See [5]Modes of replication for more
   information.
   Encrypt On Wire Specify whether (Yes) or not (No) to enable on-wire
   encryption. If you enable this, the local cluster and any other cluster
   that is part of the replication process must be enabled for security.
   Compress On Wire The type of on-wire compression. Choose one of the
   following:
          + Inherited
          + OFF
          + LZF
          + LZ4
          + ZLib

    6. Choose whether to:
          + Replicate Entire Document
          + Replicate Selected Field Paths — Specify the full path to the
            field in dotted notation. For example, suppose the table
            contained JSON documents that were of this general structure:
{
     "_id" : "ID",
     "a" :
          {
               "b" :
                    {
                         "c" : "value",
                    },
               "e" : "value"
          }
}
            To replicate field c, you must specify a.b.c as the field
            path. Do not use quotation marks and do not include spaces
            after each dot. Click:
               o Add Field to add another field to replicate.
               o [deleteRow.png] to remove a field.
       By default, the entire document in the source table is replicated.
       Note: If a field is added at a later date, replication for that
       field will start at that time.
    7. Click Add Replica.
       A table with the specified fields is created in the destination
       cluster, the new table is declared to be a replica of the source
       table, and the source table is registered as an upstream source for
       the replica.

Adding JSON Table Replica Using the CLI or the REST API

   To add a replica, run the following command:
maprcli table replica add -path <table path> -replica <replica table path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * readAce and writeAce on both the source volume and the target
       volume
     * lookupdir on directories in the paths of both tables
     * readperm and replperm permissions on the source table

   For complete reference information, see [6]table replica add.
   Note: You also have the option to use maprcli table replica autosetup
   which will setup and start replication. For more information, see
   [7]table replica autosetup.
