   (known as spills) into a single spill file.

   All Tables Full Compactions Number of full compactions. Compactions
   combine multiple MapR-DB data files containing sorted data (known as
   spills) into a single spill file. Full compactions improve read
   performance because after compaction, MapR-DB needs to read only the
   single resulting sorted spill file. But they incur I/O costs because
   the compaction must read, sort, and rewrite all data in the spill
   files.
   All Tables Mini Compactions Number of partial compactions. Compactions
   combine multiple MapR-DB data files containing sorted data (known as
   spills) into a single spill file. After a mini compaction, MapR-DB
   needs to read only two spill files.
   All Tables TTL Compactions Number of compactions that result in
   reclamation of disk space after removal of stale data. You can control
   the frequency of TTL compactions by configuring the TTL for a table's
   column families.
   Memindex Usage All Tables Free Index Memory The number of available MB
   in the in-memory bucket file cache.

   ^* Percentiles are estimated by linearly interpolating between fixed
   buckets sizes.
