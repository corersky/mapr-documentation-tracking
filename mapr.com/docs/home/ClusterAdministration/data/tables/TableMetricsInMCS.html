   All Tables Full Compactions Number of full compactions. Compactions
   combine multiple MapR Database data files containing sorted data (known
   as spills) into a single spill file. Full compactions improve read
   performance because after compaction, MapR Database needs to read only
   the single resulting sorted spill file. But they incur I/O costs
   because the compaction must read, sort, and rewrite all data in the
   spill files.
   All Tables Mini Compactions Number of partial compactions. Compactions
   combine multiple MapR Database data files containing sorted data (known
   as spills) into a single spill file. After a mini compaction, MapR
   Database needs to read only two spill files.
   All Tables TTL Compactions Number of compactions that result in
   reclamation of disk space after removal of stale data. You can control
   the frequency of TTL compactions by configuring the TTL for a table's
   column families.

   in the in-memory bucket file cache.

   ^* Percentiles are estimated by linearly interpolating between fixed
   buckets sizes.
