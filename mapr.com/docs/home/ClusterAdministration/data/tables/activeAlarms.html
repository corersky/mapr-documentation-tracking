Viewing Active Table Replication Alarms

   You can view table replication alarms using MCS, the log files, and the
   CLI.

Viewing Active Table Alarms in the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and click Data > Tables to view table replication alarms
   in the Active Alarms pane.
   You can:
     * [1]View information related to the alarm.
     * [2]Dismiss an alarm.
     * [3]Mute an alarm.

   See [4]Table-Replication Alarms for more information on the table
   alarms.

Retrieving Active Table Replication Alarms Using the CLI or REST API

   Alarms for replication are issued per volume rather than per source
   table. To retrieve table replication alarms, run the following command:
maprcli alarm list -cluster <cluster name> -type volume

   For complete reference information, see [5]alarm list.

Viewing Table Replication Alarms in the Log Files

   The log files mfs.log-5 and cldb.log display these alarms. These files
   are located in the /opt/mapr/logs directory.
