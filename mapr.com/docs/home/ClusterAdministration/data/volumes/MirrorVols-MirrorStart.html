Starting the Mirror

   You can start mirroring through MCS and using the CLI.

   When a mirror starts, all the data in the source volume is copied into
   the mirror volume. Starting a mirroring operation requires the mirror
   volume to exist and be associated with a source. After you start a
   mirror, synchronize it with the source volume regularly to keep the
   mirror current.
   Note: The getIPTypeForCluster method in CLDBRpcCommonUtils is unable to
   determine whether the IP type is internal or external, if
   mapr-clusters.conf contains both internal and external IPs. The fix is
   to only put in the internal IP in mapr-clusters.conf and keep the
   external IP in the env.sh file, before starting the mirror.

Starting the Mirror for Multiple Mirror Volumes Using the MapR Control System

   To start mirroring, in the Summary tab under Data > Volumes:
    1. Select the mirror volume(s) to synchronize.
       You cannot start mirror for:
          + Standard volumes
          + Mirror volumes currently mirroring
    2. Select Start Mirroring from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Start Mirroring Volume(s) confirmation dialog displays.
    3. Verify the list of volumes to synchronize and click Start
       Mirroring.
       When a mirror is started, the mirror volume is synchronized from a
       hidden internal snapshot so that the mirroring process is not
       affected by any concurrent changes to the source volume. The
       changes to the mirror volume occur atomically at the end of the
       mirroring process; deltas transmitted from the source volume do not
       appear until mirroring is complete.

Starting the Mirror for a Mirror Volume Using the MapR Control System

   To start mirroring:
    1. Go to the [1]volume information page for the mirror volume to
       synchronize.
    2. Select Start Mirroring from the Select Action dropdown menu.
       The Start Mirroring Volume confirmation dialog displays.
    3. Click Start Mirroring.

Starting the Mirror Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to start a mirror is:
maprcli volume mirror start -name <volume name>
