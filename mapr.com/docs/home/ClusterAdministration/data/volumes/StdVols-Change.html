Changing a Standard Volume to a Mirror Volume

   You can convert a standard volume to a mirror volume and set it up to
   mirror one of its associated mirror volumes.

Changing a Standard Volume to a Mirror Volume Using MCS

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the [1]volume information page for the
       standard volume.
    2. Select Make Mirror Volumes from the Select Action dropdown menu.
       The Mirror Volume confirmation dialog displays.
    3. Select the:
          + Name of the source cluster where the associated mirror volume,
            which the converted volume will mirror, exists.
          + Name of the source volume, which the converted volume will
            mirror, from the list of associated mirror volumes.
       The standard volume, when converted, can only be a mirror of one of
       its associated mirror volumes.
    4. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

   After converting the standard volume to a mirror volume:
    1. Convert the source (mirror) volume to a standard (read/write)
       volume to prevent a deadlock and to allow writes to continue on the
       volume.
    2. Associate a mirroring schedule with this volume to ensure that data
       on this volume is in sync with the source volume.

Changing a Standard Volume to a Mirror Volume Using the CLI or REST API

   To convert a standard volume to a mirror volume from the CLI, run the
   maprcli volume modify command with the -type option value set to
   mirror.
maprcli volume modify -name <volume name> -type mirror

   For more information, see [2]volume modify. After converting the
   standard volume to a mirror volume:
    1. Convert the source (mirror) volume to a standard (read/write)
       volume to prevent a deadlock and to allow writes to continue on the
       volume.
    2. Associate a mirroring schedule with this volume to ensure that data
       on this volume is in sync with the source volume.
