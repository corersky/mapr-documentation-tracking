Viewing Volume Details

   You can retrieve and view volume information using MCS and the CLI.

Viewing Volume Details in the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Summary tab in the [1]volume information
   page for the volume.
   You can view the following in the Details pane on this page.
     * [2]Standard Volume
     * [3]Mirror Volume

   Under this tab... This section... Displays...
   Properties SETTINGS Volume creator username, accountable entity, name,
   type, mount path, topology, access, whether volume is mounted, whether
   volume is partially out of topology, date when volume was last
   accessed, and whether wire-level encryption is enabled for the volume.
   AUDITING Whether auditing is enabled for the volume and the coalesce
   interval.
   REPLICATION The type of replication, the desired and minimum number of
   copies for the volume and the named container, and whether minimum
   number of copies is enforced.
   Authorization ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS The users and/or groups who:
     * Have admin access and/or full control on the volume.
     * Can perform one or more administrative operations such as create a
       dump file and backup the volume, restore and mirror the volume,
       edit the volume properties, and delete the volume.

   USER ACCESS CONTROLS The type of users — public, user, group, and/or
   role — that have and do not have access to volume data.
   Usage Quota The amount of (advisory and hard) disk space allocated to
   the volume.
   Graph The graphs show:
     * DISKUSAGE: The total amount of disk space allocated for the volume
       and the amount of disk space used by the volume and associated
       snapshots.
     * CLUSTER DISKSPACE: The total amount of disk space on the cluster,
       the amount of disk space allocated and utilized by the volumes in
       the cluster, and the reserve limit.

   Schedule Snapshot Schedule The schedule for creating a snapshot of the
   volume for the purpose of preserving the state of the volume.
   Under this tab... This section... Displays...
   Properties SETTINGS User who created the volume and the accountable
   entity responsible for this volume, volume name, names of source volume
   and cluster, type, access type, mount path, and topology.
   AUDITING Whether auditing is enabled for the volume and the coalesce
   interval.
   REPLICATION The type of replication and the desired and minimum number
   of copies for the volume and the named container.
   Authorization ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS The users and/or groups who:
     * Have admin access and/or full control on the volume.
     * Can perform one or more administrative operations such as create a
       dump file and backup the volume, restore and mirror the volume,
       edit the volume properties, and delete the volume.

   USER ACCESS CONTROLS The type of users — public, user, group, and/or
   role — that have and do not have access to volume data.
   Usage Quota The amount of (advisory and hard) disk space allocated to
   the volume.
   Graph The graphs show:
     * DISKUSAGE: The total amount of disk space allocated for the volume
       and the amount of disk space used by the volume and associated
       snapshots.
     * CLUSTER DISKSPACE: The total amount of disk space on the cluster,
       the amount of disk space allocated and utilized by the volumes in
       the cluster, and the reserve limit.

   Schedule Snapshot Schedule The schedule for creating a snapshot of the
   volume for the purpose of preserving the state of the volume.
   Mirror Schedule The schedule for copying data (that has changed at the
   file-block level since the last data transfer) directly from the volume
   to the mirror volume.

Viewing Volume Information Using the CLI or the REST API

   The basic command to retrieve volume information is:
maprcli volume info (-name <volume_name> | -path <volume_path>)

   You must specify either name or path, but not both. For complete
   reference for this command, see [4]volume info.
