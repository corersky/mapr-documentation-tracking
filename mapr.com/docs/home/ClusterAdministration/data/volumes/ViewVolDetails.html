Viewing Volume Details

   You can retrieve and view volume information using MCS and the CLI.

Viewing Volume Details in the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Summary tab in the [1]volume information
   page for the volume.
   You can view the following in the Detail pane:
     * [2]Properties
     * [3]Authorization
     * [4]Usage
     * [5]Schedule

   CAPTION: Table 1. SETTINGS AND AUDITING

   Created By Indicates the user who created the volume.
   Volume Type Indicates the type of volume. Value can be one of the
   following:
     * Standard
     * Mirror

   Volume Name Indicates the name of the volume.
   Accountable Entity Indicates the name of the accountable entity.
   Volume Access Indicates the type of access allowed on the volume. Value
   can be one of the following:
     * Read/Write
     * Read-only

   Mounted Indicates whether or not volume is mounted.
   Mount Path Indicates the mount path of the volume.
   Data on Wire Encryption Indicates whether (Yes) or not (No) on-wire
   encryption is enabled for the volume.
   Data at Rest Encryption Indicates whether (Yes) or not (No)
   data-at-rest encryption (DARE) is enabled for the volume.
   Topology Indicates the rack path to the volume.
   Partially out of Topology Indicates whether containers associated with
   the volume are outside the volume's main topology.
   Last accessed Indicates the date when the volume was last accessed.
   Enable Auditing Indicates whether auditing is enabled at the volume
   level.
   Coalesce Interval Indicates the interval of time (in minutes) used for
   logging multiple READ, WRITE, or GETATTR operations on one file from
   one client IP address, if auditing is enabled.

   CAPTION: Table 2. REPLICATION (HOT)

   Replication Indicates the minimum (Min Target) and desired (Max Target)
   number of copies for the volume data.
   Name Container Replication Indicates the minimum (Min Target) and
   desired (Max Target) number of copies for the name container.
   Optimize Replication Indicates the basis for replication. Value can be
   one of the following:
     * High throughput, or cascading replication
     * Low latency, or star replication

   Guarantee Min Replication Indicates whether or not to enforce minimum
   number of copies.
   Note: The following is visible only if warm tiering is enabled for the
   volume.

   CAPTION: Table 3. ERASURE CODING (WARM)

   Topology Indicates the topology of the erasure-coded volume.
   Remote Target Indicates the name of the tier.
   Storage Policy Name Indicates the name of the storage policy.
   Policy Detail Indicates the rules in the policy for offloading data.
   Retention Duration after Recall Indicates the period of time to keep
   recalled data in the hot tier.
   Erasure Coding Scheme Indicates the number of data and parity chunks.
   Tier Purged Indicates the amount of offloaded data.
   Note: The following is visible only if cold tiering is enabled for the
   volume.

   CAPTION: Table 4. REMOTE ARCHIVING (COLD)

   Remote Target Indicates the name of the remote storage.
   Storage Policy Name Indicates the name of the storage policy.
   Policy Detail Indicates the rules in the policy for offloading data.
   Retention Duration after Recall Indicates the number of days to keep
   recalled data in the MapR cluster (hot tier).
   Tier Purged Indicates the amount of offloaded data.
   ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS Indicates the users and/or groups who:
     * Have admin access and/or full control on the volume.
     * Can perform one or more administrative operations such as create a
       dump file and backup the volume, restore and mirror the volume,
       edit the volume properties, and delete the volume.

   USER ACCESS CONTROLS Indicates the type of users — public, user, group,
   and/or role — that have and do not have access to volume data.
   Quota Indicates the amount of (advisory and hard) disk space allocated
   to the volume.
   Graph The graphs show:
     * DISKUSAGE: The total amount of disk space allocated for the volume
       and the amount of disk space used by the volume and associated
       snapshots.
     * CLUSTER DISKSPACE: The total amount of disk space on the cluster,
       the amount of disk space allocated and utilized by the volumes in
       the cluster, and the reserve limit.

   Snapshot Schedule Indicates the schedule for automatically creating a
   snapshot of the volume for the purpose of preserving the state of the
   volume.
   Mirror Schedule (Available only for mirror volumes) Indicates the
   schedule for automatically copying data (that has changed at the
   file-block level since the last data transfer) directly from the source
   volume to the mirror volume.
   Offload Schedule Indicates the schedule for automatically offloading
   data to the tier.

Viewing Volume Information Using the CLI or the REST API

   The basic command to retrieve volume information is:
maprcli volume info (-name <volume_name> | -path <volume_path>)

   You must specify either name or path, but not both. For complete
   reference for this command, see [6]volume info.
