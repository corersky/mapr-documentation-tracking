Viewing User Disk Usage Information

   You can view user disk usage information using MCS and the CLI.

Viewing User Disk Usage Information Using the MapR Control System

   To view information about disk usage by cluster users:
   Log in to MCS and go to the User Disk Usage tab under Data > Volumes.
   The disk usage information for all the users displays. For each user,
   the Accountable Entities pane displays the following:
     Column Name                         Column Description
  Type               The type of accountable entity. Value can be User or Group.
  Accountable Entity The user responsible for the volume.
  Disk Usage         The total disk space used by the user.
  Volume Count       The number of volumes.
  Hard Quota         The user's hard quota.
  Advisory Quota     The user's advisory quota.
  Email              The email address of the user.
   Selecting the checkbox beside an accountable entity makes the Edit
   Properties button available. You can modify the quotas for the selected
   entities by clicking [1]Edit Properties. Alternatively, you can click
   on an entity or associated [editPencil-Blue.png] to [2]modify the email
   address and quotas for the entity.
