Creating a Schedule

   You can create a schedule using MCS and the CLI.

Creating a Schedule Using the MapR Control System

   A schedule is a group of rules that specify recurring points in time at
   which certain actions are determined to occur. You can use schedules to
   automate the creation of snapshots and mirrors. To create a new
   schedule:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Schedules tab in the Data > Volumes
       page
    2. Click Create Schedule.
       The Create Schedule dialog displays.
    3. Enter a name for the schedule in the Schedule Name text field.
    4. Specify the schedule rules with the following components:

   Frequency Specify frequency (Once, Yearly, Monthly, Weekly, Daily,
   Hourly, Every X minutes).
   Time Specify the point of time within the specified frequency to
   perform the scheduled action. For example, if you selected Monthly from
   the first dropdown menu, select the day of the month from the second
   dropdown menu. Continue with each dropdown menu, proceeding to the
   right, to specify the time at which the scheduled action is to occur.

   Note: This is available only if the selected frequency is Once, Yearly,
   Monthly, Weekly, or Daily.
   Retain for Specify how long the data should be preserved. For example,
   if the schedule is attached to a volume for creating snapshots, the
   Retain for specifies how far after creation the snapshot expiration
   date is set.
       If necessary, click Add Another to add another rule to the schedule
       or [removeSetting.png] to remove a rule.
    5. Click Create Schedule to create the schedule.
       After the schedule is created, it appears as a choice in the
       scheduling menu when you are creating a new volume or editing a
       volume.

Creating a Schedule Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to create a schedule is:
