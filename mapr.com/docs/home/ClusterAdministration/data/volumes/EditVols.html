Modifying Multiple Volumes

   You can modify volumes using MCS and the CLI.

Modifying Volumes Using the MapR Control System

   To edit multiple volumes, in the Summary tab under Data > Volumes:
    1. Select the volumes to edit in the Volumes pane and click Edit
       Volume(s) from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Edit Volumes page displays. You can edit certain volume
       properties, authorization settings, usage settings, and schedule
       settings for the selected volumes.
    2. Modify one or more of the following settings.
       Note: If the selected volumes share the same settings, the fields
       are pre-populated with the current value. If the selected volumes
       contain different settings, only the fields that have been set in
       all the selected volumes display.

        Properties

   CAPTION:

   this volumeâ€™s usage.

   collection for this volume. For more information, see [1]Collecting

   Enable Auditing Select one of the following:
               o Disable auditing
               o Enable auditing for volume so that auditing can
                 selectively be enabled for directories, files, tables,
                 and streams in the volume
               o Enable auditing of operations on all files, tables,
                 streams in the volume whether or not auditing is enabled
                 for files, tables, and streams in the volume.

   Coalesce Interval Interval of time used when logging multiple instance
   of an operation on a node from a client IP, if auditing is enabled.
   Data on Wire Encryption Specifies whether (Yes) or not (No) to encrypt
   data in the volume during transfer. By default, the value is Yes for
   all new volumes in secure cluster. This is not supported on unsecure
   clusters.

   the volumes.
   Name Container Replication Desired and minimum number of copies of the
   name container associated with the volumes.
