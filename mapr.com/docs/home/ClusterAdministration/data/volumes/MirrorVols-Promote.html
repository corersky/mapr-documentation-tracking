Changing Mirror Volumes to Standard Volumes

   To change read-only mirror volumes to a read-write (standard) volumes,
   you must promote the mirror volumes to standard volumes. After the
   mirror volume is promoted, the snapshot schedule specified for the
   mirror is used for the promoted read-write volume and the mirror
   schedule is disabled. You can promote a mirror volume to a standard
   volume using MCS and the CLI.
   Note: When you use promotable mirrors, the volumes on the destination
   cluster must be set up in the same way as on the primary site. This
   means that volume names are the same and mount points are the same. If
   a hierarchical mounting structure (such as /A/B) is used on the primary
   site, the same structure must be recreated once mirror volumes are
   promoted at the secondary site.

Changing Multiple Mirror Volumes to Standard Volumes Using the MapR Control
System

   To change one or more mirror volumes to standard volumes, in the
   Summary tab under Data > Volumes:
    1. Select the mirror volumes to promote from the list of volumes in
       Volumes pane.
    2. Select Change to Standard Volume(s) from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Change to Standard Volume(s) confirmation dialog displays.
    3. Review the list of mirror volumes to promote and click Change
       Volume(s) to change the mirror volumes to standard volumes.

   Note: Mirror volumes that are promoted to standard (read-write) volumes
   are not available for write operations until they are mounted
   explicitly. For more information, see [1]Handling Mount Points in
   Promoted Mirror Volumes.

Changing a Mirror Volume to a Standard Volume Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the [2]volume information page for the
       mirror volume.
    2. Select Change to Standard Volume(s) from the Select Action dropdown
       menu.
       The Change to Standard Volume(s) confirmation dialog displays.
    3. Click Change Volume(s) to change the mirror volume to a standard
       volume.

   Note: Mirror volumes that are promoted to standard (read-write) volumes
   are not available for write operations until they are mounted
   explicitly. For more information, see [3]Handling Mount Points in
   Promoted Mirror Volumes.

Changing a Mirror Volume to a Standard Volume Using the CLI or REST API

   For changing a mirror volume to a standard (read/write) volume using
   the CLI, run the maprcli volume modify command with the -type option
   value set to rw on the cluster where the mirror volume resides and
   specify the name of the mirror volume that is being promoted. In the
   following example, the mirror volume is named volA:
Cluster2> maprcli volume modify -name volA -type rw

   For more information, see [4]volume modify.
   Note: Mirror volumes that are promoted to standard (read-write) volumes
   are not available for write operations until they are mounted
   explicitly. For more information, see [5]Handling Mount Points in
   Promoted Mirror Volumes.
