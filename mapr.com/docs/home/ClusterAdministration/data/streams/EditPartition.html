Modifying Topic Partitions

   You can modify the number of partitions using the MapR Control System
   and the CLI.
   Note: In general, you can increase the number of partitions, but you
   cannot reduce the number. However, if the topic is associated with a
   stream for change logs, you cannot modify the number of partitions.

Modifying Topic Partitions Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Topics tab in the [1]stream information
       page.
    2. Click [editPencil-Blue.png] in the Partitions column for the topic.
       The Edit Partition window displays.
    3. Modify the number of partitions and click Save Changes for the
       changes to take effect.

Modifying Topic Partitions Using the CLI or REST API

   The command to modify topic partitions is:
stream topic edit -path <stream path> -topic <topic name> -partitions <number of
 partitions>

   For complete reference information, see [2]stream topic edit.
