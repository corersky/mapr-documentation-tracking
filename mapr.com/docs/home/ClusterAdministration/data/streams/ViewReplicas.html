Viewing the List of Stream Replicas

   You can view the list of replicas for a stream using MCS and the CLI.

Viewing the List of Stream Replicas Using the MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Replication tab in the [1]stream
   information page.
   The Replicas pane displays the the list of replicas for the selected
   stream and for each replica, the pane displays the following:

   CAPTION:

   Column Name Column Description
   Paused Specifies whether replication is paused.
   Destination Cluster & Type The cluster on which the replica stream
   resides.
   Destination Path Specifies the name and path of the replica stream.
   Up to Date Specifies whether or not the replica is up-to-date.
   Earliest The date of the oldest message that has yet to be replicated.
   Latest The date of the newest message that has yet to be replicated.
   Errors Indicates if there were errors during replication.
   Compression Type The type of on-wire compression.
   Synchronous Specifies whether replication is synchronous.
   Throttled Specifies whether replication operations are throttled.
   Encrypted Specifies whether on-wire encryption is enabled.
   Selecting the checkbox beside a replica makes the Actions dropdown menu
   available. You can:
     * [2]Add a replica
     * [3]Edit a replica
     * [4]Pause a replica
     * [5]Resume replication
     * [6]Un-register replica(s)
     * [7]Set current stream as an upstream source
