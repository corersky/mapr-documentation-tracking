Adding Stream Replicas

   You can create stream replicas using MCS and the CLI. When you add a
   replica using the MCS, you can also set up and start replication
   between a source and replica stream.
   Before creating a replica:
    1. Review the following:
          + [1]Modes of Stream Replication
          + [2]Security for Stream Replication
          + [3]Preparing Clusters for Stream Replication

   Note:
     * You must replicate all of the topics that are in a stream. You
       cannot select only a subset of topics to replicate.
     * The maximum number of replicas that a stream can replicate to is
       64.
     * The maximum number of upstream sources that a replica can accept
       data from is 64.
     * In
          + Multi-master replication, names of topics must be unique on
            all streams. Messages are assigned sequential offsets. The
            offsets for messages in a topic in one copy could conflict
            with the offsets for messages in the other copy. As a result,
            messages could be lost.
          + Many-to-one replication, topics with the same name should not
            be replicated to an aggregate replica.

Adding a Replica Using the MapR Control System

   To add a replica using MCS:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Replication tab in the [4]stream
       information page.
    2. Click Add Replica.
       The Add Replica page displays.
    3. Specify the following settings.

   Path to Source Stream The path and name of the stream that you want to
   create a replica for.
   Destination Cluster The destination cluster for the replica, where
   gateways are configured to allow source cluster to send updates.
   Path to Replica The path and name of the replica stream.
   Replication State Specify whether or not to start replication by
   choosing one of the following:
          + Automatic Setup — Creates the stream on the destination
            cluster, registers the stream on the destination cluster as a
            replica, adds the current stream as an upstream source, copies
            the content of the current stream into the replica, and starts
            replication. In this case, the replica stream starts empty and
            accumulates messages over time.
          + Pause Replication — Creates the stream on the destination
            cluster, registers the stream on the destination cluster as a
            replica, adds the current stream as an upstream source, but
            prevents replication from immediately starting after. Pausing
            replica like this allows you to load the data into the replica
            from the current stream, after which you can restart
            replication.

   Note: If you are interested only in the messages that are published to
   the source stream after replication starts, then you do not need to
   pause replication initially. However, if you want the full set of
   messages from the source stream that have not yet been purged or marked
   for deletion, then pause replication initially.
   Multi-Master Setup (Available only with Automatic Setup) Multi-master
   topology, in which there are two master-slave relationships, with each
   stream playing both the role of a master and a slave. Client
   applications update both streams and each stream replicates updates to
   the other.

   If this is not selected, stream replication will be basic master-slave
   topology. In this topology, you replicate in one direction.
   See [5]Stream Replication for more information.
    4. Select values for the following optional settings.

   Throttle Specifies whether (Yes) or not (No) to throttle replication
   operations. Throttle the replication stream to minimize the impact of
   the replication process on incoming operations during periods of heavy
   load. By default, throttling is disabled.

   Throttling has two effects, both of which allow MapR-ES to use more
   system resources to process new messages:
          + Throttling slows down the rate at which changes to a stream
            are replicated.
          + Throttling slows down the rate at which messages to be
            replicated are read from disk.

   Replicate Synchronously Specifies whether replication is synchronous
   (Yes) or asynchronous (No). The default value is asynchronous
   replication.
   Encrypt On Wire Specifies whether (Yes) or not (No) to enable on-wire
   encryption. By default, this is disabled (No). If you enable on-wire
   encryption, the local cluster and any other cluster that is part of the
   replication process must be enabled for security.
   Compress On Wire Specifies the type of compression to use when
   replicating messages.
    5. Click Add Replica to create the replica.

Adding a Replica Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to create a replica is:
maprcli stream replica add -path <stream path> -replica <remote stream path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions
   on the:
     * Source cluster:
          + [6]readAce and [7]writeAce on the volume
          + [8]lookupdir on directories in the path
          + adminperm and copyperm permissions on the source stream
     * Target cluster:
          + [9]readAce and [10]writeAce on the volume
          + [11]lookupdir on directories in the path

   For complete reference, see [12]stream replica add.
   Note: You also have the option to set up replication with maprcli table
   replica autosetup which will set up and start replication. For more
   information, see [13]Setting Up Stream Replication Using the CLI.
