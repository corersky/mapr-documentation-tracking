Pausing Stream Replication

   You can pause replication from a source stream to a replica stream
   using MCS and the CLI.

Pausing Stream Replication Using the MapR Control System

   To pause one or more replications:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Replication tab in the [1]stream
       information page.
    2. Select the replicas to pause in the Replicas pane.
       Selecting the checkbox next to a replica makes the Actions dropdown
       menu available.
    3. Select Pause Replication from the Actions dropdown menu.
       The Pause Replication confirmation window displays.
    4. Verify the list of replicas to pause and click Pause Replication.
       This action pauses replication from the source stream to the
       selected replica stream(s).

Pausing Stream Replication Using the CLI or REST API

   The command to pause a replication is:
maprcli stream replica pause -path <stream path> -replica <remote stream path>
