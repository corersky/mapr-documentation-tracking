Administering Streams

   MapR Event Store For Apache Kafka brings integrated publish and
   subscribe messaging to the MapR Converged Data Platform. Producer
   applications can publish messages to topics, which are logical
   collections of messages, and Consumer applications can read those
   messages at their own pace. Topics are grouped into streams, for which
   administrators can apply security, retention, and replication policies.
