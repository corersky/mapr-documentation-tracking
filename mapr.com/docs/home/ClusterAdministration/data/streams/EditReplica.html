Editing a Stream Replica

   You can edit a stream replica using MCS and the CLI to modify the way
   in which messages are replicated from the source stream to the replica.

Editing a Stream Replica Using the MapR Control System

   To un-register one or more stream replicas from MCS:
    1. Log in to MCS and go to the Replication tab in the [1]stream
       information page.
    2. Click [editPencil-Blue.png] associated with the replica to edit in
       the Replicas pane.
       The Edit Replica page displays.
    3. Make necessary changes to any of the following properties.

   Path to Replica Specify path and name of the replica stream.
   Throttle Enable (Yes) or disable (No) throttling of replication
   operations. Throttle the replication stream to minimize the impact of
   the replication process on incoming operations during periods of heavy
   load. By default, throttling is disabled.

   Throttling has two effects, both of which allow MapR-ES to use more
   system resources to process new messages:
          + Throttling slows down the rate at which changes to a stream
            are replicated.
          + Throttling slows down the rate at which messages to be
            replicated are read from disk.

   Replicate Synchronously Set up synchronous (Yes) or asynchronous (No)
   replication.
   Encrypt On Wire Enable (Yes) or disable (No) on-wire encryption. By
   default, this is disabled (No). If you enable on-wire encryption, the
   local cluster and any other cluster that is part of the replication
   process must be enabled for security.
   Compress On Wire Specify type of compression to use when replicating
   messages.
    4. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

Editing a Stream Replica Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to modify a replica is:
stream replica edit -path <stream path> -replica <remote stream path>
