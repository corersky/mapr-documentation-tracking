Set up Stream as Upstream Source

   You can set up the current stream as the upstream source for a replica
   if the replica was not set up to automatically resync with the current
   stream.

Setting Up Current Stream as Upstream Source for a Replica Using the MapR
Control System

   To set up a stream as the upstream source for a replica:
    1. Go to the Replication tab in the [1]stream information page
    2. Select the checkbox beside the replica(s) that do not have the
       current stream configured as upstream source for automatic resync.
       Selecting a checkbox next to a replica makes the Actions dropdown
       menu available.
    3. Select Set Current Stream as Upstream Source from the Actions
       dropdown menu.
       The Set Current Stream as Upstream Source dialog displays.
    4. Review the list of selected replicas and click Set Upstream Source.
       The current stream will automatically send updates to the
       replica(s).
