Editing a Stream

   You can edit streams using MCS and the CLI.

Editing a Stream Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the [1]stream information page.
    2. Click Edit Stream.
       The Edit Stream page displays.
    3. Make necessary changes to one or more of the following:

   CAPTION:

   Property Description
   Time To Live The amount of time to elapse between the publication of a
   message in a topic in this stream and the expiration of that message.
   Choose:
          + Forever to retain messages indefinitely
          + Seconds to specify the number of seconds. A value of 0 causes
            messages to be retained indefinitely.

   Messages that have expired are deleted during the next purge process.
   See [2]Time-to-Live for Messages for details.
   Compression The compression setting to use for the stream. Producer
   client libraries can bundle messages that are to be published on the
   same partition and compress them. The messages are sent to the server
   compressed, are stored compressed, are replicated to other containers
   compressed, and (if stream replication is configured) replicated to
   replica streams compressed. Consumer client libraries receive
   compressed data, decompresses it, and passes it to client applications.

   Choose one of the following:
          + Inherited (to inherit from the directory where the stream is
            stored), which is the default setting
          + OFF (to disable compression)
          + LZF
          + LZF4
          + ZLIB

   Auto Create Topics Whether (Yes) or not (No) to create a topic
   automatically when a producer tries to write the first message to it.
   Default Partitions The default number of partitions to allocate to new
   topics in the stream.
   Compact Enable (Yes) or disable (No) log compaction. If enabled,
   obsolete records from topics are detected and deleted. By default, this
   is disabled (No).
    4. Add, modify, or remove access to streams for users, groups, and
       roles.
       For each user, group, and/or role, you can grant (by selecting the
       associated check box) or block (by deselecting the associated
       checkbox) the following types of access:

   CAPTION:

   Administer Can modify the access-control expressions for the stream,
   set up replication from the stream, and modify attributes of the
   stream.

   This permission includes the topic permission.
   Copy Stream Can copy data from one MapR stream to another MapR stream
   (using the mapr copystream utility) and compare the message IDs,
   metadata, and data in two MapR streams (using the mapr diffstreams
   utility).
   Topic Can create, edit, or remove topics in the stream.
   Producer Can publish messages to topics in the stream.
   Consumer Can listen to topics in the stream.
       To grant or block access to users, groups, and/or roles, choose one
       of the following:
          + Basic Settings: Select the type — public, (OR) user, group, or
            role — from the drop-down list and grant read and/or write
            permissions.
            Tip: Click [cloneACE.png] to create a copy of the associated
            access control setting. Click [deleteRow.png] to remove the
            associated access control expression.
            Click Add Another to add permissions for another user, group,
            or role.
          + Advanced Settings: Within empty strings (""), specify user
            (u), group (g), role (r), or public (p) who have and do not
            have read and/or write access using the following boolean
            expressions and subexpressions:
               o ! — Negation operator.
               o & — AND operation.
               o | — OR operation.
            Use (), parentheses, for subexpressions.
            Alternatively, click [editPencil.png] associated with the type
            of access to use the Access Control Expression window to
            define access for public or users, group, and/or role. See
            [3]Defining ACEs for more information.
       Note: If you switch from Basic to Advanced, the basic settings, if
       any, will be carried over to the Advanced settings. If you switch
       from Advanced to Basic, all the settings will be lost because the
       subexpressions and AND (&) and negation (!) operations that are
       supported by Advanced settings are not supported in the Basic
       settings.
       To add access control expressions for another user, group, or role,
       click Add Another and repeat this step.
    5. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

Editing a Stream Using the CLI or REST API

   The basic command to edit a stream is
maprcli stream edit -path <Stream Path>

   To run this command, your user ID must have the following permissions:
     * [4]readAce and [5]writeAce on the volume
     * [6]lookupdir on directories in the path
     * adminperm permission on the stream

   For complete reference information, see [7]stream edit.
