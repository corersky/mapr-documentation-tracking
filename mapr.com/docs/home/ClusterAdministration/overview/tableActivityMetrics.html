Viewing Per Node Metrics for Table Activities

   You can view per node metrics for table activities using the MapR
   Control System and Grafana. This section describes how to view the
   metrics as charts and lists in the MapR Control System. For information
   on visualizing the [1]metrics in the Grafana UI, see [2]Metric
   Visualization
   Note: The metrics collection infrastructure must be installed to
   visualize the metrics in the various panes. If the metrics collection
   infrastructure is not installed, perform an [3]Incremental Install to
   visualize the metrics as described below.
    1. Log in to MCS and go the Metrics tab in the [4]node information
       page.
    2. Select Activity by Tables from the dropdown menu.
       By default, the page displays charts that show metrics for the last
       24 hours. You can select a preset or specify a custom time range.

       You can also zoom in (by clicking and dragging the cursor in the
       pane) for a more granular view. Click Zoom Out to expand time
       window or click:
          + [blueGreaterThan.png] to shift time window forwards.
          + [blueLesserThan.png] to shift time window backwards.
       The charts show metrics for the node across tables. Click
       [tooltipIcon.png] associated with the chart to view information
       about the graph. Click [whitePencil.png] to display the Customize
       Active Charts window, where you can select charts to display and
       remove from the Available and Selected lists. You can view up to 6
       charts at a time in the page.
       You can switch to the list view by clicking [listView.png] . In the
       list view, you can:
          + Click the table name to go to the metrics page for the table.
          + Select one or more tables and switch to charts view (by
            clicking [chartView.png] ) to visualize metrics for the
            selected tables only.
       For the complete list of metrics that you can view at both the node
       and table levels, see [5]Viewing Table Metrics in the MapR Control
       System.
