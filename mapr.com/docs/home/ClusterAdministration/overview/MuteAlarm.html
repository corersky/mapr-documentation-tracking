Muting and Unmuting Alarms

   You can mute (silence) one or more (non-critical) alarms for a specific
   period of time using MCS and the CLI. The alarm will be silenced for
   the duration of the mute period and CLDB will raise the alarm again
   after the mute period only if the conditions for raising the alarm
   instance again are met.

       the alarm for from the Mute Alarms for dropdown list.
