Viewing Node Metrics

   You can view node metrics through the MapR Control System.
   Note: The metrics collection infrastructure must be installed during
   installation to visualize the metrics in the various panes. If the
   metrics collection infrastructure is not installed, perform an
   [1]Incremental Install to visualize the metrics described below.

Monitoring Node Metrics Using MapR Control System

   Log in to MCS and go to the Metrics tab in the [2]node information
   page.

   By default, the page displays charts that show metrics for the last 24
   hours. You can select a preset or specify a custom time range.

   You can also zoom in (by clicking and dragging the cursor in the pane)
   for a more granular view. Click Zoom Out to expand time window or
   click:
     * [blueGreaterThan.png] to shift time window forwards.
     * [blueLesserThan.png] to shift time window backwards.

   Click [tooltipIcon.png] associated with the chart to view information
   about the graph. Click [whitePencil.png] to display the Customize
   Active Charts window. You can select charts to display and remove from
   the Available and Selected lists in the Customize Active Charts window.
   You can view up to 6 charts at a time in the page.
   Use the following table when selecting the charts to view in the page.
   In the following table, the Charts column lists the charts that are
   available and the Metric column describes that type of metric that can
   be visualized in the chart:

   ^* This metric is diplayed in the default chart view for a node.

   ^** This metric is diplayed in the default chart view for a node and in
   the default list view for a table.

   ^*** This metric is diplayed in the default list view for a table.
   For information on viewing metrics for:
     * All table activities on a node, see [3]Viewing Per Node Metrics for
       Table Activities.
     * All stream activities on a node, see [4]Monitoring Streams
       Operations Using the MapR Control System.
