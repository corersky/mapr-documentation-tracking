Monitoring YARN

   Log in to the MapR Control System and:
     * Click Overview to view the following in the YARN pane:
          + Number of node managers, running applications, and queued
            jobs.
          + Memory and CPU utilization metrics.
     * Go to the [1]service information page for YARN. The YARN
       information page displays the following panes:

        Summary
                Displays:

               o Total number of nodes and number of active and unhealthy
                 nodes.
               o Allocated, pending, and reserved number of Resource
                 Manager containers.

        Top Queues by CPU Utilization
                Displays the queues that utilize the most CPU (in
                percentage).

        Top Queues by Memory Consumption
                Displays the queues that consume the most memory (in
                percentage).

        Applications
                Displays the number of submitted, completed, running,
                pending, and failed applications during a selected date
                and time range. You can select a preset (last 15 minutes,
                last 1 hour, last 12 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days,
                last 90 days) or custom time range and zoom in (by
                clicking and dragging the cursor in the pane) for a more
                granular view.

        Resource Manager (CPU)
                The number of cores allocated and used by Resource Manager
                during a selected date and time range. You can select a
                preset (last 15 minutes, last 1 hour, last 12 hours, last
                7 days, last 30 days, last 90 days) or custom time range
                and zoom in (by clicking and dragging the cursor in the
                pane) for a more granular view.

        Resource Manager (Memory)
                The amount (in MB) of memory allocated and used by
                Resource Manager during a selected date and time range.
                You can select a preset (last 15 minutes, last 1 hour,
                last 12 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days, last 90 days) or
                custom time range and zoom in (by clicking and dragging
                the cursor in the pane) for a more granular view.

   Note: The metrics collection infrastructure must be installed during
   installation to visualize the metrics in the various panes. If the
   metrics collection infrastructure is not installed, perform an
   [2]Incremental Install to install the metrics collection
   infrastructure.
