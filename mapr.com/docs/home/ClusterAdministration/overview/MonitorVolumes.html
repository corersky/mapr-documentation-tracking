Monitoring Volumes

   You can monitor volume:
     * [1]Disk usage
     * [2]Alarms

Monitoring Volume Disk Usage Using the MapR Control System

   You can view:
     * Volumes that use the most amount of allocated disk space in the Top
       Volume Utilization pane under Data > Volumes.
     * Disk usage trend for a volume in the Usage Trends pane in the
       Summary tab of the [3]volume information page. You can select a
       preset (shown in the following screenshot) or specify a custom time
       range (shown in the following screenshot).

       You can zoom in (by clicking and dragging the cursor in the pane)
       for a more granular view. Click Reset Zoom to zoom out and return
       to selected date/time range view.

   Note: The metrics collection infrastructure must be installed during
   installation to visualize the metrics in the various panes. If the
   metrics collection infrastructure is not installed, perform an
   [4]Incremental Install to view the charts described here.

Monitoring Volume Alarms in the MapR Control System

   See [5]Viewing Active Volume Alarms.

Monitoring Local and Remote Storage for Volumes

   You can view the following storage utilization metrics for tiered
   volumes in the Data > Volumes page Storage Utilization pane.
     * Local — The total disk space (in GB) used (before compression) for
       the volumes in the MapR cluster. This value does not include
       erasure-coded backend volumes and cache-volumes because their
       logical usage is already accounted for by the front-end and parent
       volumes respectively.
     * Cold Offloaded — The total physical data (in GB) offloaded to the
       cold tier. This is calculated using the following: amount of data
       purged from the hot tier (MapR cluster) + amount of data recalled
       to the hot tier (MapR cluster).
     * Warm Offloaded — The total physical data (in GB) offloaded to the
       erasure coded volume (warm tier). This is calculated using the
       following: amount of data purged from the hot tier (MapR cluster) +
       amount of data recalled to the hot tier (MapR cluster).
