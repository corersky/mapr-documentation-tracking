Managing Drill

   You can install and run a Drillbit service on one node or on all of the
   nodes in a MapR cluster to form a distributed cluster environment.
   After you have installed Drill and configured connections to your data
   sources, you can view Drill metrics and manage Drillbits using the MapR
   Control System.
