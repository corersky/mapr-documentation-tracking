Sample Configurations

   You can refer to the following sections, which contain blocks for the
   various required configurations using sample values.

Configuration for Supported NFS Protocols

   To specify the supported NFS protocols, set the value for the
   NFS_Protocols parameter in the /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf file. For
   example, for NFSv4 protocol, in the /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf
   file, set the value for the NFS_Protocols parameter as shown (in bold)
   below.
NFS_CORE_PARAM
{
        Plugins_Dir = /opt/mapr/lib;
        NFS_Protocols = 4;
        Clustered = false;
}

   Note: The only supported protocol is 4.

   For NFSv4, the showmount command does not return the list of exported
   NFS shares.

Configuration for Mounting the Cluster

   Add the MAPRFS block in the /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf file as
   shown below.
MAPRFS
{
  #Directory path where nfsv4 logs should be stored
  log_path = /opt/mapr/logs/nfs4;

  #Set number of readahead sessions
  ra_sessions = 5;

  #Flush all writes inline
  flush_inline = true;

  #Optimize for local direct writes
  fast_local_directio = false;

  #Set security ticket file
  tkt_location = /tmp/maprticket_XXX;

  #Hearbeat interval for NFSv4 (in seconds)
  hb_interval = 5;

  #Request threshold, logs warning if any request takes more time (in seconds)
  req_threshold = 5;
}

Configuration for Exporting the File System

   Modify the EXPORT block in the /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf file as
   shown (in bold) below. The following sample block shows a standard
   configuration where the exported path and the actual path are the same.
EXPORT
{
     # Export Id (mandatory, each EXPORT must have a unique Export_Id)
     Export_Id = 77;

     # Exported path (mandatory)
     Path = /mapr;

     # Pseudo Path (required for NFS v4)
     Pseudo = /mapr;

     # Required for access (default is None)
     # Could use CLIENT blocks instead
     Access_Type = RW;
     Squash = No_root_squash;
     SecType=krb5;

     # Exporting FSAL
     FSAL{
         Name = MAPR;
     }
}

   Note: If you change anything in the export block, restart NFSv4 service
   and remount the path.

Configuration for Pseudo Path

   To mask the path to the volume from the client, set the pseudo path.
   For the pseudo path, you can specify a value that is different from the
   path parameter to hide the true path name. To hide the full path to
   volumes and/or directories, specify the complete path in the EXPORT
   block.

   For example, modify the EXPORT block in the
   /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf file as shown (in bold) below to mask
   the path and show only the name of the volume to the client. Note that
   the following sample block shows a pseudo path that is different from
   the exported path.
EXPORT
{
    # Export Id (mandatory, each EXPORT must have a unique Export_Id)
    Export_Id = 77;

    # Exported path (mandatory)
    Path = /mapr;

    # Pseudo Path (required for NFS v4)
    Pseudo = /vol1;

    # Required for access (default is None)
    # Could use CLIENT blocks instead
    Access_Type = RW;
    Squash = No_root_squash;

    # Exporting FSAL
    FSAL{
       Name = MAPR;
    }
}

Configuration for Security

   The NFS client to NFS Server can be secured using Kerberos. Before
   configuring Kerberos to work with MapR, modify the
   /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf file to specify the security type. For
   example, modify the EXPORT block in the /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf
   file as shown (in bold) below.
EXPORT
{
    # Export Id (mandatory, each EXPORT must have a unique Export_Id)
    Export_Id = 77;

    # Exported path (mandatory)
    Path = /mapr;

    # Pseudo Path (required for NFS v4)
    Pseudo = /vol1;

    # Required for access (default is None)
    # Could use CLIENT blocks instead
    Access_Type = RW;
    Squash = No_root_squash;
    SecType=krb5;

    # Exporting FSAL
    FSAL{
        Name = MAPR;
    }
}

   The NFSv4 server uses the ticket in /opt/mapr/conf directory, if it is
   present, to secure communication between the NFS server and the MapR
   cluster.

Configuration for NFS Ganesha Debug Logging

   Add the following block in the /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf file.
LOG {
  COMPONENTS {
    ALL = DEBUG;
  }
}
