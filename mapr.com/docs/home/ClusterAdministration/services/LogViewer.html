Viewing the Service Log

   If Kibana is installed on the node, you can view the service log in the
   Kibana UI from the MapR Control System. To view the log in the Kibana
   UI from MCS:
    1. Log in to MCS and do one of the following:
          + Click Services to display the list of services installed on
            the cluster.
          + Go to the Summary tab in the [1]service information page for
            the service.
    2. Click [logViewer.png] in the Log Viewer column to view the log for
       the associated service in the Kibana UI.
       See [2]Kibana User Guide for more information.
