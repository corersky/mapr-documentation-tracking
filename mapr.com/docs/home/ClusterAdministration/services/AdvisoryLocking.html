Advisory Locking in NFSv4

   MapR NFSv4 service includes support for (advisory) file locking. MapR
   keeps track of the locks on a file in the NFS gateway, but does not
   prevent a client process from writing to a file that is locked by
   another process. The locks are not shared with other NFS gateways.
   Because the locks are enforced locally, it is the responsibility of the
   client process to check for write locks on a file before attempting to
   perform write operations on the file.

   To ensure that a file is locked and not available for changes by other
   processes and to ensure that the lock on a file by a process is honored
   by other processes, add a program similar to the following for the
   process.
     * [1]Sample Program Description
     * [2]Sample Program Code

   The following program demonstrates how to open a file, check if the
   file has a write lock, and wait if another process currently has locked
   the file.

   Before running this application, ensure that you have access to a
   cluster running MapR Filesystem.

   Opens a file

  if (argc > 1) {
    int fd = open(argv[1], O_WRONLY);
    if(fd == -1) {
      printf("Unable to open the file\n");
      exit(1);
    }

   Checks if the file is locked for a write operation

    lock.l_type = F_WRLCK;
    lock.l_start = 0;
    lock.l_whence = SEEK_SET;
    lock.l_len = 0;
    lock.l_pid = getpid();

   Gets lock, else waits

    int ret = fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, &amp;lock);
    printf("Return value of fcntl:%d\n",ret);
    if(ret==0) {
      while (1) {
        scanf("%c", NULL);
      }
    }

#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argc > 1) {
    int fd = open(argv[1], O_WRONLY);
    if(fd == -1) {
      printf("Unable to open the file\n");
      exit(1);
    }
    static struct flock lock;

    lock.l_type = F_WRLCK;
    lock.l_start = 0;
    lock.l_whence = SEEK_SET;
    lock.l_len = 0;
    lock.l_pid = getpid();

    int ret = fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, &lock);
    printf("Return value of fcntl:%d\n",ret);
    if(ret==0) {
      while (1) {
        scanf("%c", NULL);
      }
    }
  }
}
