NFSv4 Troubleshooting

   Issues with listing the exports:
          If nfs4mgr list-exports command returns the error, Error
          org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name
          org.ganesha.nfsd was not provided by any .service files, do the
          following to resolve the error:

         1. Open the /etc/dbus-1/system.conf file.
         2. Find and replace the following in the file:
              a. Find:
<deny send_destination="org.freedesktop.DBus"
 send_interface="org.freedesktop.DBus"
 send_member="UpdateActivationEnvironment"/>
              b. Replace with:
<!-- Allow anyone to talk to the message bus -->
<allow send_destination="org.freedesktop.DBus"/>
<!-- But disallow some specific bus services -->
<allow send_interface="*"/>
<allow receive_interface="*"/>
<allow own="*"/>
         3. Save and close the file.
         4. Restart the messagebus and NFSv4 service.
            To restart the messagebus service, run the following command:
service messagebus restart
            To restart NFSv4 service, see [1]Starting, Stopping, and
            Restarting MapR NFSv4.

   Lock expires as a result of problems in node connection or node
          failover:
          If the lock expires as a result of problems in node connection
          or node failover, all IOs from the application will fail with
          EIO message to prevent the file from getting corrupted. You can
          tune the kernel to reclaim lost locks and not fail writes on
          lock lease expiration. To tune the kernel, run the following
          command:

echo Y > /sys/module/nfs/parameters/recover_lost_locks

          Warning: This kernel tuning this might result in data
          corruption.

   User ID mapping is not working when NFSv4 server and client are in two
          different sub-domains:
          If user ID (with FQDN user names) mapping is not working with
          the installed libnfsidmap library (for example,
          libnfsidmap-0.25-19 on Centos), do the following:

         1. Download the latest libnfsidmap library for the OS.
            For CentOS:
              a. Download the library source with the patches.
              b. Apply the patches till
                 libnfsidmap-0.25-dns-resolved.patch.
              c. Build the new library.
         2. Stop NFSv4 service and replace the old library with the new
            library.
         3. Replace the old nsswitch.so file with the new nsswitch.so file
            that is compiled.
         4. Restart rpcidmapd service and NFSv4 service.

   NFS Ganesha crashes when unmounting the cluster:
          NFS Ganesha crashes when unmounting the cluster as a non-root
          user. Download and install the following Kerberos 16 package:

          + sssd-krb5-common-1.16.0-19.el7.x86_64
          + sssd-krb5-1.16.0-19.el7.x86_64

   Discover realm command fails:
          If the realm discover command fails with following error: realm:
          Couldn't connect to realm service: Error calling
          StartServiceByName for org.freedesktop.realmd:
          GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.TimedOut: Activation of
          org.freedesktop.realmd timed out, reboot the node and add Active
          Directory information in the /etc/resolv.conf again. For
          example, your entry in the /etc/resolv.conf file should look
          similar to the following:

# cat /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 10.10.111.41
domain nfs4ad.com
search nfs4ad.com lab qa.lab scale.lab perf.lab ipmi.lab

   Unable to start the service:
          If you or the warden is unable to restart the NFS service, do
          the following:

         1. Review the warden logs (in $MAPR_HOME/logs/warden.log file) to
            determine when the [2]NFSv4 Service Alarm was raised.
         2. Review the following NFSv4 server logs in
            $MAPR_HOME/logs/nfs4/nfs4server.log-0 and
            $MAPR_HOME/logs/nfs4/fsal.log-0, and other logs under
            $MAPR_HOME/logs/nfs4 on the node where the service went down
            to determine the cause for the error.
            The following example logs show some common causes for NFSv4
            service shutting down such as license not present or an issue
            in the configuration.
