Unmounting the MapR Cluster from the Command-Line

   To unmount the MapR cluster, run the umount command.
   For example, to unmount the cluster in /mapr, run the following
   command:
umount /mapr

   If a process is busy on the mount point, the umount command will fail.
   To unmount the cluster after the process completes, run the following
   command:
umount -l /mapr
