Mounting NFS on a Linux Client

   You can manually mount NFS on a Linux client when your system starts
   up.
   Note: On nodes running CentOS, use the VIP for mounting because, by
   default, the mount command will use the physical IP of the node.
    1. List the NFS shares exported on the server.
       For example, run the following command:
/opt/mapr/server/nfs4mgr list-exports
       If the protocol is not v4 only, the showmount command can be used
       to retrieve the list of exported NFS shares. For example:
showmount -e usa-node01
    2. Mount the cluster via NFS.
       For example:
mount -t nfs4 -o sec=krb5 usa-node01:/<psuedo_mapr> /mapr

   Note: When you mount manually from the command line, the mount point
   does not persist after a reboot.
