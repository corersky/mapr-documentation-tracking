Configuring NFSv4 Server

   You can configure NFSv4 server by setting the values for the parameters
   in the /opt/mapr/conf/nfs4server.conf file. The configuration
   parameters are defined within blocks in the file. The following
   sections describe the blocks and required parameters (within each
   block) for the MapR NFSv4 server.

   NFS_CORE_PARAM
          Contains the general settings for the daemon. The parameters in
          this block should not be modified.

   CAPTION:

   Clustered The value is false. Do not modify this parameter.
   Plugins_Dir The directory for the FSAL libraries. The value is
   /opt/mapr/lib. Do not modify this parameter.
   DRC_TCP_Size The maximum number of results stored in the DRC. The
   default value is 16.
   DRC_TCP_Recycle_Expire_S The amount of time after which to expire
   results stored in DRC. The default value is 60 seconds.
   Dirent_Entries_Track Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to monitor
   dirent entries. If true, the process restarts if the number of dirent
   entries exceeds limit.
   Num_Log_Files The maximum number of log files. The default value is 1.
   Max_Logfile_Size The maximum amount of space for each log file. The
   default value is 1073741824. The total amount of disk space for log
   files is calculated using the following:
Num_Log_Files * Max_LogFile_Size

   For example, suppose Num_Log_Files = 32 and Max_LogFile_Size = 1GB.
   Then, the total disk space for log files is 32GB.
   Enable_RQUOTA Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to enable support
   for remote quotas. The default value is false.
   NFS_Protocols The supported NFS protocols. The only supported value is
   4.

   NFSV4
          Contains settings for NFSv4 protocol. The following parameter
          should not be modified.

   CAPTION:

   Delegations boolean Specifies whether delegation is supported. The
   default value is false and should not be modified (cannot be set to
   true) as delegation is not supported.
   Dirent_Cache_Threshold 128 The threshold for caching directory entries.
   If directory entries exceed threshold, the entries are not cached;
   caching is enabled only if entries are below this threshold.

   Note: This should be used only if readdirplus is true.

   EXPORT_DEFAULTS
          Contains default values for all subsequent EXPORT blocks. The
          settings in subsequent EXPORT blocks can override these default
          values on a per export basis.

   CAPTION:

   Anonymous_Uid The anonymous UID. The default value is -2, which is
   converted to a 32 bit unsigned integer (4294967294) when root squash is
   enabled.
   Anonymous_Gid The anonymous GID. The default value is -2, which is
   converted to a 32 bit unsigned integer (4294967294) when root squash is
   enabled.
   Protocols The supported NFS protocols. The default value is 4. This
   cannot be changed.

   EXPORT
          Contains settings for exporting a filesystem.

   CAPTION:

   SecType The comma-separated list of supported authentication flavors
   for the export or the type of security. Value can be comma-separated
   list of:
          + krb5 — authentication
          + krb5i — integrity
          + krb5p — privacy

   Note: This must be specified if you want the clients to use kerberos
   ticket for secure access.
   Path (Required) The (cluster) path to export via NFS. The path should
   have a leading slash. If just /mapr is specified as the path, all the
   clusters (listed in the mapr-clusters.conf file) will be visible. To
   export only a specific cluster, specify the complete path to the
   cluster to export.

   Note: Exporting will not be successful if extra forward slash (/)
   characters are in the path. For example, the following path will not be
   exported because of the extra slash (shown in bold) in the path:
   /mapr/Test3//ATS-VOLUME
   Pseudo (Required for NFSv4 protocol for every directory or volume to
   export) The pseudo path, which when specified, masks the mount path
   from the NFS client, for the NFSv4 exports. MapR’s NFSv4 server
   provides a pseudo-file system where only the exported volumes are
   visible. This is especially useful in scenarios where one or more
   volumes in the hierarchy should be hidden and not be visible. When
   mounting with NFSv4, use the pseudo path. Value can be the volume or
   directory path.
   Export_Id (Required) The tag used to set the ID for the export or the
   unique ID to associate with each export. Value should not be 0.

   Note: The export ID associated with each export must be the same across
   all NFSv4 servers on the cluster.
   Squash Specifies whether to enable or disable root squashing. By
   default, root squashing is disabled. If root squash is enabled, the
   values substituted for the root user will be anonymous user
   (Anonymous_Uid and Anonymouos_Gid); that is, the UID and GID of a file
   created will not be nfsnobody because the default value of -2 is
   converted to a 32 bit unsigned integer (4294967294) instead of the 16
   bit equivalent (65534), which is the value of nfsnobody.
   Access_Type (Required) The type of access on the mount point. Valid
   values include:
          + RO — for read-only mount point
          + RW — for read/write mount point
          + MDONLY — for read/write access to metadata only
          + MDONLY_RO — for read-only access to metadata only

   FSAL (Required) The file system to use. Value must be MAPR to use the
   MapR Filesystem libfsalmapr.so library, which contains the shared
   library (libMapRClient) and the callbacks.

   LOG
          Contains configuration for logging. The default log level is
          INFO. Value can be one of the following:

          + FATAL
          + MAJ
          + CRIT
          + WARN
          + EVENT
          + INFO
          + DEBUG
          + MID_DEBUG
          + FULL_DEBUG

   MAPRFS
          Contains configurations for NFS gateway access to MapR file
          system.

   CAPTION:

   Parameter Default Value Description
   log_path /opt/mapr/logs/nfs4 Path for the log files.
   ra_sessions 5 Number of parallel read ahead sessions per client library
   (libMapRClient.so). Each open file acts as one read ahead session. For
   example, if value is set to 5, up to 5 files can have read ahead
   sessions per client library (libMapRClient.so). To disable read ahead
   sessions, set value to 0.

   Note: The number of client libraries is 3 by default and cannot be
   configured.
   flush_inline true Specifies whether or not to flush all writes inline.
   Value can be:
          + true — flush all writes inline
          + false — disable inline flushing

   If enabled (default), writes are sent to server directly. If disabled,
   for all open files, the buffer is flushed automatically every 3 seconds
   or when it reaches 64KB.
   fast_local_directio false Specifies whether to optimize or disable NFS
   client for local direct IO. Value can be:
          + true — optimize
          + false — disable

   nfs_track_memory false Specifies whether to enable (true) or disable
   (false) memory tracking for NFS.
   hb_interval 5 The interval (in seconds) for sending heartbeat to CLDB
   to allow CLDB to determine whether server is running. The CLDB will
   declare the NFS gateway dead when it loses about 8 heartbeats in a row
   and will trigger a failover.
   req_threshold 5 The amount of time (in seconds) for processing
   requests. If the threshold is exceeded, warnings will be logged.
   client_lib_path /tmp/nfs4 The location for the client library
   (libMapRClient).

   Note: To install and use NFSv4 and FUSE-based POSIX client on the same
   node, ensure that the path for the client library for the NFSv4 and
   FUSE-based POSIX client is not /tmp. Specify a different location for
   the client libraries. For example, /tmp/nfs4lib.
   readdirplus true Specifies whether (true) or not (false) to enable
   extended read from the directory. If enabled (true), each entry returns
   the name, the file ID, attributes (including the field), and file
   handle.

   Note:
     * The libnfsidmap must be configured to use nsswitch, a translation
       mechanism for mapping names to IDs, in the /etc/idmapd.conf file.
     * The NFSv3 (mapr-nfsserver) nodes cannot failover to NFSv4 server
       nodes and vice versa. Ensure that different set of VIPs are
       assigned for NFSv3 and NFSv4 server nodes. When running the maprcli
       virtualip add command to set up VIPs, list the MACs of the
       respective nodes so that the failover works properly (this is
       necessary if both NFSv3 and NFSv4 are going to be set up for same
       cluster). The MACs should be mutually exclusive as both NFSv4 and
       NFSv3 servers cannot run on the same node.
