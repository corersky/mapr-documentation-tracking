Editing a VIP

   You can modify the VIP range using MCS and the CLI. You cannot edit a
   VIP using MCS in v6.0.1.

Editing a VIP Using the MapR Control System

    1. Log in to MCS and go to the [1]service information page for NFS.
    2. Click the VIP Range to modify.
       The Edit Virtual IP page displays.
    3. Modify changes to one or more of the following as needed.

   Preferred MAC Address The preferred MAC for this virtual IP. When an
   NFS server restarts, the MapR system attempts to move all of the
   virtual IP addresses that list a MAC address on this node as a
   preferred MAC to this node. If the new value is null, this field resets
   the preferred MAC value.
   Select network interfaces The list of MAC addresses that represent the
   NICs on the nodes that the VIPs in the VIP range can be associated
   with. Use this list to limit VIP assignment to NICs on a particular
   subnet when your NFS server is part of multiple subnets.
    4. Click Save Changes for the changes to take effect.

Editing a VIP Using the CLI and REST API

   CLI
          The basic command to modify a VIP range is:

maprcli virtualip edit -netmask <netmask> -virtualip <virtualip>

   REST
          Send a request of type POST. For example:

durl -k -X POST 'https://<host>:8443/rest/virtualip/edit?netmast<netmask>&virtua
lip=<vip>' --user mapr:mapr

   For the complete list of required and optional parameters, see
   [2]virtualip edit.
